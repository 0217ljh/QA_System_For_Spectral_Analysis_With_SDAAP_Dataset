Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity.

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to investigate the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for individual finger-tapping tasks and to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms in classifying the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study involved 24 healthy volunteers who participated in an individual finger-tapping experiment. Data were acquired from the motor cortex using sixteen sources and sixteen detectors. The fNIRS data underwent standard processing steps, including optical densities conversion, signal processing, feature extraction, and classification algorithm implementation. Physiological and non-physiological noise were removed using specific filters. Eight spatial statistical features were selected from the data of oxygenated haemoglobin changes. Various machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), AdaBoost, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were applied for classification. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The average classification accuracies achieved were 0.75\u00b10.04, 0.75\u00b10.05, and 0.77\u00b10.06 using k-nearest neighbors (kNN), random forest (RF), and XGBoost, respectively. The kNN, RF, and XGBoost classifiers performed exceptionally well on the high-class problem of individual finger-tapping. However, the results need to be further investigated, and a more in-depth analysis of the signal in both temporal and spatial domains is planned for future research.

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to investigate the brain activity of a senior driver in response to simulated unexpected vehicle motion, compared with a relaxed state and normal driving. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study used a driving simulator paradigm with three scenarios: sitting down and relaxing, normal driving around the city, and exiting a parking area. In the parking area scenario, the gear was switched automatically without the driver being notified, creating an unexpected condition. The driver's internal states were classified using artificial intelligence and near-infrared spectroscopy. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study found significant differences in the hemodynamic responses obtained in the three conditions. The researchers concluded that a driver's internal states in a panic situation while driving can be detected using near-infrared spectroscopy and artificial intelligence. This method can be used to update advanced driver assistance systems and activate in-vehicle safety functions based on the driver's condition, with the aim of preventing future traffic accidents. ###",

The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed.

The spatial model in the study considers the spatial dimension and autocorrelation in plant trait observations, enhancing accuracy when significant autocorrelation is present. Traditional methods may not account for spatial dependency as effectively, limiting their generalizability to landscapes with different patterns."

Methods: The researchers used near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics to develop the model. They first screened 11 key wavelength variables using synergy interval partial least-squares regression (SI-PLS) and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS).

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Methods: The study used the spatial aggregation method to analyze the optimal grid size of Sentinel-2 data for lodging percentage estimation. The spectral response for different lodging percentage levels was investigated, and the potential of lodging percentage estimation for Sentinel-2 metrics (including selected spectral bands and vegetation indexes) was analyzed.

Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to address the deficiencies in visible-near infrared spectral identification of coal gangue under different working conditions by employing multiple algorithms to construct local and global recognition models and conducting analysis. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The paper simulates five different working conditions in the laboratory, including different detection angles, illumination angles, detection distances, coal powder content, and moisture content. Spectral data of coal and gangue samples are collected. Global and local datasets are constructed, derived from all levels and single levels under certain working conditions. Machine learning algorithms such as Lightgbm and 1DCNN are used to train local and global models for sample identification. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The results of the experiment show that there are variations in the sample spectra and recognition accuracy based on different working conditions. The local model exhibits lower recognition accuracy and inadequate robustness for other level samples under the same working condition. The global model, particularly the Lightgbm global model, is more robust and practical, achieving higher or equal recognition accuracy for local data compared to the local model. The Lightgbm global model has an average F1-score of 99.34% and 97.9% for local and global datasets, respectively, with fast training and recognition times. It can accurately identify coal and gangue in various working conditions, making it a reliable solution. ###",
        "Output": "The visible and near infrared spectra impact the overall findings in the related research by showing that the spectral reflectance of coal and gangue increases with the increase of wavelength. Additionally, the absorption peaks and valleys in the coal gangue spectrum change with factors such as detection angle, illumination angle, coal powder content, and moisture content, affecting the overall spectral reflectance. These variations in the spectra provide valuable information for quickly and accurately identifying the quality of coal based on the analysis of absorption peaks, reflectance changes, and spectral characteristics."

Methods: The study used hyperspectral remote sensing techniques to estimate canopy nitrogen content in cotton. The Relief-F method was employed to select the best spectral band with weight for ANC that is insensitive to VZA. The AINI was calculated using the expression (R-530 - R-704)/(R-1412 + R-704). The correlation between the spectral index and ANC was analyzed under different VZAs. The ANC estimation model of the optimal indices AINI and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) was combined with the random forest (RF) machine learning method. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study found that the AINI index can estimate cotton ANC under different VZAs. The correlation between the spectral index and ANC was stronger than the correlation between off-nadir observations. The correlation coefficients between PRI, AINI, and ANC were highest when VZA was -20 degrees and -50 degrees. AINI had the best correlation with ANC under different VZAs, and the performance of ANC in the backscatter direction was estimated to be better than that in the forward-scatter direction. The combination of the ANC estimation model using AINI and PRI with the RF machine learning method achieved high accuracy, with an R-2 value of 0.98 and RMSE of 0.590.

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to improve the potential of visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy in predicting the contents of salt and major soluble ions in the topsoil at Hetao Irrigation District in Inner Mongolia, China. ###\n\nP2. Methods: A total of 120 soil samples were collected from the field, with a sampling depth of 0-20 cm. Fractional-order derivatives (FODs) were used for soil spectral pretreatment, with intervals of 0.05 and a range of 0-2. Coefficient of determination (R-2) was used to determine the optimal FOD spectrums of the soil salt and major soluble ions. Extreme learning machine (ELM) models were calibrated using various spectral parameters, and different algorithms including Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MCUVE), iteratively retaining informative variables (IRIV), and bootstrapping soft shrinkage (BOSS) were applied to variable selection. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study found that the correlation between the contents of soil salt and soluble ions and FOD spectra increased as the derivative order increased. The optimal FOD spectra for different ions varied, with the newly proposed three-band index (TBI4) showing a better correlation with ion content. The IRIV-ELM models generally outperformed the MCUVE-ELM and BOSS-ELM models in estimating the contents of soil salt and soluble ions. The prediction accuracy varied among different ions, with some ions having high accuracy while others had relatively lower accuracy. However, the models reached and even exceeded the quantitative prediction level, indicating that the contents of soil salt and soluble ions could be estimated using the FOD algorithm and the optimal combination of spectral indices. ###",

Different salinity information also impacted the performance of the indices, with K+, HCO3 \u2013, and CO3 2\u2013 showing lower correlation compared to SSC and other ions. Overall, increasing the dimension of the multi-dimensional spectral index, by combining more wavelengths, can potentially enhance the correlation threshold and provide higher quality variables for modeling."

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to explore the potential of a hybrid method and a data-driven method for retrieving soil moisture content (SMC) using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and to identify factors that favor and limit the retrieval of SMC in different grassland sites. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses a hybrid method that targets the soil brightness factor of the PROSAIL model using a variational heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes regression (VHGPR) algorithm. It also employs a data-driven method using VHGPR for the retrieval of SMC based on UAS-borne VIS-NIR hyperspectral data. The study is conducted at three grassland sites managed by mowing, grazing, and irrigation. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The hybrid approach shows encouraging results in one of the grassland sites, but the presence of a thatch layer in the other grassland sites limits its application. The data-driven approach shows high accuracy in two of the grassland sites, but the relationship between leaf area index (LAI) and SMC is hampered by mowing and grazing.

Methods: The study collected 266 full-range proximal spectral measurements and corresponding ground truth observations in Australia and the Netherlands from May to November 2018. An exhaustive-search based on a genetic algorithm was used to select band subsets within different regions and across the full spectral range, minimizing the number of bands and an error metric.

Eleven sparse broad bands of 10 nm bandwidth within this range provided better or equivalent performance compared to previous studies that used a higher number of bands and narrower bandwidths. The highest accuracy was achieved when estimating crude protein on its weight-per-area basis.

The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for SVM were 91.0%, 100%, 94.8%, and 95.8% respectively, while for CNN they were 84.8%, 92.0%, 88.8%, and 95.5% respectively. Raman spectroscopy was concluded to be a powerful tool for detecting EGC and elucidating biomolecular dynamics in tumorigenesis. ###",
        "Output": "Raman spectroscopy can be beneficial in identifying precancerous lesions and early-stage cancers in gastric cancer detection by analyzing the Raman spectra of gastric tissues and nuclei, detecting stable differences in biomolecular constituents such as proteins, lipids, and carotenoids, and generating ROC curves to evaluate diagnostic performance, ultimately providing clues for mechanism research and aiding in the early detection of neoplastic lesions."

Methods: The study utilizes long-term MODIS data to stratify finer Sentinel-2 reflectance and Sentinel-1 backscatter image features on a per-pixel basis. It incorporates texture features and employs a machine learning approach with over 300,000 samples. The eastern region of Ghana is stratified into seven seasonal strata using long-term MODIS data. Three years of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 original bands are composited into dry and wet seasonal features, from which spectral, polarimetric, and texture features are extracted. Field boundaries are digitized using PlanetScope images. The Random Forest classifier with 10-fold cross-validation and recursive feature elimination is used for feature selection and model building. ###\n\nP3.

The most important features were Sentinel-2 SWIR-based spectral features, followed by Sentinel-1 polarimetric (VV) and elevation features. Half of the 11 features were variance texture features, followed by spectral features. The Random Forest classifier produced a 0.78 AUC score with overall precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.96, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively.

The proposed CNN had the highest accuracy and generalization compared to BPNN, SVR, and GPR for estimating leaf C-ab and C-xc contents. The study provides a development strategy for CNN estimation models using one-dimensional hyperspectral reflectance at leaf scale, which could further promote the practical application of hyperspectral remote sensing in leaf C-ab and C-xc content estimation. ###",

        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to develop an algorithm that can distinguish between Ulm prolifera and Sargassum, two dominant species of macroalgae, from satellite images. This is important due to the occurrence of large-scale macroalgae blooms in the Yellow and East China Seas in 2017, which pose a challenge to the understanding and control of macroalgae disasters. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study analyzes the spectral difference between Ulm prolifera and Sargassum and evaluates the capability of several multispectral satellite missions to distinguish between them. The authors compare the reflectance characteristics of Ulm prolifera and Sargassum in different water conditions and assess the performance of different satellite instruments such as Landsat 8 OLI, HuanJing-1 CCD, Aqua MODIS, Sentinel 2 MSI, and GaoFen-1 WFV. Based on the spectral difference analysis, the authors propose a random forest-based algorithm to distinguish Ulm prolifera and Sargassum from GF-1 WFV images. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The results show that the reflectance peak in the visible wavelength is consistently around 550 nm for Ulm prolifera, regardless of whether it is floating in clear open water or turbid nearshore water. On the other hand, the reflectance characteristics of Sargassum floating in clear and turbid water are significantly different due to the submerged nature of most of its body. Among the satellite instruments evaluated, GaoFen-1 WFV is found to be the most effective in capturing the spectral difference between Ulm prolifera and Sargassum. The proposed random forest-based algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 97.6% in distinguishing Ulm prolifera and Sargassum from GF-1 WFV images, except when they are mixed together. The algorithm is considered more robust than existing methods as it allows for the inclusion of more Sargassum samples from different ocean regions and avoids negative effects caused by threshold selection. The algorithm is proven effective in distinguishing Ulm prolifera and Sargassum in the Yellow and East China Seas and detecting Sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean. It can be applied to research on macroalgae traceability, competition, and succession in different ocean regions with similar environments. ###",
        "Output": "The distinguishing results in the related research were obtained using two random forests. The first random forest (RF1) was constructed using specific spectral indices to distinguish seawater and floating macroalgae. The second random forest (RF2) was constructed using additional spectral indices to further divide the macroalgae into Ulva prolifera and Sargassum. The algorithm was evaluated using subgraphs extracted from satellite images, resulting in an overall accuracy of 97.6% and a kappa coefficient of 0.96."

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to compare the prediction accuracy of cognitive function using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data and basic blood test data, as well as to determine the impact of adding both types of data to the input layer. The study aimed to assess whether there were differences in prediction accuracy between linear models and non-linear models. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study used a linear regression model (LR) for the linear model and random forest (RF) and deep neural network (DNN) for the non-linear model. The researchers studied 250 participants with a mean age of 73.3 +/- 12.6 years. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Time-resolved NIRS (TNIRS) was used to measure hemoglobin concentrations and optical pathlength in the bilateral prefrontal cortices. A basic blood test was also performed on the same day. Prediction accuracies were evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study found that the DNN-based prediction using TNIRS data had lower MAE and MAPE compared to the prediction using blood test data. The difference in MAPE between TNIRS and blood test data was only 0.3%. Adding TNIRS data to the blood test data in the input layer improved MAPE by 1.0% compared to using blood test data alone. However, the use of blood test data alone exhibited a prediction accuracy of 81.8% sensitivity and 91.3% specificity. Based on these findings and the benefits of using blood test data (low cost and large-scale screening possible), the researchers concluded that the DNN model using blood test data is still the most suitable for mass screening. ###",

Purpose: The purpose of the research was to investigate the impact of acquiring synchronized on-ground data and hyperspectral data in different phases of plants' phenological development on the classification results of an annual vine invasive alien plant species (IAPS). The study also aimed to assess the effect of the lack of synchronization between hyperspectral and on-ground data collection on the mapping results of the annual vine IAPS. Additionally, the research aimed to determine if multitemporal image fusion could improve the classification results of the annual vine IAPS. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The research focused on Echinocystis lobata, an annual vine species considered highly invasive in Europe. Hyperspectral data and on-ground reference data were collected in different phenological phases of the plant's development. The classification accuracy of the annual vine IAPS was assessed using F1 scores. The impact of synchronization between hyperspectral and on-ground data collection was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of classifications obtained synchronously and those obtained with mismatched temporal data. The potential improvement in classification accuracy through multitemporal image fusion was also examined. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The phenological phase in which the data is acquired was found to have a significant influence on the quality of the classification result for the annual vine IAPS. The period of flowering (summer) with the greatest coverage of the area with shoots was optimal for classification, resulting in an F1 classification accuracy of 0.87 +/- 0.04. The accuracy of classifications was lower for spring (F1 = 0.64 +/- 0.04) and autumn (F1 = 0.75 +/- 0.05). The lack of synchronization between hyperspectral and on-ground data collection led to a decrease in classification accuracy of up to 0.08. Multitemporal image fusion did not significantly improve the classification accuracy compared to classifications trained on images from a single phenological stage. The main conclusion is that mapping an annual vine IAPS using remote sensing and machine learning is possible and highly effective when the remote sensing and on-ground data are obtained in strict synchronization and the appropriate phenological phase. Further research is needed to explore the possibility of mapping Echinocystis lobata using multispectral or hyperspectral satellite data. ###",

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Methods: The researchers conducted experiments on 30 rats that were subjected to electrocution death, post-mortem electrocution, and control treatment. The heart tissue spectra of the rats were scanned using a spectrometer, and a total of 70 spectral feature wavelength points were extracted using a competitive adaptive re-weighting algorithm. A random forest model was established to identify the feature wavelength.

The particle swarm optimized support vector machine model with feature extraction was found to be the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 98.46%.

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

The purpose of the study is to assess how different surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) experimental methodologies and workflow parameters can potentially impact machine learning (ML) disease classification of clinical samples. The study focuses on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and aims to determine the accuracy of ML in classifying CVD samples using label-free SERS. ###\n\nP2. The methods used in the study involved coupling a label-free, broadband, Ag nanoparticle-based SERS platform with ML. Simulated clinical samples for CVD were created, containing randomized combinations of five key CVD biomarkers at clinically relevant concentrations in serum. Raman spectra obtained at three different wavelengths (532 nm, 633 nm, and 785 nm) from up to 300 unique samples were classified into physiological and pathological categories using two standard ML models. Different SERS substrate lots, sample volumes, sample sizes, and known variations in randomization and experimental handling were also considered. ###\n\nP3. The study concludes that label-free SERS coupled with ML can correctly classify randomized CVD samples with high accuracies of up to 90.0% at 532 nm using as few as 200 training samples. Spectra obtained at 532 nm produced the highest accuracies, and no significant increase in accuracy was achieved using multiwavelength SERS. However, the study also found that sample preparation and measurement methodologies strongly influence ML classification and could artificially increase classification accuracies by as much as 27%. Therefore, it is important to properly consider these factors when applying ML techniques for CVD classification in order to improve data set acquisition and practical application for future point-of-care testing in patients. ###",

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas. The study concludes that quantifying spatial autocorrelation in the data can help in deciding whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately. ###",

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of machine-learning algorithms, specifically light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), for retrieving chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations from satellite images obtained by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2. The study focused on inland and coastal waters in South Korea and aimed to assess the accuracy of the ML algorithms in estimating Chla in optically complex waters. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study utilized matchup data between MSI satellite images and near-concurrent in situ Chla measurements from December 2018 to April 2021. The remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) values of six single spectral bands and four two-band ratios were used as input features for the ML algorithms. The LGBM algorithm was found to exhibit the best performance among the ML algorithms, with an R2 value of 0.75, bias of -0.15, slope of 0.73, RMSE of 15.15 mg/m\u00b3, and MAE of 9.49 mg/m\u00b3. Post-hoc interpretations using Shapley additive explanations identified Rrs(704)/Rrs(665) as the most important feature, while Rrs(739)/Rrs(704) and Rrs(492)/Rrs(560) played auxiliary roles in Chla retrieval through interaction with Rrs(704)/Rrs(665). Spatial variations in Chla within and among lakes were also analyzed in relation to buffer land cover types at multiple scales. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The ML algorithms, particularly LGBM, showed overall reasonable accuracy in estimating Chla concentrations from MSI satellite images in optically complex waters. The study confirmed the validity of LGBM for retrieving MSI-derived Chla from lakes and estuaries, with the best performing feature being Rrs(704)/Rrs(665). The associations between modeled Chla and buffer land cover types, such as an increase in Chla concentration with an increase in percent forest and a decrease in percent agricultural area, were consistent with established ecological knowledge. The study can serve as a reference for evaluating the validity of complex ML models for inland water remote sensing. ###",

The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

The authors aim to achieve good recognition and classification of different animal's blood fluorescence spectra, which can have applications in medical examination, agriculture, and food safety testing. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The authors collected fluorescence spectra data of whole blood and red blood cell with different concentrations (1% and 3%). The original data was denoised using the neighborhood average method to reduce the impact of noise on feature extraction and classification. A new feature extraction method called Combination and Amplification method was proposed specifically for blood fluorescence spectra. A BP neural network classifier was established to perform the recognition and classification. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The Combination and Amplification feature extraction method, along with the BP neural network classifier, achieved good recognition and classification for different animal's blood fluorescence spectra. The test error was much less than the allowable variation. The technologies proposed in this study have potential applications in medical examination, agriculture, and food safety testing. ###",
