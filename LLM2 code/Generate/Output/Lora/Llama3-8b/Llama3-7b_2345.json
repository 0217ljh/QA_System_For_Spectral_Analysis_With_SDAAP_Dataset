The spectral ratio (SR) parametric regression model and the extreme learning machine (ELM) nonparametric regression model were evaluated using in situ SPM and spectral data. A SR fitting model using band3/band2 of the GF-1 WFV sensor was established to estimate the C-SPM value. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The SR parametric regression model and the ELM nonparametric regression model performed relatively better than other investigated models. The SR model achieved a high retrieval accuracy (R-2 = 0.901, RMSE = 8.22 mg/L) and effectively weakened the effects of external factors. The ELM model achieved a higher retrieval accuracy (R-2 = 0.903, RMSE = 8.05 mg/L) than other neural network-based algorithms. The C-SPM values in Poyang Lake had a spatial characteristic, with higher values in the northern waters than in the southern waters. The study demonstrates the applicability of GF-1 WFV sensors and recommends the ELM model for producing quantitative C-SPM maps. ###",

The preprocessing steps, including geometric, radiometric, and atmospheric corrections, were conducted to ensure data accuracy. A total of 122 bands with valid information were used for analysis, and various vegetation indices and NRI combinations were calculated to extract relevant information for mapping purposes.",
        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to analyze highly correlated, feature-rich datasets from hyperspectral remote sensing data using multiple statistical and machine-learning methods. The study aimed to compare the effect of filter-based feature selection methods on predictive performance and investigate the effect of multiple expert-based and data-driven feature sets derived from reflectance data. The study also aimed to model defoliation of trees as a function of reflectance and assess variable importance using permutation-based feature importance. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study used multiple statistical and machine-learning methods to analyze the datasets. The effect of filter-based feature selection methods on predictive performance was compared. Expert-based and data-driven feature sets derived from reflectance data were investigated. Defoliation of trees was modeled as a function of reflectance. Variable importance was assessed using permutation-based feature importance. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used and compared to other algorithms such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions. Ensemble filters were also evaluated. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm outperformed other algorithms such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions by at least three percentage points in terms of predictive performance. Certain combinations of feature sets showed small increases in predictive performance, while no substantial differences were observed between individual feature sets. Filter methods were found to achieve better predictive performances than using no feature selection in some combinations of learners and feature sets. Ensemble filters did not have a substantial impact on performance. The most important features were located around the red edge, and additional features in the near-infrared region (800-1000 nm) were also essential for achieving the overall best performances. Filter methods were found to be helpful in high-dimensional situations and improve the interpretation of feature effects in fitted models. However, more training data and replication in similar benchmarking studies are needed to generalize the results. ###",

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

The nighttime model with only infrared observations is also slightly better than the AHI operational product but may tend to overestimate cloudy pixels.

        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of the research is to propose a terahertz spectrum recognition method based on WGAN (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks) to address the challenge of classifying terahertz spectral data due to the difficulty in collecting multi-material equilibrium spectral data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The researchers used three types of maltose compounds with similar characteristics spectra for verification. They normalized the spectral data using S-G filtering and cubic spline interpolation. They then constructed a WGAN model to expand the unbalanced terahertz spectral data and bring it to class equilibrium. The generated data from WGAN was mixed with real data and trained using a support vector machine (SVM). They compared WGAN with traditional methods for processing unbalanced data sets (FWSVM and COPY). ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The experimental results showed that the generated data from WGAN effectively mapped the distribution of real data. Mixing the generated data with real data improved the accuracy of identifying unbalanced spectral data. The SVM model trained using the extended WGAN data set solved the problem of small sample data biased towards large sample data. The accuracy of the test set after using WGAN reached 91.54%. The method was also effective in dealing with different imbalances in actual work. ###",
