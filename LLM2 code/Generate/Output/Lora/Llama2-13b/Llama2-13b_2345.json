This method aims to improve the reliability and real-time performance of existing methods and establish a prediction model for the carbon content of steelmaking endpoint. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The proposed method combines window competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (WCARS) with an iterative successive projection algorithm (ISPA) to select characteristic wavelengths. The spectral data is divided along the wavelength direction in the window, and CARS is used to select the feature window band. The iterative selection is combined with a traditional successive projection algorithm to select the characteristic wavelengths through repeated iteration. Support vector machine regression (SVR) is then used to establish the carbon content prediction model. The experimental sample consists of 363 sets of spectral data, which are preprocessed using Savitzky-Golay smoothing. The input of the SVR model is 10 characteristic wavelength data selected by WCARS-ISPA, and the output is carbon content. The training set and test set are divided using the Kennard-Stone algorithm. The average prediction error, hit ratio, and running time are used as evaluation indexes. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The results of the study show that the proposed WCARS-ISPA method for extracting characteristic spectral wavelengths has the lowest prediction error and the highest hit ratio compared to other feature selection methods.

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to develop an automatic filtering system for very noisy and non-soil spectra obtained during online vis-NIR measurements. ###\n\nP2. Methods: Two databases were created using soil and non-soil spectra obtained from online vis-NIR measurements in four commercial fields. Similarity algorithms (Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Euclidian distance, cosine distance, and principal component analysis) and machine learning algorithms (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbors) were evaluated and compared for spectra filtering using the two databases. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The similarity algorithms were not successful in classifying spectra into soil and non-soil classes. However, the machine learning algorithms provided high classification accuracies for both databases. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm achieved the best classification result of 98.5% in cross-validation and 98.6% in independent validation for the former database. The support vector machine algorithm with a Gaussian kernel achieved the best result of 81.4% in cross-validation and 82.03% in independent validation for the latter database. The best performing model was used to build a cleaning function for automatic pre-processing and classification of spectra into soil or non-soil classes. This automatic spectrum filtering system saves time and ensures only high-quality spectra are used for accurate online prediction of soil properties. ###",

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to develop a new strategy for label-free diagnosis of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) using serum-based Raman spectroscopy. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The researchers investigated the Raman spectral characteristics of serum in rats at different time points (3 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h) after mild and moderate bTBIs. They compared the position and intensity of Raman characteristic peaks in the range of 800-3000 cm-1 with a control group. Additionally, they used principal component analysis and four machine learning algorithms (quadratic discriminant analysis, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, neural network) to automatically classify the control group and different bTBI groups. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study found that the Raman characteristic peaks in the serum of rats with bTBI showed significant differences in both position and intensity compared to the control group. This suggests that the content, structure, and interaction of biomolecules in the serum were altered after blast exposure, providing insights into the neurological syndromes caused by bTBI. The combination of principal component analysis and machine learning algorithms achieved high classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, indicating the potential of this method for high-sensitive, rapid, and label-free diagnosis of bTBI. ###",

        "Output": "The study compares the remote sensing spectral profiles of Opuntia stricta and shrubs by analyzing hyperspectral data cubes simulated using a Radiative Transfer Model (PROSAIL). The implications of this comparison for accurate classification include the potential for distinguishing between different plant types based on their unique spectral signatures, which can improve the accuracy of classification models in remote sensing applications.",
        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas. The study concludes that quantifying spatial autocorrelation in the data can help in deciding whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately. ###",

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Purpose: The primary purpose of this study is to obtain shallow wetland bathymetry utilizing spectral reflections obtained at different water depths by field study and satellite images. ###\n\nP2. Methods: Machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), were used in this study.

The study aimed to develop a prediction pipeline using deep learning techniques that could be used as part of routine milk recording to help farmers make early management decisions on potential reactor cows and slow the spread of bTB. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study collected bovine tuberculosis data from over 40,500 bTB herd breakdowns as part of the national bTB testing program for Scotland, England, and Wales. Individual cow life history data, including births, movements, and deaths, were also available. The MIR spectral data of individual cows were collected as part of monthly routine milk recording and matched to their bTB status on the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin test date. Deep learning techniques, specifically deep convolutional neural networks, were used to train artificial neural networks and develop a prediction pipeline. The MIR spectra were converted to 53 x 20-pixel PNG images and used to train the network. Additional training data were synthesized using the synthetic minority over sampling technique to balance data in each class. The accuracy, validation loss, sensitivity, and specificity of the prediction pipeline were evaluated. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The deep convolutional neural networks resulted in a bTB prediction accuracy of 71% after training for 278 epochs. When synthesized data were included during training, the accuracy increased to 95% after 295 epochs. The validation loss was minimized to 0.26 with the inclusion of synthesized data. The sensitivity and specificity also increased when synthesized data were included during training. The study believes this to be the first of its kind to predict bTB status from milk MIR spectral data and the first to use milk MIR spectral data to predict a disease phenotype. The automated prediction of bTB status at routine milk recording could provide farmers with a robust tool to make early management decisions on potential reactor cows and help slow the spread of bTB. ###",

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate different spectral indices for estimating plant leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and to determine the most effective method for estimating LCC across a wide range of plant species and measurement conditions. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study used multiangular hyperspectral reflection data from 706 leaves of ten plant species to evaluate several popular spectral indices for estimating LCC. The modified difference ratio index (MDRI) was found to have the strongest linear relationship with LCC. A regression algorithm was then used to estimate LCC in other datasets from different regions across the globe. Validation results from 2024 leaves of 114 plant species were compared with machine learning techniques and the PROSPECT model. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study concluded that the linear algorithm derived from the MDRI was the most effective method for estimating LCC across a wide range of plant species and measurement conditions. The MDRI did not require parameterization for each plant species and had the potential to estimate LCC using a simple handheld laboratory or field instrument at any arbitrary direction. The generality of the approach made it convenient for botanical and ecological studies that required accurate LCC estimates under different measurement conditions. ###",

        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of a spectral index, called the angle insensitive nitrogen index (AINI), to estimate aerial nitrogen concentration (ANC) in cotton under different observation zenith angles (VZAs). The study aimed to optimize the spectral band with weight for ANC that is insensitive to VZA and to assess the performance of ANC estimation in different directions of remote sensing observations. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study used hyperspectral remote sensing techniques to estimate canopy nitrogen content in cotton. The Relief-F method was employed to select the best spectral band with weight for ANC that is insensitive to VZA. The AINI was calculated using the expression (R-530 - R-704)/(R-1412 + R-704). The correlation between the spectral index and ANC was analyzed under different VZAs. The ANC estimation model of the optimal indices AINI and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) was combined with the random forest (RF) machine learning method. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study found that the AINI index can estimate cotton ANC under different VZAs. The correlation between the spectral index and ANC was stronger than the correlation between off-nadir observations. The correlation coefficients between PRI, AINI, and ANC were highest when VZA was -20 degrees and -50 degrees. AINI had the best correlation with ANC under different VZAs, and the performance of ANC in the backscatter direction was estimated to be better than that in the forward-scatter direction. The combination of the ANC estimation model using AINI and PRI with the RF machine learning method achieved high accuracy, with an R-2 value of 0.98 and RMSE of 0.590. The findings suggest that multi-angle observations and the use of the backscattered direction can improve crop nutrient estimation and the use of ground-based and satellite sensors. ###",

The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

        "Output": "The spatial distribution of different-salinized soil content varies in different two-dimensional feature spaces when using remote sensing spectrum for assessing soil salinity in the Werigan-Kuqa region. This variation is influenced by factors such as vegetation cover, soil moisture levels, and seasonal changes, leading to different correlations between spectral indices and observed salinity concentrations in the area. The use of Random Forest (RF) modeling has shown to provide more robust estimations of soil properties compared to other methods in highly vegetation-covered croplands.",
        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to assess the potential of machine learning methods, specifically random forest (RF) regression model, for predicting and mapping soil salinity in highly vegetated and slightly salt-affected croplands. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The researchers constructed a random forest (RF) regression model using measured soil salinity and spectral indices from remote sensing data (Landsat 8 OLI and MODIS). The model was evaluated under different soil salinity conditions and with different resolutions of imagery data to compare it with the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The results showed that the RF model achieved higher accuracy estimation compared to the MARS model, especially in highly vegetated croplands with poor correlations between soil salinity and spectral indices. The RF model had a cross-validation determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.86, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.83, and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 2.7, while the MARS model had R-2 of 0.81, RMSE of 4.8, and RPD of 1.96. The RF model also produced acceptable mapping accuracy for digital soil salinity mapping of slightly and moderately salt-affected croplands. ###",
