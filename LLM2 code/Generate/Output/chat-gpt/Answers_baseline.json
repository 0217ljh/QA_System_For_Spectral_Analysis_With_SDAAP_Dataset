        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to develop an automatic filtering system for very noisy and non-soil spectra obtained during online vis-NIR measurements. ###\n\nP2. Methods: Two databases were created using soil and non-soil spectra obtained from online vis-NIR measurements in four commercial fields. Similarity algorithms (Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, Euclidian distance, cosine distance, and principal component analysis) and machine learning algorithms (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbors) were evaluated and compared for spectra filtering using the two databases. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The similarity algorithms were not successful in classifying spectra into soil and non-soil classes. However, the machine learning algorithms provided high classification accuracies for both databases. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm achieved the best classification result of 98.5% in cross-validation and 98.6% in independent validation for the former database. The support vector machine algorithm with a Gaussian kernel achieved the best result of 81.4% in cross-validation and 82.03% in independent validation for the latter database. The best performing model was used to build a cleaning function for automatic pre-processing and classification of spectra into soil or non-soil classes. This automatic spectrum filtering system saves time and ensures only high-quality spectra are used for accurate online prediction of soil properties. ###",

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed.

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas.

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to analyze highly correlated, feature-rich datasets from hyperspectral remote sensing data using multiple statistical and machine-learning methods. The study aimed to compare the effect of filter-based feature selection methods on predictive performance and investigate the effect of multiple expert-based and data-driven feature sets derived from reflectance data. The study also aimed to model defoliation of trees as a function of reflectance and assess variable importance using permutation-based feature importance. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study used multiple statistical and machine-learning methods to analyze the datasets. The effect of filter-based feature selection methods on predictive performance was compared. Expert-based and data-driven feature sets derived from reflectance data were investigated. Defoliation of trees was modeled as a function of reflectance. Variable importance was assessed using permutation-based feature importance. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used and compared to other algorithms such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions. Ensemble filters were also evaluated. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm outperformed other algorithms such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions by at least three percentage points in terms of predictive performance. Certain combinations of feature sets showed small increases in predictive performance, while no substantial differences were observed between individual feature sets. Filter methods were found to achieve better predictive performances than using no feature selection in some combinations of learners and feature sets. Ensemble filters did not have a substantial impact on performance. The most important features were located around the red edge, and additional features in the near-infrared region (800-1000 nm) were also essential for achieving the overall best performances. Filter methods were found to be helpful in high-dimensional situations and improve the interpretation of feature effects in fitted models. However, more training data and replication in similar benchmarking studies are needed to generalize the results. ###",

The deep spectral features were obtained using WT-SAE with db5 as the wavelet basis function. Support vector machine regression (SVR) was used for regression modeling. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The best prediction performances for detecting lead concentration in lettuce leaves were obtained using the raw data set. The results showed a coefficient of determination for calibration (R-c(2)) of 0.9911, root mean square error for calibration (RMSEC) of 0.05187, coefficient of determination for prediction (R-p(2)) of 0.9590, root mean square error for prediction (RMSEP) of 0.05587, and residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 3.251 using db5 as the wavelet basis function with wavelet fifth layer decomposition. The study concluded that WT-SAE can effectively select optimal deep spectral features and that Vis-NIR hyperspectral imaging has great potential for detecting lead content in lettuce leaves. ###",
        "Output": "The deep learning based regression method consisting of WT and stacked auto-encoders (WT-SAE) in the related study contributes to the detection of Pb concentration in lettuce leaf by decomposing spectral data using WT for multi-scale transform and obtaining deep spectral features with SAE algorithm at different wavelet decomposition layers. This method helps process the large distribution and information of spectral data for accurate Pb concentration prediction.",

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of machine learning algorithms based on spectral reflectance and plant height with traditional linear regression in predicting wheat grain yield and protein content. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study used low-cost multispectral cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles to collect spectral reflectance data. Machine learning algorithms, such as random forest and artificial neural network, were used to analyze the data and predict crop characteristics. Linear regression based on vegetation indices was also used for comparison. The performance of these models in predicting grain yield and protein content was assessed using root-mean-square error (RMSE). ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The machine learning approaches based on spectral reflectance did not improve the accuracy of grain yield prediction, but showed potential for predicting protein content. The linear regression model based on a 2-band enhanced vegetation index had an RMSE of 972 kg ha(-1) for predicting yield, while the random forest model based on reflectance had an RMSE of 1.07% for predicting protein content. The study also found a linear correlation between reflectance and total biomass, indicating a relationship between reflectance and grain yield. However, the relationship between grain yield and protein content was nonlinear, which may explain the higher performance of machine learning approaches in predicting protein content. The study suggests that this relationship may vary depending on the environment and agronomic practices, and further research is needed to assess its variability and impact on model generality. ###",

Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation.

Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed.

        "Knowledge": "P1. Purpose: The purpose of the research was to determine the accuracy of soil organic matter (OM) prediction across varying soil volumetric water content (VWC) using a planter-mounted optical sensor and different combinations of reflectance bands within the visible and near infrared (VNIR) spectrum. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The researchers collected data from 90 soils across Missouri and Illinois using a Precision Planting SmartFirmer and a benchtop spectrometer. The SmartFirmer OM was derived through an internal algorithm, while spectral pre-processing and machine learning were used for OM prediction in all approaches that used reflectance from the benchtop spectrometer. Three modeling approaches were used to analyze the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The SmartFirmer OM predictions were affected by soil VWC, with predicted OM decreasing as VWC increased. The modeling approaches using the benchtop spectrometer showed that a continuous spectrum (400-1,500 nm) improved performance compared to a discrete waveband approach. Including the entire VNIR region (400-2,500 nm) resulted in the best predictive capability. However, using reflectance from 400 to 1,500 nm along with spectral pre-processing and machine learning may be an acceptable and cost-effective method for estimating OM. These findings contribute to the improvement of commercially available proximal sensors for monitoring soil carbon stocks, assessing soil health, and other precision agriculture applications. ###",
        "Output": "The SmartFirmer can be utilized in soil organic matter prediction by providing real-time OM predictions based on reflectance data collected from specific wavelength bands. Insights gained from using this spectral detection method include evaluating the 1:1 relationship between SmartFirmer OM and laboratory-measured OM at different VWC levels, assessing prediction errors, and comparing regression models based on R2 and RMSE values. Additionally, the SmartFirmer allows for the direct output of OM from the sensor system, providing a convenient and efficient method for soil organic matter prediction in agricultural research.",

Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to address the deficiencies in visible-near infrared spectral identification of coal gangue under different working conditions by employing multiple algorithms to construct local and global recognition models and conducting analysis. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The paper simulates five different working conditions in the laboratory, including different detection angles, illumination angles, detection distances, coal powder content, and moisture content. Spectral data of coal and gangue samples are collected. Global and local datasets are constructed, derived from all levels and single levels under certain working conditions. Machine learning algorithms such as Lightgbm and 1DCNN are used to train local and global models for sample identification. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The results of the experiment show that there are variations in the sample spectra and recognition accuracy based on different working conditions. The local model exhibits lower recognition accuracy and inadequate robustness for other level samples under the same working condition. The global model, particularly the Lightgbm global model, is more robust and practical, achieving higher or equal recognition accuracy for local data compared to the local model. The Lightgbm global model has an average F1-score of 99.34% and 97.9% for local and global datasets, respectively, with fast training and recognition times. It can accurately identify coal and gangue in various working conditions, making it a reliable solution. ###",

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas. The study concludes that quantifying spatial autocorrelation in the data can help in deciding whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately. ###",

Methods: A total of 540 samples, including raw duck blood tofu (DBT), cow blood-based gel (CBG), pig blood-based gel (PBG), and adulterated DBT with CBG and PBG, were used. The protein, fat, total sugar, and 16 kinds of amino acids were measured to validate the difference in basic organic matters among EABFs according to species.

Methods: The researchers conducted field experiments over two consecutive years, varying irrigation times and using seven different wheat varieties. They collected canopy spectra reflectance and leaf water content (LWC) data. They used the correlation coefficient method (CA) and x-Loading weight method (x-Lw) to extract characteristic bands related to LWC. They employed five modeling methods, including spectral index and four other methods (PLSR, RFR, ERT, and KNN), to construct LWC estimation models based on the characteristic bands. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study found that the canopy spectral reflectance increased with the increase of irrigation times, particularly in the near-infrared band. The newly developed differential spectral index DVI (R1185, R1307) had higher prediction accuracy than existing spectral indexes. The models based on characteristic bands had comparable accuracy to the full spectrum-based models. The ERT-x-Lw model performed the best among the models, and the accuracy of the LWC estimation model constructed by ERT-x-Lw was higher than that of DVI (R1185, R1307).

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to assess the use of cloud-based artificial intelligence to detect early indicators of water stress in container-grown ornamental shrub species. The goal is to optimize water allocation in real-time and address the critical need for sustainable water use in agriculture. ###\n\nP2. Methods: Near-infrared images of plants in no, low-, and high-water stress conditions were collected using modified cameras deployed via a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) at an altitude of 30 meters. These images were then split into four-fold cross-validation sets and used to train models through IBM Watson's Visual Recognition service. The models were trained with a small sample size of 36 plants and 150 images, with low image resolution. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: Despite the constraints of small sample size and low image resolution, the cloud-based artificial intelligence models generated by IBM Watson were able to detect indicators of water stress after 48 hours of water deprivation in four out of five species tested. Two models were also able to detect indicators of water stress after only 24 hours, achieving a high average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9884. The ease of pre-processing, minimal training data required, and outsourced computation make cloud-based artificial intelligence services an attractive tool for agriculture analytics. This technology, combined with other tools like sUAS and spectral imaging, can help crop producers identify deficient irrigation strategies and intervene before crop value is diminished. When implemented at scale, these frameworks can drive responsive irrigation systems that monitor crop status in real-time and maximize sustainable water use. ###",

In the context of detecting early indicators of water stress in container-grown ornamental shrub species using visible and NIR remote sensing spectrum, CNNs can identify features that may not be easily discernible to traditional machine vision models, leading to more accurate and efficient detection of water stress.",

Methods: The researchers trained a CNN model on a large MIR soil spectral library compiled by the National Soil Survey Center of the United States Department of Agriculture.

The study aimed to bridge the gap between standard polymers in the laboratory and household microplastics in the soil environment. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The researchers spiked soil samples with two standard polymers (polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene) and their additive-containing household microplastics. They prepared two sets of standard samples and two sets of household samples with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10%. Nine preprocessing methods and three machine learning algorithms were used to develop the quantification methods. Models were constructed using the training sets from the standard sample sets. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The terahertz method (Wdenosie_PLSR) showed a smaller increase in prediction error (RMSE) when transferred to household samples compared to the NIR method. The terahertz method had a detection limit of around 1.12%, while the NIR method had a detection limit of around 3.24%. The results suggest that the terahertz method is not only more accurate but also demonstrates stronger generalizability in bridging the gap between standard polymers and household microplastics. The researchers also proposed using MMD heatmap for diagnosing spectral preprocessing methods to further improve method efficiency. ###",

Methods: The study uses high-resolution small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) information to develop two feature-extraction approaches: a point-cloud-based approach (Full Approach) and a raster-based approach (Fast Approach). Three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Relevance Vector Machine) and hybrid ML schemes based on these algorithms are considered. The accuracy and efficiency of the models are evaluated through visual and statistical assessments. The generated LAI products are then used in the quantification of energy balance using the two-source energy balance Priestley-Taylor version (TSEB-PT) model and EC tower data. Sensitivity analysis is performed by regenerating LAI maps based on the generated LAI map to assess the impact of LAI uncertainty on energy balance components. ###\n\nP3.

The generated LAI products show excellent estimation of net radiation and latent heat flux, good estimation of surface heat flux, and poor estimation of sensible heat flux. The sensitivity analysis reveals that LAI uncertainty has a major impact on surface heat flux, followed by evapotranspiration partitioning, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and net radiation.

The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas. The study concludes that quantifying spatial autocorrelation in the data can help in deciding whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately. ###",

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models, in the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation. The study also aims to determine whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately based on the quantification of spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP2. Methods: The study uses data from remote sensing with finer spectral and spatial resolution. Empirical models are trained with a limited number of observations compared to the number of wavelengths due to the time-consuming and difficult nature of collecting ground reference points for validation. Machine learning regression is used to select the most informative wavelengths and transform them into latent variables to avoid multicollinearity. Models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate are also employed. The study quantifies spatial autocorrelation in the data. ###\n\nP3. Conclusions: The study finds that models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate exhibit higher prediction accuracy than machine learning regression models when significant spatial autocorrelation is observed. However, these models require a drastic reduction in the number of hyperspectral bands included and cannot be directly extrapolated to new, unobserved locations in other areas. The study concludes that quantifying spatial autocorrelation in the data can help in deciding whether the spatial and spectral dimensions should be modeled together or separately. ###",
        "Output": "LiDAR and radar data from UAVs can be integrated into the pavement distress detection process using remote sensing spectrum by utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) and Partial Least Squared Regression (PLSR) to model the hyperspectral data. These algorithms can handle highly dimensional data and multicollinearity effectively. Additionally, a spatial model can be developed by representing the sampling locations as a continuous Gaussian Field (GF) using a mesh obtained through a constrained Delaunay triangulation. This spatial dependency structure can help in accurately detecting and assessing pavement distress using LiDAR and radar data collected by UAVs.",
