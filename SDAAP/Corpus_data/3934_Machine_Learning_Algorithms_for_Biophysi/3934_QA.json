        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to classify lake observations into four biophysical classes was the chlorophyll-a concentration (chla). This metric can go as far as distinguishing between lakes with good or high transparency despite the presence of optically active substances, with chlorophyll being the dominating substance in this class."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers tested six different machine learning algorithms that use spectral features of lakes as input. They then compared the results of these algorithms to determine which one yielded the most accurate classification of lake observations into the four biophysical classes: Clear, Moderate, Chla-dominated, and Turbid. After evaluating the performance of each algorithm, the researchers found that the random forest classifiers provided the most accurate results."
