        "Output": "Yes, LIBS technology combined with stoichiometry can accurately analyze the heavy metal Cu in Angelica sinensis and Scutellaria baicalensis. The past study used the standard curve method and internal standard method for quantitative analysis of Cu in these medicinal materials. However, it was found that these traditional quantitative analysis methods had large errors.\n\nTo improve the quantitative analysis performance of LIBS, the past study also employed partial least squares (PLS) and back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) in combination with LIBS and stoichiometry. The results showed that the results calculated by BP-ANN were closer to the real value, followed by the PLS method. This indicates that the combination of LIBS technology and machine learning methods can provide more accurate and rapid analysis of heavy metals in traditional Chinese medicinal materials.\n\nIn comparison to traditional quantitative analysis methods, LIBS technology combined with machine learning methods offers several advantages. It provides a faster analysis process, allowing for rapid screening of heavy metal content in TCMM. Additionally, the results obtained through LIBS technology combined with machine learning methods are more accurate, as demonstrated by the smaller errors compared to the traditional methods. Therefore, the combination of LIBS technology and machine learning methods is a promising approach for the accurate"
