        "Output": "Yes, based on the study's conclusions, the linear empirical models (log-ratio model and log-linear model) are not considered superior to traditional methods in deriving water depths in shallow nearshore waters from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images. The study found that a non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning approach provided the best performance and produced more accurate bathymetry maps compared to the traditional empirical models."
