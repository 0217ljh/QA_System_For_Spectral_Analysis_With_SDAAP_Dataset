The cGAN model showed better performance compared to the baseline model and the operational product of PERSIANN-CCS, even with the application of the IR channel solely as input. The cGAN model was able to capture the relationship between satellite information and precipitation, even in locations covered with warm clouds, showing significant performance improvement."

        "Output": "The role of the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) in the precipitation estimation framework presented in the related paper is to act as a regressor for predicting precipitation estimates. The FCN is trained using the non-saturating conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss terms. It is designed to learn the complex distribution of precipitation in the observed data and generate more accurate results."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed framework improves the accuracy of precipitation estimates compared to traditional methods by leveraging advances in satellite remote sensing and Deep Learning techniques. It takes advantage of the improvements in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the GOES-16 platform, along with elevation information, to enhance the estimation of precipitation.\n\nThe framework begins by deriving a Rain/No Rain (R/NR) binary mask through pixel classification. It then applies regression to estimate the amount of rainfall for the rainy pixels. A Fully Convolutional Network is used as a regressor to predict precipitation estimates. The network is trained using the non-saturating conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss terms.\n\nBy utilizing Deep Learning techniques, the framework is able to better learn the complex distribution of precipitation in the observed data. This leads to improved accuracy in both the R/NR classification and real-valued precipitation estimates. The accuracy of the framework is evaluated using common verification metrics such as Probability Of Detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), Critical Success Index (CSI), Bias, Correlation, and MSE."
