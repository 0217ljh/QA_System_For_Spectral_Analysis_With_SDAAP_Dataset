        "Output": "The study used prefrontal functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure hemoglobin concentrations in the brains of drug users. This technique allows researchers to assess changes in brain activity by measuring the levels of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin.\n\nIn addition, the study employed convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify different functional areas of the prefrontal cortex. CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly effective in analyzing visual data. In the study, the CNN was trained to classify eight specific areas of the prefrontal cortex, as well as the entire prefrontal area.\n\nBy combining fNIRS measurements with CNN classification, the researchers were able to analyze and compare the brain activity patterns of drug users. They examined the classification accuracy of the different functional areas in drug users on methamphetamine, heroin, and mixed drugs. The study aimed to identify any differences in brain activity between the three types of drug users and determine the specific areas of the prefrontal cortex that were affected by drug addiction."

        "Output": "The use of prefrontal functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) contributes to the investigation of brain functional changes in drug users compared to traditional methods in several ways.\n\nFirstly, prefrontal fNIRS allows for non-invasive measurement of hemoglobin concentrations in the brain, providing valuable information about brain activity and functional changes. This technique can specifically target the prefrontal cortex, which is known to be involved in addiction and decision-making processes.\n\nBy collecting hemoglobin concentration data from drug users, researchers can analyze the effects of different types of addictive drugs on brain function. In the given study, the hemoglobin concentrations of drug users on methamphetamine, heroin, and mixed drugs were collected using prefrontal fNIRS.\n\nSecondly, the collected data can be analyzed using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are a type of deep learning algorithm. CNNs are particularly effective in analyzing complex patterns and features in large datasets, making them well-suited for analyzing brain imaging data.\n\nIn the study mentioned, CNNs were designed to classify eight specific brain regions (Brodmann areas) as well as the entire prefrontal area. By training the CNNs on the collected data, researchers were able to classify and"
