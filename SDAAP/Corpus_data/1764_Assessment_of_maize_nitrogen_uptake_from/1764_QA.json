        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the correlation between canopy nitrogen content (CNC) and plant nitrogen uptake (PNU) is the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in PNU that can be explained by CNC. In this study, the R-2 values for CNC and PNU were found to be 0.82 and 0.80, respectively. \n\nThe R-2 value can provide valuable information about the strength and direction of the relationship between CNC and PNU. However, it is important to note that the R-2 value alone cannot fully evaluate the relationship. Other factors such as the sample size, the quality of the data, and the specific context of the study should also be considered when interpreting the relationship between CNC and PNU."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning regression algorithms were used in the hybrid approach to estimate the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and canopy nitrogen content (CNC) from synthetic PRISMA data. The radiative transfer model PROSAIL-PRO was combined with several machine learning regression algorithms. These algorithms were trained using the simulated PRISMA-like data generated from two images acquired by the airborne sensor HyPlant during a campaign in Grosseto, Italy in 2018. The algorithms were then used to predict the CCC and CNC values from the PRISMA data. The best performing machine learning algorithms were selected based on their accuracy in estimating CCC and CNC."
