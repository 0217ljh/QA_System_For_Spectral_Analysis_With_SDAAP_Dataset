        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral imaging, variable selection method, and machine-learning classifiers can be used to achieve presymptomatic detection of tobacco disease with higher accuracy compared to traditional methods. The study found that using hyperspectral imaging combined with the variable selection method and machine-learning classifiers resulted in classification accuracies above 80% for detecting and classifying disease stages. The chemometric models with data fusion, which incorporated both effective wavelengths (EWs) and texture features, achieved even better results with accuracies up to 95%. This indicates that these advanced techniques have the potential to accurately identify infected leaves in a shorter period of time compared to traditional methods that rely on visible symptoms of infection."
