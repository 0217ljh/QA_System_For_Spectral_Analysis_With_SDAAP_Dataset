        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the spectral fusion models is the percentage accuracy. In this case, the accuracy of the spectral fusion model PCA-SVM is reported to be 83.48%. \n\nThis metric can go a long way in improving the detection accuracy as it indicates the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. By achieving a higher accuracy, the spectral fusion model is able to more accurately distinguish between thyroid dysfunction and normal serum samples. This can lead to more reliable and efficient screening of thyroid dysfunction."

The proposal improves detection accuracy and obtains more spectral features, indicating greater differences between thyroid dysfunction and normal serum samples. The accuracy of spectral fusion is higher than the accuracy of single spectrum in five classifiers. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of spectral fusion in the range of 2000 to 2500cm(-1) greatly improves the sample measure speed and data analysis speed compared to analyzing the full spectra. Therefore, the spectral fusion technique shows great potential for the screening of thyroid dysfunction."
