        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed fusion-based structure for weed detection in visible and thermal images of paddy fields, using the ELM with a late fusion structure and GA, is expected to be more effective in reducing the overuse of herbicides compared to traditional methods. \n\nBy accurately targeting weeds through machine vision-based techniques, the automatic spraying system can specifically target areas where weeds are present, minimizing the need for herbicide application on the entire field. This targeted approach helps in reducing the overuse of herbicides, as only the necessary areas are treated.\n\nThe use of thermal images in addition to visible images allows for a more comprehensive and accurate detection of weeds. The proposed fusion-based structure combines multiple types of features, including morphological, spectral, textural, and thermal features, to create a robust weed detection system. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used for optimized feature selection, further enhancing the accuracy of the system.\n\nThe best results obtained by the ELM with a late fusion structure and GA, with an accuracy of 98.08%, indicate the effectiveness of this approach in accurately detecting weeds. This high accuracy ensures that herbicides are only applied where weeds are present, reducing the overall usage and minimizing the environmental impact."
