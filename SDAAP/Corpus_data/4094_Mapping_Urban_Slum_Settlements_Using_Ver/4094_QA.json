        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the accuracy of the classification is the overall accuracy. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified slum and nonslum settlements in relation to the total number of settlements. \n\nThe overall accuracy can provide a general assessment of the classification performance."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of land boundary data in the proposed method is to assist in obtaining homogenous neighborhoods (HNs). The VHR imagery and land boundary layer are used together to identify and delineate these HNs, which are then classified into slum and nonslum settlements using machine learning techniques. The land boundary data helps in defining the boundaries of the neighborhoods and provides additional spatial information that aids in accurately mapping slum settlements."
