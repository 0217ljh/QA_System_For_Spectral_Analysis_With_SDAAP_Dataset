        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the models is the determination coefficient (R-p(2)), the root-mean-square error (RMSEP), and the residual prediction deviation (RPD). These metrics provide a measure of how well the models are able to predict the soil composition contents.\n\nIn terms of how far this metric can go in predicting soil composition contents, it indicates the level of accuracy and precision achieved by the models. A higher determination coefficient (R-p(2)) indicates a stronger correlation between the predicted values and the actual values of the soil composition contents. A lower root-mean-square error (RMSEP) suggests that the predicted values are closer to the actual values, indicating a higher level of accuracy. The residual prediction deviation (RPD) provides information about the precision of the predictions, with a higher RPD indicating a more precise estimation.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the models with KPCA dimension reduction (KPCA-RF and KPCA-SVM) have higher determination coefficients, lower root-mean-square errors, and higher residual prediction deviations compared to the models without KPCA dimension reduction (RF and SVM). This suggests that the machine learning models combined with KPCA are more accurate and precise in predicting the soil composition contents. However, the specific range or extent"

The results of the study show that the determination coefficients and residual prediction deviation for the prediction samples of the KPCA-RF model are higher than those of the RF model for estimating soil OM content. Similarly, the accuracy of the KPCA-RF model for estimating soil Fe and Zn contents is also higher. The same trend is observed for the KPCA-SVM model. Therefore, the machine learning models combined with KPCA are more promising and effective in the quantitative inversion of soil composition contents."
