        "Output": "In the related study, three different diversity indices were chosen to characterize forest tree species diversity. These indices are Simpson (lambda), Shannon (H '), and Pielou (J '). These metrics can provide a quantitative measure of diversity by considering the richness and evenness of species within a forest area."

        "Output": "The researchers assessed the importance of various variables in estimating forest tree species diversity by using two methods: Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT). They considered a total of 68 variables, including monthly spectral bands, vegetation indices, foliage height diversity (FHD), and plant area index (PAI) of both growing and non-growing seasons. The MDG and BRT methods helped determine the significance of these variables in accurately quantifying forest diversity."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study demonstrated the accuracy of GEDI LiDAR data and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images in estimating forest diversity over large areas by combining regression models and three different diversity indices (Simpson, Shannon, and Pielou). The researchers used Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) to assess the importance of various variables, including monthly spectral bands, vegetation indices, foliage height diversity (FHD), and plant area index (PAI) during both growing and non-growing seasons.\n\nBy using these variables and regression algorithms (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Lasso Regression), the researchers produced 12 forest diversity maps based on the three diversity indices. The accuracy of the estimation was evaluated using the R-squared (R-2) values of the models.\n\nThe results showed that the most important variables for estimating forest diversity were FHD, NDVI, NDWI, EVI, short-wave infrared (SWIR), and red-edge (RE) bands, particularly during the growing season (May and June)."
