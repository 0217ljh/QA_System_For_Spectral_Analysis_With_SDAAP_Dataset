        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the method's validity to improve the accuracy of identifying the degree of rice blast infection is the JM distance and within-class scatter. The JM distance measures the inter-class separability, indicating how well the selected characteristic wavelengths can distinguish between different disease levels of rice blast. The within-class scatter measures the intra-class aggregation, indicating how well the selected characteristic wavelengths can group together samples within the same disease level.\n\nThe related study states that the characteristic wavelengths selected by the Guided-GradCAM method based on the ResNet-CBAM network structure have a JM distance greater than 1.9 and within-class scatter less than 0.4. This suggests that the selected wavelengths have good inter-class separability and intra-class aggregation."

        "Output": "Deep learning and visualization techniques were used to develop a wavelength selection method for spectral features of rice blast in order to improve the accuracy of identifying the degree of rice blast infection. Specifically, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) structure was designed by combining the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) with the residual network (ResNet). This DCNN structure was trained to learn different classes of disease features.\n\nAdditionally, the guided gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Guided-GradCAM) method was employed to obtain the guided grade-weighted heatmap (Guided-GradHM) of the last layer of convolution. This heatmap provided information about the importance of different wavelengths in distinguishing between disease levels.\n\nBased on the average Guided-GradHM of different disease levels, the spectral characteristic wavelengths were selected. These selected wavelengths demonstrated good inter-class separability and intra-class aggregation, as indicated by a JM distance greater than 1.9 and within-class scatter less than 0.4.\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of the wavelength selection method, statistical analysis (JM distance, within-class scatter) and comparative modeling analysis were conducted. The results showed that the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models constructed using the spectral characteristic wavelengths selected by the Guided"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The Guided-GradCAM method based on the ResNet-CBAM network structure outperforms traditional methods in accurately selecting spectral characteristic wavelengths for different disease levels of rice blast. The results of the related study show that the characteristic wavelengths selected by the Guided-GradCAM method have good inter-class separability and intra-class aggregation. The JM distance, which measures the separability between different classes, is greater than 1.9, indicating a high degree of distinction between disease levels. Additionally, the within-class scatter, which measures the compactness within each class, is less than 0.4, indicating that the selected wavelengths effectively capture the common features within each disease level.\n\nFurthermore, the spectral characteristic wavelengths selected by the Guided-GradCAM method were used to construct random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models for disease level classification. These models achieved the best accuracy in classifying the disease levels, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 97.21% and Kappa values ranging from 96.51% to 96.55%. This indicates that the selected wavelengths effectively capture the distinguishing features of different disease levels, enabling accurate identification and classification.\n\nIn summary, the Guided-GradCAM method based on the ResNet-CB"
