        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related research work is the coefficient of determination (R2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Zn and Pb concentrations) that can be explained by the independent variables (satellite multispectral images). \n\nThe R2 values obtained for Zn prediction using the Random Forest (RF) model are 0.74 (p < 0.01) during training and 0.7 (p < 0.01) during testing. For Pb prediction, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model achieves R2 values of 0.72 (p < 0.01) during training and 0.64 (p < 0.01) during testing.\n\nThe R2 values indicate the goodness of fit of the models, with higher values indicating a better fit. In this case, the RF model performs better for Zn prediction, while the SVR model performs better for Pb prediction.\n\nThe metric of R2 can provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning models in predicting the concentrations of Zn and Pb based on the satellite multispectral images. However, it is important to note that R2 alone does not provide information on the absolute accuracy of the predictions or the potential limitations of the"
