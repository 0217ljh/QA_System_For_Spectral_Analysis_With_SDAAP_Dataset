        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictive performance of the machine learning models in estimating soil properties is the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the predicted values and the actual values. \n\nIn the case of the in-situ data, the R-2 values for estimating soil properties ranged from 0.32 to 0.87. This means that the machine learning models were able to explain 32% to 87% of the variability in the soil properties based on the in-situ reflectance captured by the low-cost spectrometers. \n\nIn comparison, when the exact same modeling experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions, the R-2 values for estimating soil properties ranged from 0.41 to 0.90. This indicates that the laboratory modeling approach achieved higher accuracy in estimating soil properties compared to the in-situ modeling approach. \n\nTherefore, the R-2 metric provides a measure of the predictive performance of the machine learning models, indicating how well they can estimate soil properties based on the given data."

        "Output": "Yes, the developed AI-based spectral transfer function can be used to accurately estimate soil properties in-situ, even with sensors with reduced spectral range, as demonstrated in the related research. The research showed promising results in directly estimating common physicochemical soil properties, such as soil organic carbon (SOC), texture, pH, and calcium carbonates, based on in-situ reflectance captured by a set of low-cost spectrometers operating at the shortwave infrared region. The predictive performance of the machine learning models calibrated and validated using the developed dataset was shown to be promising for in-situ estimation of soil properties.
