This algorithm was applied in the construction of the coal classification model by utilizing the spectral data collected from various objects, including bituminous coal, lignite, and non-coal objects such as sandstones, soils, shales, marls, vegetation, coal gangues, water, and buildings. The algorithm was trained on this spectral data to learn the patterns and characteristics of different objects. Based on this training, the algorithm was able to classify the objects into different categories, specifically distinguishing between bituminous coal, lignite, and non-coal objects. This classification model was then used to analyze and interpret Landsat 8 satellite images of coal mining areas, accurately describing the distributions of bituminous coal and lignite."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method using satellite images for coal exploration has several advantages compared to traditional methods in terms of economy, speed, and accuracy.\n\nIn terms of economy, the use of satellite images eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming on-site exploration. Traditional methods often require extensive manpower, equipment, and resources to physically survey and explore coal mining areas. By using satellite images, the cost of exploration is significantly reduced as it only requires the acquisition and analysis of satellite data.\n\nIn terms of speed, the proposed method offers a much faster approach to coal exploration. Traditional methods often involve time-consuming processes such as drilling, sampling, and laboratory analysis. In contrast, the use of satellite images allows for rapid data collection and analysis, providing real-time information on the distribution and availability of coal in opencast mining areas.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the proposed method using satellite images provides a more precise and comprehensive understanding of coal deposits. Traditional methods may be limited by the complexity of geological structures in coal mining areas, leading to low efficiencies and inaccuracies in exploration. By utilizing spectral data and a multilayer extreme learning machine algorithm, the proposed method can accurately classify different types of coal and non-coal objects, improving the accuracy of coal exploration.\n\nOverall, the proposed method using satellite images for coal exploration"
