        "Output": "Feature fusion improves the model performance in classifying different cervical pathological tissues using Raman spectral data and various machine learning algorithms by combining multiple sets of features obtained from different preprocessing techniques. In the related experiment, two preprocessing techniques were used: partial least squares (PLS) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). \n\nFirst, PLS was used to reduce the dimensionality of the Raman spectral data, resulting in the first 30-dimensional features. Then, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was applied for feature selection, further refining the feature set. \n\nAdditionally, the Raman spectral data was processed using FFT to obtain amplitude information. PLS and XGBoost were again used to obtain the first 30-dimensional features from this amplitude information. \n\nThe classification models used in the experiment included K nearest neighbor (KNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial bee colony support vector machine (ABC-SVM), support vector machine optimized by the cuckoo search algorithm (CS-SVM), particle swarm optimization coupled with support vector machine (PSO-SVM), and the convolutional neural network combined with long- and short-term memory (CNN-LSTM)."
