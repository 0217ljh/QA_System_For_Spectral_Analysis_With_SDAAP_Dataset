        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the findings of the study, machine learning (ML) is not considered a superior alternative to manual counting (MC) for classifying different classes of floating litter. The study states that MC remains the most precise method for classifying different floating objects. ML, on the other hand, has a heterogeneous performance in correctly identifying different classes of floating litter. However, ML does show promising results in detecting floating items, which can be leveraged to scale up monitoring efforts and be used in automated analysis of large sets of imagery to assess relative floating litter contamination."
