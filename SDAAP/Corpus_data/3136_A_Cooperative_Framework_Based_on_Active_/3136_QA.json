        "Output": "The purpose of utilizing the cooperative framework that integrates active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques in the classification of sea ice images is to effectively utilize the massive number of unlabeled samples and improve the accuracy of the classification. \n\nAL is used to acquire the most valuable samples for labeling by integrating uncertainty and diversity criteria. This helps in selecting the samples that are most informative and representative of the different classes of sea ice.\n\nSSL is employed to make full use of the abundant information contained in the unlabeled samples. It selects the unlabeled samples with the most information and little redundancy using a sampling strategy. The transductive support vector machine (TSVM) is used as the classification model in SSL.\n\nThe cooperation between AL and SSL ensures the accuracy of the pseudo-labeled samples obtained through the framework. A label consistency verification procedure is conducted to further ensure the quality of the pseudo-labeled samples. This cooperative approach improves the classification accuracy of sea ice images by effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled samples."
