        "Output": "The performance of the NIRS-SVM approach was superior to the FTIR-SVM approach in the geographical classification of different genotypes of arabica coffee using infrared spectroscopy and support vector machines (SVM). The NIRS-SVM approach correctly classified all test samples with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. On the other hand, the FTIR-SVM approach had a slightly lower performance."
