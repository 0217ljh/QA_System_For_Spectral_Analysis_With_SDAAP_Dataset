        "Output": "The proposed multi-modal feature fusion network outperforms single-modal classifiers in terms of recognizing and classifying citrus leaves affected by Huanglongbing (HLB) and other conditions. According to the study, the highest accuracy achieved by the multi-modal network was 97.89%, while the single-modal network using RGB images only achieved 87.98% recognition and the single-modal network using hyperspectral information only achieved 89% recognition. This indicates that the multi-modal network, which combines both RGB images and hyperspectral data, provides a better way to detect citrus HLB and other conditions compared to using either modality alone."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed multi-modal feature fusion network, which combines RGB images and hyperspectral data, outperforms traditional methods in recognizing and classifying citrus leaves affected by Huanglongbing (HLB) and other conditions. Traditional methods that rely on single-source information, such as RGB images or hyperspectral data, are not able to achieve great detection performance for HLB. \n\nThe multi-modal feature fusion network introduces three contributions to improve the classification accuracy. Firstly, it uses a dimension-reduction scheme for hyperspectral data based on a soft attention mechanism, which helps to extract more useful information from the hyperspectral data. Secondly, it proposes a feature fusion method based on bilinear fusion, which combines the information from RGB images and hyperspectral data to enhance the classification performance. Lastly, auxiliary classifiers are used to extract additional useful information.\n\nIn experiments, the multi-modal network achieved the highest accuracy of 97.89% in recognizing the four categories of citrus leaves (HLB, suspected HLB, Zn-deficient, and healthy) when the amount of data was not very abundant. In comparison, the single-modal network using only RGB images achieved a recognition accuracy of 87.98%, and the single-modal network using only hyperspectral information achieved a recognition accuracy of 89%."
