        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with different machine learning algorithms can be considered superior to traditional methods for accurately and rapidly identifying the geographical origin of coal. The past research states that NIRS is a rapid, non-destructive, and reagent-free analytical method that enables qualitative and quantitative characterization of materials. By employing multivariate data analysis approaches such as principle component analysis (PCA), isometric mapping (Isomap), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and an improved LDA (iLDA), the past research suggests that NIRS can effectively extract features and enhance the identification of coal origin. The experimental results indicate that nonlinear approaches outperform linear approaches, and the combination of kernel partial least squares discriminant analysis with PCA-iLDA provides the best performance with an accuracy of 97.21%. Therefore, the past study supports the idea that NIRS in tandem with different machine learning algorithms is promising for the rapid and accurate identification of coal geographical origin."
