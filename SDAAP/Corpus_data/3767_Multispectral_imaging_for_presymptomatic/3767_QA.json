        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method using machine learning and multispectral imaging contributes to the early detection of visually asymptomatic disease phases in Brassica napus plants by achieving a high accuracy of 92% in detecting light leaf spot infection. This detection is possible even 12 days after inoculation and 13 days before the appearance of visible symptoms. The method utilizes a prototype multispectral system specifically designed for plant studies, allowing for precise canopy-scale measurements. \n\nThe analysis combines machine learning techniques such as feature selection and novelty detection to facilitate the classification of disease phases. Spectral vegetation indices are used to quantify disease severity and its distribution within the plant canopy, providing valuable information for early detection. \n\nAdditionally, the system records the morphology and structure of the plants using photometric stereo, which influences the regions used for diagnosis. This structural information plays a crucial role in reflectance and classification, enhancing the accuracy of disease detection."
