        "input": "",
        "Output": "Six different spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) were derived from the spectral data collected at heading and grain filling stages in wheat. These indices included NDVI, photochemical reflectance index, NWI, anthocyanin reflectance index, normalized chlorophyll pigment ratio index, and GNDVI."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine- and deep-learning-based multitrait (MT) genomic selection (GS) models outperformed the traditional genomic best linear unbiased predictor (GBLUP) and Bayesian models in terms of prediction accuracy for grain yield and grain protein content in wheat using spectral information. The T-M-GS models performed 0-28.5% superior to the unitrait (UT)-GS models. Among the machine- and deep-learning models, random forest and multi-layer perceptron were found to be the best performing models for predicting both traits. On the other hand, the explored Bayesian models gave similar accuracies but were less accurate compared to the machine- and deep-learning models. Additionally, the Bayesian models required increased computational time. Overall, the study concluded that machine- and deep-learning-based MT-GS models significantly increased prediction accuracy and should be utilized in large-scale breeding programs."
