        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning regression methods, specifically support vector machine regression (SVMR) and random forest regression (RFR), were found to significantly improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) compared to parametric regression and linear nonparametric regression. \n\nThe study showed that SVMR and RFR, when used with UAV hyperspectral imagery, achieved the most outstanding estimation performance for winter wheat PNC. The training set of the model at the flowering and filling stages explained 93% and 92% of the PNC variability, respectively. \n\nFurthermore, the testing set of the model at the flowering and filling stages explained 88% and 91% of the PNC variability. The root mean square error of the validation set (RMSEtesting) was 0.82 and 1.23, and the relative prediction deviation (RPD) was 2.58 and 2.40, respectively. \n\nBased on these results, it can be concluded that using SVMR and RFR with UAV hyperspectral imagery is the best choice for estimating winter wheat PNC, particularly at the flowering and filling stages. These findings provide a theoretical basis for developing a precision nitrogen management (PNM) strategy."
