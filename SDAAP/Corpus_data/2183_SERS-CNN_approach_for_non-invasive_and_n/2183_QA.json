        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized in the SERS-CNN approach for remote observation of mesenchymal stem cell behavior by allowing precise analysis of complex spectra of biological samples. These models were able to analyze the biochemical changes in the surrounding culture media due to stem cell proliferation and their biochemical activity. The models were trained to process Raman measurements and advanced spectra data, enabling the remote non-invasive estimation of the degree of cell survival and the proliferation rate. This approach allowed for the analysis of cell behavior without disrupting cell growth and could be performed by untrained staff using widely-available equipment."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The SERS-CNN approach is described as being more advanced and precise compared to traditional methods in analyzing complex spectra of biological samples and determining the species and behavior of microorganisms. Unlike widely-used analytical approaches, machine learning, which is utilized in the SERS-CNN approach, allows for precise analysis of even very complex spectra. This advanced method can provide precise decisions for specific biochemical or microbiological tasks. Therefore, the SERS-CNN approach is considered to be a perfect analytical system capable of solving the sophisticated task of determining the species and behavior of microorganisms."
