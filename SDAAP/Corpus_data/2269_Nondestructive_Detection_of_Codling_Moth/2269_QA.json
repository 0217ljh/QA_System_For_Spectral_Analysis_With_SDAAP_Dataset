        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning models were used to detect codling moth (CM) infestation in apples using near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral reflectance imaging. The researchers applied a gradient tree boosting (GTB) ensemble classifier, along with other machine learning and data processing methods, to build robust and high accuracy classification models.\n\nTo ensure accurate detection, an effective region of interest (ROI) acquisition procedure was implemented. This procedure helped in selecting specific areas of the apple samples that were most likely to contain CM infestation. \n\nAdditionally, optimal wavelength selection was carried out using sequential stepwise selection methods. This process involved identifying the most informative wavelengths within the NIR hyperspectral range (900-1700 nm) for building multispectral imaging models. \n\nThe results of the study showed that the infested and healthy apple samples were classified at the pixel level with up to 97.4% total accuracy for the validation dataset using the GTB ensemble classifier. The feature selection algorithm achieved a maximum accuracy of 91.6% by utilizing only 22 selected wavelengths.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated the high potential of NIR hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning models in effectively detecting and classifying latent CM infestation in apples of different cultivars."
