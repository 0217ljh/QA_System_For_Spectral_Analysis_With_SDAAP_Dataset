The related study states that the diagnostic accuracy of the LR, KNN, DT, and RF models was 87%, 66%, 77%, and 83% respectively. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy metric can go up to 87% in terms of accuracy."

        "Output": "Yes, the proposed strategy of combining SERS technology with logistic regression (LR) can be considered superior to traditional methods for the detection of lung cancer in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The related study states that the diagnostic accuracy of the LR model was 87%, which is higher than the accuracy of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) models (66%, 77%, and 83% respectively). Therefore, LR outperformed the other algorithms in the classification of whole blood using SERS spectra. This suggests that the combination of SERS technology with LR has the potential to be a more accurate method for the detection of lung cancer compared to traditional methods."
