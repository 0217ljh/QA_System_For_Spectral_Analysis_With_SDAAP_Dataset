        "Output": "Yes, the use of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images for forecasting vegetation biophysical indices can be considered superior to other spectral feature processing methods in the study's assessment of different time-series forecasting approaches. According to the study, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images had the highest forecasting accuracy among the three approaches (MA, LSTM, and Conv-LSTM), with 86% of the computed indices being over 50% accurately predicted in the LSTM model. This indicates that these satellite images provide more reliable and accurate information for forecasting vegetation biophysical indices compared to other spectral feature processing methods."
