        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the developed models in the related study for the direct identification of flour with diverse harmful substances was accuracy. The study reported that the asynchronous MM-IR-AlexNet (2T-2DCOS-IR-AlexNet) model achieved a 99.6% accuracy. Therefore, the chosen metric of accuracy was able to assess the performance of the models with a high level of precision."

        "Output": "Yes, the deep learning-based MM-IR method, specifically the asynchronous MM-IR-AlexNet, can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods for the direct identification of flour with diverse harmful substances. The study mentioned in the text demonstrated that the asynchronous MM-IR-AlexNet had the best performance with 99.6% accuracy in identifying target substances in flour. This indicates that the deep learning-based MM-IR method is a robust and accurate approach for the direct detection of trace harmful substances in flour."
