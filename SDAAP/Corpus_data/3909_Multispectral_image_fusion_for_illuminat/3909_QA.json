        "Output": "The proposed novel illumination invariant multispectral palmprint recognition method has shown strong robustness against illumination variation. This means that it is able to accurately recognize palmprints even when there are changes in lighting conditions. Traditional methods may struggle with variations in illumination, leading to decreased recognition accuracy. \n\nIn terms of recognition accuracy, the proposed method has achieved favorable results. In ideal illumination conditions, the recognition accuracy is as high as 99.93%. Even when the lighting condition is unsatisfactory, the method still achieves a recognition accuracy of 99.50%. This indicates that the proposed method performs well in accurately identifying individuals based on their palmprints.\n\nOverall, the proposed method outperforms traditional methods in terms of both robustness against illumination variation and recognition accuracy."
