These include support vector machine, back-propagation neural network, and stacked auto-encoder. However, the deep learning method, specifically the spatial-spectral jointed stacked auto-encoder (SSAE), was proposed as a new method in this work.\n\nThe purpose of proposing the SSAE method is to extract and classify oil slicks on the sea surface more effectively. The researchers found that the SSAE model outperformed the other models, especially for thick oil films. Therefore, the SSAE method provides an alternative approach to extract oil slicks on hyperspectral remote sensing images, improving the accuracy and efficiency of oil slick detection and classification."
