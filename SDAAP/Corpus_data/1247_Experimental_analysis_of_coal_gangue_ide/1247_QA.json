        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in the study on the spectral identification of coal gangue under different working conditions is the F1-score. The F1-score is a measure of the model's accuracy that takes into account both precision and recall. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nThe F1-score can range from 0 to 1, with a higher score indicating better performance. In the related study, the average F1-score achieved by the Lightgbm global model was 99.34% for the local dataset and 97.9% for the global dataset. This indicates that the model has a high level of accuracy in identifying coal and gangue samples under different working conditions.\n\nThe F1-score is a widely used metric in machine learning and provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. It considers both false positives and false negatives, making it suitable for imbalanced datasets or situations where both precision and recall are important. Therefore, the F1-score is a reliable metric to assess the performance of the models in the study."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study on the spectral identification of coal gangue under different working conditions, multiple machine learning algorithms were employed to construct local and global recognition models. The algorithms used in the related study include Lightgbm and 1DCNN. These algorithms were trained using the spectral data of coal and gangue samples collected under various working conditions. The local and global datasets were constructed based on different levels of each working condition. The local model was trained to identify samples at a single level under a specific working condition, while the global model was trained using data from all levels under all working conditions. The results of the experiment showed that the global model, particularly the Lightgbm global model, exhibited higher or equal recognition accuracy compared to the local model. The Lightgbm global model achieved an average F1-score of 99.34% and 97.9% for local and global datasets, respectively. It also had a fast training time of 0.75s and recognition time of 1 ms. Therefore, the machine learning algorithms, especially Lightgbm, were utilized to accurately identify coal and gangue in various working conditions, providing a reliable solution."
