The R-2 value of the best prediction model (CWT-R) is 0.684, indicating that approximately 68.4% of the variability in the SOC content can be explained by the model. The RMSE value is 1.059 g center dot kg(-1), which represents the average difference between the predicted and actual SOC content values. However, the accuracy of the model can also be assessed using the relative analysis error (RPD) value, which is not mentioned in the text."

        "Output": "The combination of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and spectral feature processing methods improves the sensitivity of the spectrum to soil organic carbon (SOC) content and the correlation between the spectrum and SOC content in this research by enhancing the analysis of spectral data.\n\nThe traditional mathematical transformation of spectral data used in previous studies was not sufficient in revealing the correlation between the spectral data and SOC. To address this issue, the researchers in this study incorporated CWT for spectral data processing.\n\nBy applying CWT to the spectral data, the sensitivity of the spectrum to the SOC content is significantly improved. This means that the spectral data becomes more responsive to changes in SOC content, allowing for a more accurate estimation of SOC levels.\n\nAdditionally, the correlation between the spectrum and SOC content is also enhanced through the use of CWT. This implies that the relationship between the spectral data and SOC content becomes stronger, enabling a better understanding of how different spectral features relate to SOC levels.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers employed the successive projection algorithm (SPA) to screen the feature bands. This method helps to identify the characteristic bands that are most relevant to SOC content estimation. By reducing the number of bands containing covariance, SPA enables faster screening of the spectral data and improves the efficiency of the analysis.\n\nOverall, the combination of CWT"
