        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for quantifying metanil yellow adulteration in chickpea flour is the correlation coefficient of prediction (R2p). This metric measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted and actual adulterant concentrations. \n\nBased on the results mentioned in the related study, the R2p values obtained using different methods are as follows:\n- When using full spectra with 2nd derivative preprocessing and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), the R2p value was 0.978.\n- When using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) with no spectral preprocessing, the R2 value was 0.992.\n- When using wavelengths selected through Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) with 2nd derivative preprocessing along with PLSR, the R2 value was 0.989.\n\nThese R2p values indicate a strong correlation between the predicted and actual adulterant concentrations. Therefore, the chosen metric can go quite far in predicting the adulterant concentration in chickpea flour."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The different spectral feature processing methods were evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting the adulterant concentration in chickpea flour using the developed non-destructive NIR hyperspectral imaging system. \n\nThe study compared three different methods: full spectrum with 2nd derivative preprocessing, IRIV selected wavelengths with no preprocessing, and CARS selected wavelengths with 2nd derivative preprocessing. \n\nWhen using the full spectra with 2nd derivative preprocessing, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model yielded a correlation coefficient of prediction (R2p) of 0.978. This indicates a strong predictive ability for the adulterant concentration in chickpea flour. \n\nThe IRIV selected wavelengths with no preprocessing, along with PLSR, resulted in an R2 of 0.989. This suggests that the IRIV method, which iteratively retains informative variables, is effective in predicting the adulterant concentration. \n\nLastly, the CARS selected wavelengths with 2nd derivative preprocessing, combined with PLSR, achieved an R2 of 0.989. This indicates that the CARS method, which competitively adapts and reweights variables, is also effective in predicting the adulterant concentration."
