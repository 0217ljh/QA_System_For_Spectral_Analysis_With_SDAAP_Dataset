The study used partial least squares (PLS) regression to develop quantitative prediction models for the physicochemical properties, and the models achieved R2 values greater than 0.94 for all properties. This indicates a strong correlation between the thermal image parameters and the physicochemical properties of durians. Therefore, the chosen metric of thermal imaging has shown promising potential in accurately predicting the physicochemical properties of durians."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were utilized to predict the physicochemical properties of durians based on thermal images. Specifically, partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to develop quantitative prediction models for the physicochemical properties. The PLS regression models had R2 values greater than 0.94 for all the properties, indicating a strong correlation between the thermal image parameters and the physicochemical properties of durians. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to successfully cluster the three different ripeness levels of durians based on their thermal images. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbour (kNN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were applied to establish optimal classification models for discriminating durian ripeness. Among these algorithms, the SVM classifier demonstrated the best performance with a classification accuracy of 97%. Overall, the study showed that machine learning models, such as PLS regression and SVM classification, can effectively predict the physicochemical properties and ripeness levels of durians based on thermal images."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of the prediction models using thermal imaging and multivariate methods is not directly compared to traditional analytical methods in the provided text. The text states that the study aimed to improve the current analytical methods, which heavily rely on routine analysis and human labor skills. It suggests that thermal imaging coupled with multivariate methods has the potential for nondestructive evaluation of durian ripeness levels. However, it does not provide a direct comparison of the accuracy between these methods and traditional analytical methods."
