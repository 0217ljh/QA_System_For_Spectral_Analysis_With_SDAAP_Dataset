        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the model performance in the study for mapping the spatial distribution of six soil properties in the agricultural watershed in Burkina Faso was the coefficient of determination (R2). The R2 value can go up to 1, indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and actual values of the soil properties."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The results of comparing the four statistical prediction models (multiple linear regression, random forest regression, support vector machine, and stochastic gradient boosting) in mapping the spatial distribution of six soil properties in the agricultural watershed in Burkina Faso showed that the machine learning techniques performed marginally better than the multiple linear regression. Among the machine learning techniques, the random forest regression provided the highest accuracy in most cases."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of high spatial resolution satellite data, terrain/climatic data, and laboratory analyzed soil samples can improve the knowledge of local scale soil information in West Africa. The related study found that these data sources, when combined with statistical prediction models, were effective in mapping the spatial distribution of six soil properties in a 580 km(2) agricultural watershed in south-western Burkina Faso. The machine learning techniques, particularly random forest regression, provided the highest accuracy in predicting soil properties. The study also identified specific satellite data channels and soil indices that were prominent predictors in digital soil mapping. Therefore, by utilizing these data sources and techniques, it is possible to enhance soil information at the local scale in data poor regions like West Africa."
