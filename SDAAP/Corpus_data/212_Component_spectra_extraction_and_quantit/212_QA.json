        "Output": "Yes, terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy and machine learning methods can be considered superior to traditional methods for identifying and quantifying the components of preservative mixtures in this research. The use of THz time-domain spectroscopy allows for the measurement of the unknown multicomponent systems, providing valuable information about the composition of the mixtures. Additionally, machine learning methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), self-modeling mixture analysis (SMMA), and support vector machine for regression (SVR) are employed to effectively extract component spectra, identify the number of components, and quantify the contents of each individual component. These techniques demonstrate high accuracy and precision, as evidenced by the high decision coefficient (R-2 = 0.989) achieved in the validation mixtures. Therefore, the combination of THz spectroscopy and machine learning methods offers a promising and useful strategy for detecting preservative mixtures in practical applications."
