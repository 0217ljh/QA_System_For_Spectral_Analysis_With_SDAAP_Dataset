        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to establish variety identification models for rice seeds was the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC values for each model were analyzed, and the closer the AUC value is to 1, the more effective the model is."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral technology and deep learning methods, such as the ResNet model, can be considered superior to traditional methods for identifying different types and varieties of rice seeds. The study used these techniques to establish variety identification models for five common types of rice seeds, achieving classification accuracies higher than 95%. Additionally, when applied to 10 varieties of rice seeds without considering their types, the ResNet model showed the best classification results with an accuracy of 86.08% on the test set. This demonstrates that NIR hyperspectral imaging technology combined with deep learning can effectively distinguish rice seeds of different varieties in a quick and nondestructive manner."
