This technique was used to retrieve the SSC from high-resolution hyperspectral imagery. \n\nAccording to the related study, this metric was able to accurately measure the SSC at the river confluence, even in the mixing layer where sediments from two different rivers were merging. It was able to provide precise measurements of the concentrations adjacent to the mixing layer, even when the relationship between the spectral data and suspended sediment concentrations of the main river and tributary was substantially different. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric, the conversion technique using hyperspectral clustering, was able to accurately measure the concentrations of suspended sediment at the river confluence, providing detailed information that conventional measurement methods cannot explore."

        "Output": "In their study on the mixing of suspended sediment at the confluence of the Hwang and Nakdong Rivers in South Korea, the researchers utilized machine learning regression with optical variability to retrieve the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) from high-resolution hyperspectral imagery. They applied hyperspectral clustering to classify the water regions of the main river (Nakdong) and its tributary (Hwang). The clustering result at a near-field after the confluence point was strongly related to the mixing degree of flow and sediments from the two different rivers. By using regressors with hyperspectral clusters, they were able to accurately measure the SSC, even in the concentrations adjacent to the mixing layer, where the relationship between the spectral data and suspended sediment concentrations of the main river and tributary differed substantially. This approach allowed them to obtain detailed SSC maps and compare different mixing patterns along the downstream river confluence."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of high-resolution hyperspectral data in this study contributed to a more detailed investigation of the mixing of suspended sediment at the confluence of the Hwang and Nakdong Rivers compared to conventional measurement methods in several ways.\n\nFirstly, conventional techniques for measuring suspended sediment have low resolution, which limits their ability to accurately capture the mixing of sediment in river confluences. In contrast, the high-resolution hyperspectral data used in this study provided more detailed information about the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment. This allowed for a more precise measurement of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) using a cluster-based machine learning regression with optical variability.\n\nSecondly, the hyperspectral clustering technique applied in this study enabled the classification of water regions in both the main river (Nakdong) and its tributary (Hwang). By analyzing the clustering result at a near-field after the confluence point, the researchers were able to assess the mixing degree of flow and sediments from the two different rivers. This provided insights into the spatial distribution and mixing patterns of suspended sediment in the confluence area."
