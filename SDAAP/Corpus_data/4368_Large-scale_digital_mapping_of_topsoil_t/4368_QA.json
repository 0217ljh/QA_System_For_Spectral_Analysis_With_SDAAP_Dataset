        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models on digitally modeling and mapping the spatial distribution of topsoil total nitrogen in the Qorveh-Dehgolan plain was the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics provide a measure of the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of topsoil total nitrogen. \n\nThe RMSE and MAE values obtained for the RF, DT, and CB models were 0.032, 0.035, and 0.043% (RMSE) and 0.0008, 0.001, and 0.002% (MAE) respectively. \n\nThese metrics can provide an assessment of the accuracy of the digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen by indicating the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values."

        "Output": "The results of the study suggest that the use of spectral and geomorphometric variables in digital mapping models can contribute to the accurate assessment of topsoil total nitrogen distribution in the Qorveh-Dehgolan plain. The study used three data mining algorithms (random forest, decision tree, and cubist) to model and map the spatial distribution of topsoil total nitrogen. The covariate selection process identified 14 effective covariates, including two geomorphometric variables (midslope position and normalized height) and two remote sensing variables (SAVI and NDVI). \n\nThe validation of the digital mapping models showed relatively low root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values, indicating a good fit between the predicted and observed values of topsoil total nitrogen. The coefficients of determination (R-squared) for the models ranged from 0.35 to 0.42, indicating a moderate level of explained variance. \n\nThe relative importance (RI) analysis using the %IncMSE index highlighted the significance of the selected covariates in the spatial modeling and distribution of total nitrogen. The geomorphometric variables, along with the remote sensing variables, were found to be important predictors of topsoil total nitrogen distribution."
