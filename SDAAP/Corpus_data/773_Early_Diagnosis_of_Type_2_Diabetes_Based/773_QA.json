Obtained NIRS of entire blood samples from healthy, pre-diabetic, and diabetic patients.\n2. Used the spectral data of the entire spectra in the visible and near-infrared region (400-2,500 nm) for qualitative analysis.\n3. Performed several preprocessing steps, including multiple scattering correction, variable standardization, and first derivative and second derivative steps, to select the best pretreatment method.\n4. Established models using SVM for the early diagnosis of diabetes.\n5. Used the first overtone of water (1,300-1,600 nm) as the research object for an aquaphotomics model.\n6. Drew the aquagram of the healthy group, pre-diabetes, and diabetes groups using 12 water absorption patterns.\n7. Analyzed the aquagram to identify clear differences in the 1,400-1,500 nm region.\n8. Found that the number of hydrogen bonds in water species (1,408, 1,416, 1,462, and 1,522 nm) was correlated with the occurrence and"

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the combination of near-infrared spectra (NIRS), support vector machine (SVM), and aquaphotomics can be considered a superior method for the early diagnosis of diabetes compared to traditional diagnostic methods. The related study showed that the models established using SVM achieved a high accuracy of 97.22% in diagnosing diabetes. Additionally, the aquaphotomics model revealed clear differences in the 1,400-1,500 nm region, indicating a correlation between the number of hydrogen bonds in water species and the occurrence and development of diabetes. The number of hydrogen bonds could potentially serve as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of diabetes. Therefore, the use of NIRS, SVM, and aquaphotomics in combination provides an effective and feasible approach for accurate and rapid early diagnosis of diabetes."
