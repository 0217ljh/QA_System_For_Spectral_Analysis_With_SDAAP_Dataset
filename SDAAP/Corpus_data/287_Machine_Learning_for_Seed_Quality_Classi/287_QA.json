        "Output": "The metric used to predict seed germination and vigor was classification accuracy. For germination prediction, the models reached an accuracy of 82% using FT-NIR data, 90% using X-ray data, and 85% when combining both data sources. For seed vigor, the models achieved 61% accuracy using FT-NIR data, 68% accuracy using X-ray data, and 62% accuracy when combining both data sources."
