        "input": "",
        "Output": "The designed visible/near infrared spectroscopy detection system offers several advantages compared to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness for identifying the quality of grape seed oil and detecting adulteration.\n\nFirstly, traditional methods such as chromatography and mass spectrometry are time-consuming, reagent-intensive, and highly specialized. In contrast, the designed spectroscopy detection system is simple and fast, providing a convenient and reliable method for identifying the quality of grape seed oil.\n\nSecondly, the near infrared spectrometer, which is commonly used for non-destructive analysis, is expensive and has high operating environment requirements. In contrast, the designed visible/near infrared spectrometer is low-cost, making it more accessible and cost-effective for use in the edible oil market.\n\nFurthermore, the system incorporates a discrimination method for both known and new adulterated oil spectra. This addresses a limitation of existing quality discrimination models based on machine learning, which often rely on known oil training sample sets and struggle to accurately predict different adulteration categories that may emerge over time. The designed system uses an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier model for preliminary judgment and then applies an automatic clustering algorithm for further correction. This approach allows for accurate identification of both known and new adulteration categories."
