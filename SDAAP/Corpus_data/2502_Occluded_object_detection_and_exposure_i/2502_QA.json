        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed anomaly detection method using multi-modal data representation and hyperspectral sensing can be used to improve robot manipulation in cluttered workspaces without the need for curated labels. The method combines depth data with a registered hyperspectral data cube, which provides pixel-wise reflectance spectral curves. These spectral curves are invariant in similar material types and can differentiate inter-class material types based on their chemical-physical properties. By assuming the dominance of a single material class and training an unsupervised autoencoder to identify anomalous pixels through reconstruction error, the method can detect anomalies in cluttered workspaces without the need for curated labels. Additionally, heuristically-evaluated motion primitives are applied to perturb and further expose local areas containing anomalies, tying the anomaly detection to robot actions. This approach has been demonstrated to consistently increase the exposed surface area of anomalies in various cluttered environments."
