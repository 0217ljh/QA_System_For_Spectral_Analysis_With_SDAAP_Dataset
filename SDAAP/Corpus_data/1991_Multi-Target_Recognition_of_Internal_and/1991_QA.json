        "input": "",
        "Output": "The manifold learning algorithms were used in the multi-target classification model to reduce the dimension of the spectrum data. Three different manifold learning algorithms, namely supervised locally linear embedding (SLLE), locally linear embedding (LLE), and isometric mapping (ISOMAP), were utilized for this purpose. These algorithms were applied to the extracted average spectrums (390 similar to 1 040 nm) from the region of interests in the hyperspectral images of the potatoes. The low-dimensional data obtained from the manifold learning algorithms were then used as input for the model. The Error Correcting Output Code (ECOC) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) were combined to develop the multi-target classification model. By comparing and analyzing the results of the three models, it was concluded that SLLE was the optimal manifold learning dimension reduction algorithm. Therefore, the SLLE-LSSVM model was determined to have the best recognition rate for recognizing internal and external defects in potatoes using hyperspectral imaging technology."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of semi-transmission hyperspectral imaging technology and the SLLE-LSSVM model can be considered as a superior method for non-destructive detection of internal and external defects in potatoes compared to traditional methods. The research conducted in the present paper demonstrates that this method achieved a high recognition rate for different types of defects in potatoes, including normal, bud, green rind, and hollow heart. The single recognition rates for these defects ranged from 86.96% to 96.83%, and the hybrid recognition rate was 93.02%. These results indicate that the combination of semi-transmission hyperspectral imaging technology and the SLLE-LSSVM model provides an effective and accurate approach for simultaneously recognizing internal and external defects in potatoes. This method offers a feasible qualitative analytical method for rapid on-line non-destructive detection of potato defects, providing a valuable technical reference for potato quality control in the industry."
