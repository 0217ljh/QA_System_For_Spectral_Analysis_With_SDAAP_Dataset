        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed infrared spectroscopic IRN (IR-IRN) method has several advantages compared to traditional methods for the detection of the fish allergen parvalbumin.\n\n1. Accuracy: The IR-IRN method achieved high accuracy in recognizing parvalbumin, with a reported accuracy of up to 97.3%. This suggests that the IR-IRN method is highly reliable and specific in detecting the fish allergen.\n\n2. Speed: The IR-IRN method is rapid, taking approximately 20 minutes to complete the detection process. In contrast, traditional methods such as ELISA require around 4 hours. The shorter detection time of the IR-IRN method allows for quicker screening and identification of parvalbumin in complex food matrices.\n\n3. Required expertise: The IR-IRN method requires minimal expert knowledge for application. This means that individuals with basic training can effectively use the method for large-scale field screening and identification of parvalbumin or other potential allergens. In comparison, traditional methods like SDS-PAGE and ELISA may require more specialized expertise and technical skills.\n\nOverall, the proposed IR-IRN method offers improved accuracy, faster detection time, and reduced expertise requirements compared to traditional methods for the detection of the fish allergen par"
