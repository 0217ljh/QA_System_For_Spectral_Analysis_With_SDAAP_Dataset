Collection of Data: Hyperspectral reflectance spectral data at the leaf and canopy level, as well as the corresponding leaf nitrogen content data, were collected at different growth stages of rice (tittering, jointing, booting, flowering, and filling) during a 2-year rice nitrogen fertilization experiment.\n\n2. Selection of Nitrogen-Sensitive Bands: Correlation analysis and Gaussian process regression (GPR) were used to select nitrogen-sensitive bands for raw spectra and first-order derivative reflectance (FDR) spectra in rice leaves and canopy level.\n\n3. Construction of Nitrogen Estimation Models: Single-band regression analysis, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) methods were used to construct nitrogen estimation models for rice raw spectra data. Additionally, the GPR-RF, GPR-SVR, and GPR methods were used to construct nitrogen estimation models for the selected nitrogen-sensitive bands.\n\n4. Evaluation of Model Performance: The accuracy of the models was evaluated using R-2 (coefficient of determination) and NRMSE (normalized root mean square error) metrics."

        "instruction": "How does the GPR method's selection of nitrogen-sensitive bands and estimation of nitrogen content using hyperspectral remote sensing compare to traditional methods in monitoring and estimating nitrogen content in rice leaves and canopy?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The GPR method's selection of nitrogen-sensitive bands and estimation of nitrogen content using hyperspectral remote sensing is compared to traditional methods in monitoring and estimating nitrogen content in rice leaves and canopy. The results showed that the GPR method's sensitive bands were consistent with the variation rule of the nitrogen content and spectral changes in rice. This indicates that the GPR method is effective in selecting bands that are sensitive to nitrogen content.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the GPR method outperformed traditional correlation regression models. The R-2 values of the GPR model were higher than 0.80, indicating a strong correlation between the estimated and actual nitrogen content. The NRMSE values were also below 10%, indicating low estimation errors. This suggests that the GPR method provides more accurate and stable estimates of nitrogen content.\n\nFurthermore, the GPR method was found to be suitable for both leaf-level and canopy-level estimation. At the leaf level, the GPR model achieved an overall accuracy higher than that of the canopy-level model. However, when using first-order derivative reflectance (FDR) spectra, the canopy-level model using the GPR method was more accurate due to its ability to attenuate background noise in the rice field."
