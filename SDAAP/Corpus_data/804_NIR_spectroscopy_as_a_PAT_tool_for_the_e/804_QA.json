Based on the findings of the related study, near-infrared spectroscopy combined with machine learning can be considered a superior method for monitoring the extraction process in herbal medicines with multiple components. The related study proposed a method using near-infrared spectroscopy and machine learning techniques such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, extreme learning machine (ELM), and Gaussian process (GP) regression to determine the extraction end-point and characterize the real extraction status of Gegen Qinlian Decoction. The GP regression models were found to accurately predict the extraction end-points of various chemical components. Additionally, a calibration-free method called the moving block standard deviation algorithm (MBSD) was also applied for end-point determination. Furthermore, the related study developed a multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) model combined with three statistics for real-time monitoring and malfunction identification during the extraction process. The results showed that the MSPC model successfully detected various types of malfunctions. Overall, the methods proposed in the related study demonstrate the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy combined with machine learning for real-time monitoring of the extraction procedure in complex chemical systems."
