        "Output": "The machine-learning (ML) approach in this study accounts for the unique optical properties and challenging environments of high northern latitude waters by using a regression process that takes into consideration the physical characteristics of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. The ML model is optimized and requires only three Sentinel 3 Ocean and Land Color Instruments (OLCI) bands as input. These bands are selected based on their ability to reflect the specific optical properties of Chl-a in these waters. By using a machine-learning algorithm, the model is able to learn and adapt to the complex optical properties and challenging environments, such as high sun zenith angle, presence of sea ice, and frequent cloud covers. This allows the ML model to estimate Chl-a concentration with improved accuracy, reducing bias by five times compared to previous methods. The ML model is optimized using data from Arctic, coastal, and open waters, ensuring its performance in a variety of optically complex environments. Overall, the ML approach in this study takes into account the unique optical properties and challenging environments of high northern latitude waters by utilizing a regression process that incorporates specific input bands and is optimized for these conditions."
