        "Output": "The developed online hyperspectral imaging system has shown to be reliable in measuring the leaf water potential of tomato plants nondestructively. The system achieved a recognition accuracy of 94.68%, indicating its ability to accurately extract leaf images. Additionally, the system utilized mathematical processing techniques to remove spectral variations caused by defocused leaf images, further enhancing the accuracy of the measurements. The leaf water potential prediction model based on the spectral image information attained using the system also demonstrated good performance, with a standard error of calibration of 0.201, coefficient of determination in calibration set of 0.814, standard error of cross-validation of 0.230, and one minus the variance ratio of 0.755. These results suggest that the developed online hyperspectral imaging system is a feasible and reliable real-time non-destructive measurement technique for assessing the leaf water potential of tomato plants."
