        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) combined with machine learning methods, specifically a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods for the accurate and rapid identification of mine water inrush in coal mines. This approach eliminates the need for complex pretreatments such as principal component analysis (PCA) or drawing spectral maps. The related study demonstrated that the 1D CNN model trained on LIF spectroscopy data accurately identified mine water inrush without the need for preprocessing. The performance of this model was compared to traditional machine learning algorithms and a deep learning algorithm, and it showed superior classification performance. Therefore, LIF combined with 1D CNN can provide a fast and accurate identification of mine water inrush without the need for complex pretreatments."
