        "Output": "The results of the comparison between the machine learning models used in the study to detect sprouting activity in potatoes showed that the highest classification accuracy values were obtained by the hyperspectral imaging system. The accuracy was 87.5% for sliced samples and 90% for whole samples. Data fusion did not improve the classification accuracy for whole tubers, but there was a 7.5% increase in accuracy for sliced samples."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, spectroscopic methods, specifically the three optical systems mentioned (Vis/NIR interactance spectroscopy, Vis/NIR hyperspectral imaging, and NIR transmittance), were compared in their capabilities to detect sprouting activity in potatoes based on the primordial leaf count (LC). The study found that the hyperspectral imaging system had the highest classification accuracy, with values of 87.5% for sliced samples and 90% for whole samples. This suggests that spectroscopic methods, particularly hyperspectral imaging, can be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting sprouting activity in potatoes based on the primordial leaf count."
