        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed 3D-1D-CNN model for feature extraction in complex urban areas using hyperspectral images affected by cloud shadows can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of mining spatial-spectral information effectively, especially in grass and highway areas with missing spectral information in cloud shadow areas. The overall accuracy of the 3D-1D-CNN model is 96.32%, which is significantly higher than that of traditional methods such as SVM, RF, 1D-CNN, or 3D-CNN. This indicates that the 3D-1D-CNN model is more effective in extracting features and mining spatial-spectral information from hyperspectral data, particularly in areas with missing spectral information caused by cloud shadows."
