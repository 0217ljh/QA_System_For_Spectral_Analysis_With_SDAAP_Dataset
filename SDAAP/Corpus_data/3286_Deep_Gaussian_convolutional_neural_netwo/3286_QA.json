        "Output": "The significance of incorporating a hybrid kernel function, specifically the rational quadratic kernel and squared exponential kernel, in the proposed deep Gaussian convolutional neural network model for the detection and classification of cassava diseases using spectral data is that it improves the accuracy of the model. \n\nThe hybrid kernel function combines the strengths of both the rational quadratic kernel and the squared exponential kernel. The rational quadratic kernel is known for its ability to capture long-range dependencies and smooth variations in the data, while the squared exponential kernel is effective in capturing short-range dependencies and local variations. \n\nBy using a hybrid kernel function, the proposed model is able to capture both long-range and short-range dependencies in the spectral data, leading to a more accurate detection and classification of cassava diseases. This improved accuracy is demonstrated by the experimental results, which showed that the proposed hybrid kernel function outperformed both the squared exponential kernel and the rational quadratic kernel in terms of accuracy. \n\nOverall, incorporating a hybrid kernel function in the model enhances its ability to accurately detect and classify cassava diseases, which is crucial for early disease identification and ensuring food security in Sub-Saharan Africa."
