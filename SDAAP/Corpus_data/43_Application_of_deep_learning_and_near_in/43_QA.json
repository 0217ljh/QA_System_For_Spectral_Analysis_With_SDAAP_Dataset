        "Output": "In the proposed rapid analysis method for cereals, deep learning models were used to extract advanced features from near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) data. Specifically, the deep learning-stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) method was employed to extract these features. \n\nOnce the features were extracted, two machine learning models were used to build the prediction model. The first model used was the affine transformation (AT), which is a linear transformation technique. The second model used was the extreme learning machine (ELM), which is a type of feedforward neural network.\n\nBy combining the extracted features with the AT and ELM models, the proposed method achieved good prediction results for cereal analysis. It was also found to be superior to other typical NIR analysis methods in terms of effectiveness."
