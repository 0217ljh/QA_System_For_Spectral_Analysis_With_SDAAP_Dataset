        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction models in the related study was the coefficient of determination (R2). R2 measures the proportion of the variance in the predicted values that can be explained by the model. In the related study, the R2 values ranged from 0.81 to 0.98, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values for the investigated parameters."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers optimized sample preparation for the spectra collected in the study by comparing spectra from sieved and pressed tablets with different pressures (30 and 90 kPa) to powdery samples. This comparison allowed them to determine the most effective sample preparation method for obtaining accurate spectra."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, portable mid-infrared spectroscopy (pMIRS) combined with machine learning can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for predicting selected parameters for soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in vineyards with varying geopedological settings. The study used pMIRS combined with machine learning (Support Vector Machines) to predict SOC, soil inorganic C (SIC), hot-water extractable C (hwC), clay and sand content in ten vineyards with varying geopedological settings. The calibrated SVM models performed well with high R2 values (0.81-0.98) and RPIQ values (5.20-13.0) for all investigated parameters. This indicates that the pMIRS-SVM calibrations were accurate in predicting the parameters related to soil C storage."
