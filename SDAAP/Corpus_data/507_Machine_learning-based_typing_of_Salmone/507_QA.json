        "input": "",
        "Output": "The IRBT system, which utilizes Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, has been found to be a very promising and cost-effective tool for subtyping Salmonella enterica at the O-serogroup level. In terms of accuracy, the IRBT system demonstrated high performance, with accuracy ranging from 97.0% to 99.2% for non-selective media and from 94.7% to 96.4% for selective media. This indicates that the IRBT system is comparable to traditional serotyping-based and molecular methods in terms of accuracy.\n\nIn addition to its accuracy, the IRBT system also offers cost-effectiveness. Traditional methods for subtyping Salmonella enterica below the species level are expensive, technically demanding, and time-consuming, making them limited to reference centers. In contrast, the IRBT system provides a more accessible and user-friendly alternative. It eliminates the need for highly trained personnel and can be easily integrated into routine workflows. This reduces the overall cost and time required for subtyping Salmonella enterica at the O-serogroup level.\n\nOverall, the IRBT system offers a high level of accuracy and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional serotyping-based and molecular methods for subtyping Salmonella enterica at the O-serogroup"
