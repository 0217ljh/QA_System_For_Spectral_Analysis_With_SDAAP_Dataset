        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed method is the median absolute percentage difference (MAPD). This metric measures the difference between the Acolite-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and the ship-based in situ R-rs observations obtained from the Barents Sea waters. The MAPD values range from 9% to 25% in the blue-green bands.\n\nThe proposed method significantly reduces uncertainties compared to those in the literature. By applying a new machine learning-based bandpass adjustment (BA) model to near-simultaneous OLI and MSI images, the spectral difference is reduced from approximately 6% to 12% to less than 10% in the common OLI-MSI bands. This reduction in spectral difference indicates a decrease in inconsistencies and uncertainties in the merging of data products from multisensors."

        "Output": "The proposed machine learning-based bandpass adjustment (BA) model is compared to the conventional linear adjustment method in terms of spectral merging of OLI and MSI images. The study demonstrates that the spectral difference is significantly reduced using the proposed BA model. Specifically, the spectral difference is reduced from approximately 6% to 12% to less than 10% in the common OLI-MSI bands. This improvement in spectral merging is significant compared to the conventional linear adjustment method."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed improved spectral harmonization method is more effective in reducing uncertainties and inconsistencies in downstream products compared to traditional methods for monitoring the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. The related study states that the method significantly reduces uncertainties compared to those in the literature. It specifically mentions that the Acolite-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) has a minimum bias for the study area, with a median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) varying from 9% to 25% in the blue-green bands. This suggests that the proposed method provides more accurate and consistent results compared to traditional methods."
