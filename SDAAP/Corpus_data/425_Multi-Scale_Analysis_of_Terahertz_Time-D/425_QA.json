These wavelet feature parameters characterize the TGO thickness in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs).\n\nTwo types of machine learning regression models were employed: multi-linear regression and machine learning regression. \n\nFor multi-linear regression, partial-scale data based on the four wavelet basis functions (db4, sym3, haar, coif3) were selected. The multi-linear regression model was trained using these partial-scale data to predict the TGO thickness.\n\nFor machine learning regression, full-scale data based on the four wavelet basis functions were selected. The machine learning regression model was trained using these full-scale data to predict the TGO thickness.\n\nBoth methods demonstrated high accuracy prediction performance, with the haar wavelet basis function showing excellent predictive performance. The regression coefficients for the haar wavelet basis function were reported as 0.9763 and 0.9840, further confirming the validity of the multi-scale analysis method.\n\nTherefore, the machine learning regression models were utilized to predict and assess the wavelet feature parameters, enabling the effective inversion of TGO thickness in TBCs."
