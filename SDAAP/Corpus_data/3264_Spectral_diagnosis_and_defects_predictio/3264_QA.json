The related study states that in consideration of the limit of the single temperature curve, six more spectral signals are discussed for describing the weld seam state accurately. These additional spectral signals, along with the electron temperature curve, are used to build the prediction model of welding quality based on extreme learning machine (ELM). The proposed methodologies are verified to be effective with high prediction accuracy."
