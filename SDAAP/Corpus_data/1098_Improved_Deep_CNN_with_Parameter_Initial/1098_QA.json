        "input": "",
        "Output": "The techniques employed in the proposed deep CNN to prevent overfitting and improve the discrimination of tobacco cultivation regions using data from NIR sensors are L2 regularization and dropout. These techniques help improve the generalization ability of the network by reducing overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights and reduces the complexity of the model. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 during training, which helps prevent the network from relying too heavily on specific features or neurons and encourages the learning of more robust and generalizable features."
