        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, spectroscopic methods, specifically Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR), were used in the analysis of different parts of Wolfiporia cocos to screen potential biomarkers. The study found that FT-NIR spectra, combined with machine learning algorithms such as partial least squares discriminant analysis and residual network models, were excellent in identifying Poria and Poriae cutis. This suggests that spectroscopic methods can be considered effective in the analysis of different parts of Wolfiporia cocos for screening potential biomarkers. However, it is important to note that the text does not directly compare spectroscopic methods to traditional methods, so a definitive conclusion on the superiority of spectroscopic methods cannot be made based solely on the information provided."
