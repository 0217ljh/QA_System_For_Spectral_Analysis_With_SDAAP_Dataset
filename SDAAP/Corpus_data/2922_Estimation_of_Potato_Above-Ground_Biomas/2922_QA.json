        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine-learning methods of support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and Gaussian process regression (GPR) were utilized in estimating potato above-ground biomass (AGB) using UAV hyperspectral images by analyzing multiple variables extracted from the images. These variables included canopy original spectra (COS), first-derivative spectra (FDS), vegetation indices (VIs), and crop height (CH). \n\nFirst, a digital surface model (DSM) of the test field was generated using high-density point clouds and three-dimensional spatial information from ground control points. Crop height (CH) was then extracted from the DSM. \n\nNext, feature bands in sensitive spectral regions of COS and FDS were identified using a Gaussian process regression-band analysis tool. This analysis tool analyzed the correlation of the COS and FDS with the AGB in each growth period. \n\nAdditionally, the 16 vegetation indices (VIs) were separately analyzed for correlation with the AGB of each growth period to identify highly correlated VIs and exclude highly autocorrelated variables. \n\nThe three machine-learning methods (SVM, RF, and GPR) were then used to estimate the potato AGB at each growth period."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study demonstrated the potential of UAV hyperspectral images and machine-learning methods in accurately estimating potato above-ground biomass (AGB) and monitoring crop growth through several key findings. \n\nFirstly, the study showed that the correlations of canopy original spectra (COS), first-derivative spectra (FDS), and vegetation indices (VIs) with AGB gradually improved from the tuber-formation stage to the tuber-growth stage and then deteriorated. VIs were found to be the most strongly correlated with AGB, followed by FDS, and then by COS. This indicates that the spectral information obtained from UAV hyperspectral images can provide valuable insights into crop growth and AGB estimation.\n\nSecondly, the study successfully extracted crop height (CH) from the digital surface model (DSM) generated using high-density point clouds and three-dimensional spatial information. The extracted CH was consistent with the measured CH, demonstrating the accuracy of the method in capturing crop height.\n\nThirdly, the study compared the performance of three machine-learning methods - support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and Gaussian process regression (GPR) - in estimating AGB at each growth period."
