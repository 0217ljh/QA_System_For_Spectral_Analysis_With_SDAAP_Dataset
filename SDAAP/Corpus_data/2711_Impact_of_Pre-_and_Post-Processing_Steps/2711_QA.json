Pre-processing Techniques:\n   - Two pre-processing techniques were tested: Standardization and Normalization.\n   - It was found that Inception-based models performed better with Normalization, while RS-based models performed better with Standardization.\n\n2. Neural Network Models:\n   - Two 3D-CNN models were used: Inception-based and RemoteSensing (RS)-based.\n   - The results showed that Inception-based models performed better than RS-based models.\n   - The best results achieved were 92% sensitivity and 94% specificity.\n\n3. Post-processing Algorithms:\n   - Two post-processing algorithms based on a median filter were tested.\n   - The first algorithm applied a median filter to a raw predictions map, while the second algorithm applied the filter to the predictions map after adopting a discrimination threshold.\n   - It was observed that the post-processing step improved sensitivity and specificity by a total of 6.6%.\n   - Both post-processing algorithms had the same effect on the results."
