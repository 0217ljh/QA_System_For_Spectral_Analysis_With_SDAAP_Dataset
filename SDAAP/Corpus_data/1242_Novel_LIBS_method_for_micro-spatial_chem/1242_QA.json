        "Output": "The newly proposed micro-spot method is superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and invasiveness in detecting gunshot residue (GSR). The text states that the micro-spot method provides superior accuracy and spatial information of IGSR distribution in the sample compared to the previously published bulk-line method. Additionally, the micro-sampling method used in the micro-spot method allows for less invasive sampling, minimizing damage to the sample. This is advantageous as it allows for the use of the universal hand's collection method currently used by practitioners, while leaving over 99% of the stub unaltered for further analysis."
