There were evident and significant differences in values of spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) at different ripening degrees, indicating variations in biochemical parameters.\n\n2. Newly developed two-band SRIs were found to be more effective in measuring different biochemical parameters of banana fruits.\n\n3. SRIs extracted from the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and their combination showed better correlation (R-2) with biochemical parameters.\n\n4. The combination approach of artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine regression (SVMR) models, integrated with SRIs, proved to be an effective method for estimating five biochemical parameters.\n\n5. The ANN-TSS-SRI-13 model demonstrated excellent performance in determining total soluble solids (TSS) with high accuracy (R-2 = 1.00 for calibration and 0.97 for validation).\n\n6. The ANN-Firmness-SRI-15 model performed well in determining firmness, showing a high level of accuracy (R-2 = 1.00 for calibration and 0.98 for validation)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study demonstrated the effectiveness of spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) and machine learning models in assessing the biochemical parameters of banana fruits and determining their ripening degrees through several findings. \n\nFirstly, the study found that there were evident and significant differences in values of SRIs at different ripening degrees, which correlated with variations in biochemical parameters. This suggests that SRIs can be used as indicators of ripening stages in banana fruits.\n\nSecondly, the study developed and tested newly developed two-band SRIs, which were found to be more effective in measuring different biochemical parameters. This indicates that these SRIs can provide more accurate estimations of the biochemical characteristics of banana fruits.\n\nAdditionally, the study showed that SRIs extracted from the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and their combination exhibited better correlation (R-2) with biochemical parameters. This suggests that combining different spectral ranges can improve the accuracy of assessing biochemical parameters.\n\nFurthermore, the study integrated machine learning models, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and support vector machine regression (SVMR), with the SRIs. The results demonstrated that the combination of SRIs and machine learning models was effective in estimating the five biochemical parameters in both the calibration and validation datasets with acceptable accuracy."
