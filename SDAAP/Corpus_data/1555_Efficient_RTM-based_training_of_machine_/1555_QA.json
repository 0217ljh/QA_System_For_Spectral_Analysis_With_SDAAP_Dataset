        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms in the study was the relative error score. The relative error score measures the difference between the estimated values and the actual values of the biophysical and biochemical variables, expressed as a percentage of the actual value. The study found that all four machine learning algorithms (ANN, RFR, SVR, and GPR) had high performance with relative error scores below 10%.\n\nThe relative error score can provide a measure of how accurate the estimated values are compared to the actual values. However, it is important to note that the relative error score alone does not provide information about the direction or magnitude of the errors. It only indicates the percentage difference between the estimated and actual values. Therefore, while a relative error score below 10% suggests high performance, it does not provide information about the specific nature or extent of the errors."

        "Output": "The machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were found to estimate biophysical and biochemical variables of unseen targets with high performance. The relative error scores were all below 10%, indicating a high level of accuracy in estimating the crop traits. Among the algorithms, ANNs excelled in terms of accuracy, model size, and execution time when the spectral bands were transformed into principal components and scaled by a z-transformation."
