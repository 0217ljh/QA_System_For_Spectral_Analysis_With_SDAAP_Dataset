        "Output": "In the study, the metric chosen to map regional-scale woody cover in the Limpopo Province of South Africa was the spectral-temporal variability metric. This metric was derived from Landsat TM/ETM-based imagery. The study tested the utility of this metric in combination with different seasons of imagery to determine its effectiveness in mapping woody cover.\n\nThe study found that multi-seasonal composites combining imagery from both the dry and wet seasons produced the highest accuracies. The metric was able to achieve an R-2 value of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 9.4 at the 120 m scale. When using a single season of observations, the dry season imagery performed best, with an R-2 value of 0.74 and an RMSE value of 9.9 at the 120 m resolution.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric, spectral-temporal variability, was able to accurately map woody cover in the study area, particularly when combined with multi-seasonal composites."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study tests the utility of Landsat TM/ETM-based spectral-temporal variability metrics for mapping regional-scale woody cover in the Limpopo Province of South Africa by employing a machine learning framework. The researchers compare the accuracies of Random Forest models derived using metrics calculated from different seasons. They also compare these results to those from fused Landsat-PALSAR data to determine if seasonal metrics can compensate for structural information from the PALSAR signal. Additionally, the study tests the applicability of a statistical variable selection method called the recursive feature elimination (RFE) to automate the model building process and reduce model complexity and processing time."
