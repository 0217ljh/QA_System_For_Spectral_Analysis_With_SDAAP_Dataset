        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the approach combining reflectance spectroscopy with deep learning for rapid proximate analysis of coal is the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the predicted content that can be explained by the model, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect fit. The RMSE value represents the average difference between the predicted content and the actual content, with lower values indicating higher accuracy.\n\nThe experimental results showed that the approach achieved R2 values of 0.981, 0.989, 0.990, 0.985, 0.989 for the content prediction of moisture, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and higher heating value (HHV) respectively. The RMSE values were 0.533, 1.833, 1.111, 1.808, 0.723 for the same content predictions. These results indicate that the approach has a high level of accuracy in predicting the content of different components in coal."

        "Output": "The proposed analytical model, DR_TELM, combines dilated convolution, multi-level residual connection, and a two-hidden-layer extreme learning machine (TELM) in the approach that combines reflectance spectroscopy with deep learning for rapid proximate analysis of coal. \n\nFirst, the model utilizes dilated convolution, which is a type of convolutional operation that allows for an increased receptive field without increasing the number of parameters. This helps in extracting effective features from the coal spectral data.\n\nSecond, the model incorporates multi-level residual connection, which is a technique that enables the model to learn residual mappings by adding skip connections between different layers. This helps in improving the flow of information and gradients through the network, leading to better feature identification.\n\nLastly, the model employs a two-hidden-layer extreme learning machine (TELM) as a regressor. Extreme learning machines are a type of machine learning algorithm that can efficiently handle large-scale datasets. By using TELM, the model is able to predict the content of different components in coal based on the extracted features.\n\nOverall, the combination of dilated convolution, multi-level residual connection, and TELM in the DR_TELM model allows for effective feature extraction, improved information flow, and accurate content prediction in the rapid proximate analysis of"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed approach that combines reflectance spectroscopy with deep learning, known as DR_TELM, offers several advantages over traditional methods in terms of accuracy and speed for rapid proximate analysis of coal. \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the experimental results showed that DR_TELM achieved high coefficients of determination (R2) for the content prediction of moisture, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and higher heating value (HHV). The R2 values were reported as 0.981, 0.989, 0.990, 0.985, and 0.989, respectively. This indicates a strong correlation between the predicted values and the actual values of these coal properties.\n\nIn terms of speed, the test time for DR_TELM was reported to be only 0.034 seconds. This is significantly faster compared to traditional chemical analysis methods, which are known for their slow speed. The use of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), allows for efficient feature extraction from coal spectral data, enabling rapid analysis.\n\nTherefore, the proposed approach combining reflectance spectroscopy with deep learning (DR_TELM) offers both high accuracy and fast analysis speed, making it a promising method for rapid proximate analysis of coal."
