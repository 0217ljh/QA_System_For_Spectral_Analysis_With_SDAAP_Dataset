        "Output": "The objective of using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with a deep learning approach of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the research is to develop an objective and reliable discriminant technique for tobacco leaf maturity level. This technique aims to overcome the subjective nature of grower visual evaluation, which can lead to quality loss and low prices. By using NIR spectroscopy and CNNs, the researchers aim to provide an accurate, reliable, and scientific means of assessing the maturity level of tobacco leaves, thereby improving the yield, quality, and economic value of the harvested tobacco."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the research on developing a discriminant technique for tobacco leaf maturity level can be considered superior to traditional subjective sensory assessment methods. The text states that the maturity judgment of fresh tobacco leaves by grower visual evaluation is subjective, which may lead to quality loss and low prices. In contrast, the proposed maturity discriminant model using NIR spectroscopy and CNNs showed high accuracies in classifying the maturity level of tobacco leaves. The CNN models were also found to have strong feature extraction and learning ability, making them superior to other conventional classification approaches. Therefore, the use of NIR spectroscopy combined with CNNs provides an objective and reliable alternative to overcome the limitations of subjective sensory assessment methods for tobacco leaf maturity level recognition."
