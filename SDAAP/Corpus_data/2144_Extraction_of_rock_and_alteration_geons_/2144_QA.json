        "Output": "The mineral and rock geons were extracted from the HyMap mosaicked imagery scenes in Birjand, eastern Iran through a combination of object-based segmentation and machine learning classification algorithms. The imagery was first segmented using the FODPSO algorithm, which creates higher between-class variances. Then, the output image was classified using the Gaussian process (GP) algorithm. For the classification, 272 geons were used as training areas and 127 geons were used as testing areas. The key alteration minerals, such as alunite, jarosite, kaolinite, muscovite, and montmorillonite, as well as the dominant rock types, including granodiorite, tuff breccia, tuff, ignimbrite, dacite, and andesite, were mapped based on these geons. The accuracy of the final output map was verified through field observations and showed an overall accuracy of 89.66%. This research demonstrated that the integration of FODPSO and GP algorithms can be a new approach for creating geons of rocks and minerals and for lithological and mineralogical mapping in different geological settings."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The integrated FODPSO and GP algorithms showed a higher accuracy compared to traditional methods for mapping key alteration minerals and dominant rock types in Birjand, eastern Iran. The final output map generated using these algorithms achieved an overall accuracy of 89.66%. This indicates that the integration of FODPSO and GP algorithms is a more effective approach for lithological and mineralogical mapping in various geological settings."
