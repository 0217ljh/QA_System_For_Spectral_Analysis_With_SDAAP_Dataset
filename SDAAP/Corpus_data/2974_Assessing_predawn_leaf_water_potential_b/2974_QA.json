        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate predawn leaf water potential (Psi(pd)) is the Root Relative Mean Squared Error (RRMSE). The RRMSE is a measure of the average difference between the predicted and actual values, normalized by the range of the actual values. In this case, the RRMSE for both modelling approaches was between 13-14%.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the RRMSE provides a measure of the relative error between the predicted and actual values. A lower RRMSE indicates a higher level of accuracy, as it means that the predicted values are closer to the actual values."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The variables for estimating Psi(pd) in the two modelling approaches were selected using different methods. \n\nIn the first approach, which used vine's canopy reflectance, several vegetation indices (VIs) were computed and selected. These VIs included SPVi(opt)(1_)(950;596;521;), SPVIopt2_896;880;901;, PRI_CI2(opt_539;560,573;716), and NPCIopt_983;972. Additionally, a time-dynamic variable based on Psi(pd) (Psi(pd)_(0)) was also included in the selection process. The stepwise forward method was used to choose the variables for Psi(pd) estimation in this approach.\n\nIn the second approach, which was based on pigments' concentrations, several VIs were optimized for non-correlated pigments of vine's leaves. These VIs were assessed using hyperspectral reflectance. The variables selected for Psi(pd) estimation in this approach were Psi(pd)_(0), NRIgreen_LUT520;532, and NRIgreen_LWC540;551. The stepwise forward method was also used to select these variables."

        "Output": "Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the use of spectral data obtained from a hand-held spectroradiometer and machine learning algorithms is a superior method for estimating predawn leaf water potential (Psi(pd)) compared to traditional methods. The related study mentions that two modelling approaches were developed using spectral data and machine learning algorithms to estimate Psi(pd) in a commercial vineyard. These approaches yielded the best results, with a RRMSE (Root Relative Mean Squared Error) between 13-14% in both validation modelling approaches. This suggests that the combination of spectral data and machine learning algorithms provides more accurate estimations of Psi(pd) compared to traditional methods."
