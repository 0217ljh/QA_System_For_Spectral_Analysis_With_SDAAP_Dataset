        "Output": "No. Based on the given study, there is no explicit mention of spectroscopic methods being used in this research to determine Arabica coffee yield and identify crucial nutrient thresholds and variables that can maximize yield. The related study primarily focuses on the evaluation of machine learning algorithms, such as the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and random forest models, to predict coffee yield and identify important variables related to the nutritional status of the plants. Therefore, it cannot be concluded from the given information whether spectroscopic methods were used or not."
