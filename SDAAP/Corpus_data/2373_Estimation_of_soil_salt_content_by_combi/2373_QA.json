        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to quantitatively estimate soil salt content (SSC) was the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). These metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the models.\n\nThe coefficient of determination (R-2) measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (soil salt content) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral covariates). It ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model to the data.\n\nRoot mean squared error (RMSE) measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. It provides an estimate of the model's predictive accuracy, with a lower value indicating better performance.\n\nThe ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) is a measure of the model's precision. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the reference values by the RMSE. A higher RPD value indicates a higher precision of the model.\n\nThe study found that all 12 SSC estimation models had an RPD greater than 1.4, indicating that they were able to quantitatively estimate soil salt content with reasonable precision."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The variable selection methods improved the estimation accuracy of the models in the study by identifying the most sensitive spectral covariates from the UAV-borne multispectral data. These covariates were selected based on their relationship with the soil salt content (SSC). \n\nThe gray relational analysis (GRA), successive projections algorithm (SPA), and variable importance in projection (VIP) were used as variable selection methods. These methods helped to identify the spectral bands and spectral indices that had the strongest correlation with SSC.\n\nBy selecting the most relevant covariates, the models were able to focus on the key information in the multispectral data, leading to improved estimation accuracy. The selected covariates provided more accurate and precise information about the soil salinization, allowing for better estimation of SSC.\n\nThe study found that VIP outperformed GRA and GRA outperformed SPA in terms of improving the estimation accuracy of the models. This suggests that VIP was the most effective variable selection method in this study.\n\nOverall, the variable selection methods played a crucial role in improving the estimation accuracy of the models by identifying the most important spectral covariates related to SSC."
