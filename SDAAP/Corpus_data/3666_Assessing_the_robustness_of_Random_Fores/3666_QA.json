        "Output": "The performance of Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) when classifying High spectral, spatial and temporal Resolution Satellite Image Time Series (HR-SITS) data from SPOT-4 and Landsat-8 in the south of France was compared in the study. \n\nBoth RF and SVM classifiers showed their ability to tackle the classification problem with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 83.3% for RF and 77.1% for SVM. However, RF had some advantages over SVM, such as a small training time and easy parameterization.\n\nThe stability of RF parameters was also appraised, and it was found that RF parameters had little influence on the classification accuracy. The difference in OA between the worst and the best parameter configuration was only about 1%.\n\nDifferent input data, composed of spectral bands with or without spectral and/or temporal features, were proposed to enhance the characterization of land cover. The addition of features improved the classification accuracy, but the gain in OA was weak compared to the increase in computational cost.\n\nFinally, the classifier accuracy was assessed on a larger area where landscape variabilities affected the classification performances."
