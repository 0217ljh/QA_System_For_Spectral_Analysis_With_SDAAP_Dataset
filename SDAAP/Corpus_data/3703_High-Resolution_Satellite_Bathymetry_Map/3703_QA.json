        "Output": "The machine learning models were utilized to accurately map bathymetry in shallow coastal waters  using high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery by proposing and assessing new satellite-derived regression and machine learning bathymetric models. These models were validated and compared with respect to measured reference bathymetry. After analyzing nine techniques, ensemble learning approaches were found to have excellent performance, even in challenging scenarios up to 35-m depth, with mean RMSE values around 2 m. This indicates that the machine learning models were able to accurately estimate the water depth in shallow coastal areas using the satellite imagery data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the developed image processing methodology using high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery can be used to accurately map bathymetry in shallow coastal waters. This methodology has been implemented and tested in two different island ecosystems, Cabrera National Park and Maspalomas Natural Protected area, which are known for their richness in endemic species and vulnerability to climate change. The methodology has also been applied to monitor the construction of a new port in Granadilla, Canary Islands. The contributions of this work include improving the preprocessing methodology and proposing and assessing new satellite-derived regression and machine learning bathymetric models. These models have been validated and compared with measured reference bathymetry, and ensemble learning approaches have demonstrated excellent performance, even in challenging scenarios up to 35-m depth, with mean RMSE values around 2 m. Therefore, this methodology can be used for both monitoring construction projects and conserving biodiversity in vulnerable island ecosystems."
