        "Output": "The researchers compared the accuracy of tissue identification using the developed quantitative method and machine learning method to the findings in adjacent H & E-stained frozen sections by assessing the spectral patterns obtained from Raman spectroscopy. They compared the results of the quantitative method and machine learning method to the tissue types identified in the adjacent H & E-stained frozen sections. The researchers found that both methods achieved high classification accuracy (>85%), indicating that the developed methodology accurately identified the four types of tissue (sarcoma, benign muscle, fat, and dermis) when compared to the findings in the adjacent H & E-stained frozen sections."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the developed Raman spectroscopy methodology can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods for real-time detection and classification of tumors after resection with negative sarcoma margins. The related study presents a quantitative method and a machine learning method that achieved high classification accuracy (>85%) in identifying different tissue types, including sarcoma and surrounding benign muscle, fat, and dermis. This indicates that the analytical methodology using Raman spectroscopy can accurately detect and classify tumors in real-time during surgery. Furthermore, the potential use of a hand-held Raman probe in the operating room could provide real-time in vivo capability for assessing sarcoma resection margin status."
