        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, the Gromov-Wasserstein (G-W) and fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FG-W) approaches resulted in significantly greater alignment accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models such as SVM, CNN, and RNN. This suggests that the G-W and FG-W approaches may be considered superior to these traditional models in the research on the potential of using domain adaptation on fNIRS data to classify different levels of n-back tasks that involve working memory."
