        "Output": "Yes, based on the findings of the related tudy, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) coupled with Deep Learning (DL) models can be considered superior to traditional methods for Alzheimer's disease (AD) multi-class classification. The study demonstrated that DL models, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), achieved the highest accuracy in classifying AD severity using the original dataset of three hemoglobin types. Compared to conventional machine learning algorithms, DL models produced better classification performance. These findings validate the capability of DL frameworks and fNIRS-based approaches in the development of AD diagnosis systems."
