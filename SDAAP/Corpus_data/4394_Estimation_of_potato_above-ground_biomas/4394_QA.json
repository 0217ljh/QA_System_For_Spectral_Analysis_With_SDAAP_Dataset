        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of potato AGB estimation is the normalized root mean square error (RMSE). This metric measures the average difference between the estimated AGB values and the actual AGB values, normalized by the range of the actual AGB values. \n\nThe study found that different forms of texture features obtained from RGB images, combined with crop height, improved the accuracy of potato AGB estimates. Specifically, using the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) technique, the AGB estimation improved by 22.97% compared to using only all GLCM-based textures, 14.63% compared to using only all Gabor-based textures, 9.74% compared to using GLCM-based textures combined with crop height, and 8.18% compared to using Gabor-based textures combined with crop height. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of normalized RMSE was effective in evaluating the accuracy of potato AGB estimation, and the use of different forms of texture features combined with crop height significantly improved the estimation."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of texture features obtained from ultrahigh-ground-resolution (GDS) red-green-blue (RGB) images, along with crop height, can be considered as a superior method compared to traditional methods for estimating potato above-ground biomass (AGB). The study mentioned in the text found that combining different forms of texture features with crop height improved the accuracy of potato AGB estimates. Specifically, using multi-resolution GLCM-based and multiscale Gabor-based textures along with crop height yielded the best results. This approach outperformed using single-type textures or traditional methods that rely solely on optical vegetation indices. The results showed significant improvements in estimating AGB, with normalized root mean square error reduced by 22.97% compared to using only GLCM-based textures, and by 14.63% compared to using only Gabor-based textures. Therefore, the use of texture features obtained from RGB images, combined with crop height, can be considered a superior method for estimating potato AGB."
