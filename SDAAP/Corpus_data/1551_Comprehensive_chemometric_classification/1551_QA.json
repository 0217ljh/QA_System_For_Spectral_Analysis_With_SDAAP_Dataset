        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, three machine learning algorithms were applied to classify snack samples based on frying oil, raw material, place of origin, and production technology. The algorithms used were partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), multilayer feed-forward of resilient backpropagation network (RPropMLP), and random forest (RF). These algorithms were chosen for their ability to analyze qualitative properties of the snack products.\n\nTo determine the classification, the researchers used near infrared spectroscopy combined with the machine learning algorithms. Near infrared spectroscopy is a technique that measures the interaction of light with the molecular vibrations of the snack samples. This data was then fed into the machine learning algorithms to train them to classify the samples based on the four qualitative aspects.\n\nCustom validation protocols were developed to optimize the number of samples used in the study. Cross-validation and test validation were used to verify the robustness of the models. The accuracy of the models was found to be above 0.80 in each case, indicating their effectiveness in classifying the snack samples.\n\nBased on the results, the neural network-based algorithm (RPropMLP) outperformed the other algorithms in terms of accuracy and area under the ROC curve values. This suggests that neural network-based algorithms have an advantage when working"
