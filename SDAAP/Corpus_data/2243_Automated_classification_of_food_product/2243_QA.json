        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy in the related research is the fitting error versus the regularization parameter alpha. This metric can go as far as determining the optimal value of alpha for smoothing the probability distribution without significantly worsening the bias, thus aiding in the autonomous authentication of different types of food products based on T1-T2 and D-T2 data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes,based on the given text, it can be inferred that the low-field proton and sodium relaxation and diffusion measurements are considered as an effective spectroscopic method for detecting and classifying different types of food products in the developed system. The text mentions that these measurements are used to detect and classify food products, and the system developed based on these measurements is able to autonomously authenticate such products. Additionally, the text states that the experimental results demonstrate reliable classification of cooking oils, milk, and soy sauces. Therefore, it can be concluded that the low-field proton and sodium relaxation and diffusion measurements are considered superior to traditional methods for detecting and classifying different types of food products in the developed system."
