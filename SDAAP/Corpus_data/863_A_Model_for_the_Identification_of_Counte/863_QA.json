        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method using FTIR technology and machine learning is more advanced and effective compared to traditional methods in identifying counterfeit and adulterated sika deer antler cap powder. Traditional methods often rely on visual inspection or basic chemical tests, which can be subjective and easily deceived by skilled counterfeiters. \n\nIn contrast, the FTIR technology used in this method allows for the analysis of the molecular composition of the powder, providing more accurate and objective results. By measuring the absorption of infrared light by the sample, FTIR can identify specific functional groups and chemical bonds present in the powder, distinguishing between authentic and counterfeit products.\n\nFurthermore, the machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme learning machine (ELM), enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the identification process. These algorithms are trained on a large dataset of authentic and adulterated samples, allowing them to learn patterns and make accurate predictions based on the spectral data.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the proposed method achieved a recognition rate of 100% for the training and test sets, surpassing the traditional methods."
