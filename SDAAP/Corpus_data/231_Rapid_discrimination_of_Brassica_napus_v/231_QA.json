        "instruction": "Can the combination of standard normal variate and support vector machine be used in past study on the discrimination of eight Brassica napus varieties in Korea?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of standard normal variate and support vector machine can be used in past study on the discrimination of eight Brassica napus varieties in Korea. When using multiple preprocessing and chemometric methods for discrimination, the maximum classification accuracy was achieved with the combination of standard normal variate and support vector machine, reaching up to 98.2%. Therefore, this combination was found to be effective in distinguishing between the different Brassica napus varieties in past study."
