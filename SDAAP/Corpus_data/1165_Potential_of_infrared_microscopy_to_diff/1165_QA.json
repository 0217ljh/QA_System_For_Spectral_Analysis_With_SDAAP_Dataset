The study mentioned in the text evaluated the potential of this approach and found that it achieved a success rate of better than 93% in differentiating between DLB and AD patients. This suggests that it is a sensitive method that can detect minor changes in the biochemical structures associated with the development of these diseases. In addition, the use of machine learning algorithms allows for the analysis of complex data patterns, which can improve the diagnostic accuracy and objectivity compared to traditional methods. Therefore, this new approach has the potential to be a simple and powerful tool for mental health professionals, enhancing the reliability and objectivity of diagnoses for both AD and DLB."
