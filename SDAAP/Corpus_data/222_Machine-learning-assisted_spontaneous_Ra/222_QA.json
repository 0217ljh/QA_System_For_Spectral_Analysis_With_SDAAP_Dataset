The spectral analysis methods used were principal component analysis (PCA), random forest (RF), and one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network (CNN) methods. These models were trained on the Raman spectra data collected from 207 normal and 500 tumor sites from 10 human laryngeal cancer surgical specimens. The models were then used to predict the first three principal components (PCs) of normal and tumor data. The random forest (RF) and CNN models demonstrated high performances in predicting the PCs, except for the tumor PC2. The CNN model showed the highest performance overall, with an accuracy of 96.1%, sensitivity of 95.2%, and specificity of 96.9% on average over 50 trials."

        "Output": "The performance of the Raman spectroscopy system for the rapid intraoperative detection of human laryngeal carcinoma is compared to traditional methods in past study. The past study found that the Raman spectroscopy system, specifically the 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) method, demonstrated higher performance compared to traditional methods.\n\nThe Random Forest (RF) analysis, which is a traditional method, yielded an overall accuracy of 90.5%, sensitivity of 88.2%, and specificity of 92.8% on average over 10 trials. On the other hand, the 1D CNN method, which is part of the Raman spectroscopy system, showed even better performance with an accuracy of 96.1%, sensitivity of 95.2%, and specificity of 96.9% on average over 50 trials.\n\nTherefore, the Raman spectroscopy system, particularly the 1D CNN method, outperformed traditional methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the rapid intraoperative detection of human laryngeal carcinoma."
