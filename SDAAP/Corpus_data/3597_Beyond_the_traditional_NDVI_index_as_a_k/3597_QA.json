        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning regression models were used in the development of the rapid yield forecast methodology based on UAV data by analyzing the relationship between the canopy thickness and grape production. The models were trained using the data collected from different vineyards and years, and they were used to predict the yield based on the canopy thickness measurements obtained from the UAV imagery. The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated, and the best performing machine learning models achieved an average accuracy of 85.95%. This indicates that the machine learning regression models were effective in forecasting the grape yield using the canopy thickness as a key parameter."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No, the potential of new canopy geometry-based indices for characterizing agronomic parameters cannot be evaluated using spectroscopic methods compared to traditional NDVI based on spectral response of the canopy top. The related study states that the aim of the work was to evaluate the potential of these new indices for characterizing agronomic parameters using photogrammetry techniques with high-resolution RGB cameras, not spectroscopic methods. The related study also mentions that the acquisition and analysis of spectral data require costs and skills that are often not sufficiently available, indicating that spectroscopic methods may not be feasible in this context."
