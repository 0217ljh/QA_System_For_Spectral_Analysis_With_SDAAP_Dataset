        "input": "",
        "Output": "in detecting fraudulent minced meat substitution, machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models, were used to detect fraudulent minced meat substitution. The models were developed and evaluated using spectroscopic data obtained from visible (Vis) and fluorescence (Fluo) spectra, as well as multispectral image (MSI) acquisition. \n\nFor each case of adulteration (beef with bovine offal and pork with chicken), meat pieces were minced and mixed to achieve different levels of adulteration. Different samples were prepared for each level of adulteration, resulting in a total of 120 samples. \n\nThe spectroscopic data from these samples were then used to train the SVM models. The models were trained to classify the samples into different categories based on the level of adulteration and the type of adulterant present. \n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated based on their accuracy in correctly classifying the samples. The MSI-based models showed the highest accuracy scores, ranging from 87% to 100%. The Vis-based models followed with accuracy scores ranging from 57% to 97%. The Fluo-based models demonstrated the lowest performance."

The accuracy scores of the MSI-based models ranged from 87% to 100%, indicating a high level of accuracy in detecting adulteration. In comparison, the Vis-based models had accuracy scores ranging from 57% to 97%, while the Fluo-based models demonstrated the lowest performance. Therefore, the MSI-based models outperformed the other sensor-based models in detecting and quantifying minced meat adulteration."
