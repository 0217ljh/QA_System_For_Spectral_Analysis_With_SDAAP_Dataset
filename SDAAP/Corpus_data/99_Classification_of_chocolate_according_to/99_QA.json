        "Output": "The metric chosen for classifying chocolates with different percentages of cocoa was the absorbance curve obtained from the Fourier Transform of the acquired data matrices. This metric was used in combination with machine learning algorithms, specifically the Gaussian SVM algorithm with a kernel scale of 0.35 and a one-against-one multiclass method.\n\nThe classification achieved differences of around 93% using this metric and algorithm combination. However, it is important to note that this percentage refers to the accuracy of the classification model and not the actual classification of the chocolates. The accuracy of the classification model indicates how well the model can predict the correct class labels for the chocolates based on their absorbance curves.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric, in combination with the machine learning algorithm, can go as far as achieving an accuracy of around 93% in classifying chocolates with different percentages of cocoa."

        "Output": "Yes. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis can be considered as superior methods for non-destructively classifying chocolates based on their cocoa content. Past study demonstrated that by analyzing the spectra of chocolate samples using Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and applying multivariate analysis techniques such as Fourier Transform and Principal Component Analysis, it was possible to accurately classify chocolates with different percentages of cocoa. The use of machine learning algorithms, specifically the Gaussian SVM algorithm with a kernel scale of 0.35 and a one-against-one multiclass method, achieved a classification accuracy of around 93%. This suggests that these methods can be successfully applied in the industry to classify chocolates without the need for destructive testing."
