        "Output": "In this study, the Gaussian processes regression (GPR) models for both green LAI (LAI(G)) and brown LAI (LAI(B)) were developed by using LAI ground measurements from multiple campaigns associated with airborne or satellite spectra. These ground measurements were collected during various European study sites. \n\nThe GPR models were developed to estimate LAI(G) and LAI(B) based on the spectral information obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite images. The models were trained using the LAI ground measurements and the corresponding spectral data from the satellite images. \n\nOnce the GPR models were developed, a processing chain was implemented to apply these models to 52 Sentinel-2 images. This processing chain generated a multiband LAI product at a spatial resolution of 20 meters. \n\nTo validate the accuracy of the GPR models, insitu data from various European study sites were used. The validation results showed that the GPR models performed well for both LAI(G) (R-2 = 0.7, RMSE = 0.67 m(2)/m(2)) and LAI(B) (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.43 m(2)/m(2))."

        "Output": "The accuracy of estimating LAI using the developed Gaussian processes regression (GPR) models is comparable to traditional methods in agricultural applications. The models were adequately validated with in-situ data from various European study sites, resulting in a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.7 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.67 m(2)/m(2) for LAI(G) estimation, and an R-2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 0.43 m(2)/m(2) for LAI(B) estimation. These validation results indicate that the GPR models provide reliable estimates of LAI, both for green vegetation and senescent, brown vegetation."
