        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the spectroscopic liquid biopsy approach for detecting the recurrence of NMIBC in urine is promising and shows potential for improvement compared to traditional methods. The study found that the spectroscopic method achieved a 0.92 area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) with 86% sensitivity and 77% specificity. This indicates that the spectroscopic approach has a high accuracy in identifying the recurrence of NMIBC in urine samples. \n\nIn comparison, traditional methods for detecting NMIBC recurrence typically involve follow-up visits and cystoscopy examinations, which are invasive and can lead to complications. The spectroscopic liquid biopsy approach offers a less invasive alternative, reducing the need for frequent cystoscopy examinations and potentially reducing complications associated with invasive procedures. \n\nOverall, the spectroscopic liquid biopsy approach shows promise in improving the detection of NMIBC recurrence and reducing the need for invasive procedures, making it a potentially valuable tool in clinical practice."
