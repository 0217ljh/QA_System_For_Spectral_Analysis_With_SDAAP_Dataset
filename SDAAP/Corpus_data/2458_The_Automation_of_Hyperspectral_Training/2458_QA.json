        "Output": "The researchers compared the model training accuracies between the automatic labelling algorithm and the classic visual delineation of regions of interest using a logistic regression machine learning approach. They measured the accuracies of the automatically labelled datasets and compared them to the accuracies of the manually labelled ones. The results showed that the modelling accuracies of the automatically labelled datasets were higher than those of the manually labelled ones for both potatoes and wheat. The accuracies were reported as 98.80% for P. infestans in potato, 97.69% for P. striiformis in soft wheat, and 96.66% for P. triticina in durum wheat."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of hyperspectral measurements and the proposed image labelling and segmentation algorithm contribute to the potential of early disease detection compared to traditional methods in several ways. \n\nFirstly, hyperspectral measurements provide a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing for the detection of subtle changes in plant health that may indicate the presence of disease at an early stage. This is in contrast to traditional methods that rely on visual inspection or limited spectral measurements, which may miss early signs of disease.\n\nSecondly, the proposed image labelling and segmentation algorithm improves the objectivity and accuracy of identifying and delineating regions of interest containing visible symptoms of the disease. By automating this process, the algorithm reduces the subjectivity and variability that can occur with manual labelling, leading to more reliable training libraries.\n\nFurthermore, the algorithm extends the labelling to pre-visible symptoms, which is crucial for early disease detection. By identifying and including these pre-visible symptoms in the training library, the algorithm enhances the ability to detect disease at a previsible stage, before the pathogen has fully manifested its symptoms. This is a significant advantage over traditional methods that often rely on the presence of visible symptoms to identify disease."
