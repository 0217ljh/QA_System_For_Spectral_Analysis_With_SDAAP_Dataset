        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models in the related study was the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) criteria. These metrics are commonly used in regression analysis to assess the accuracy and performance of predictive models.\n\nThe MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values, providing an indication of the model's overall accuracy. The RMSE calculates the square root of the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values, giving a measure of the model's precision. The R2 statistic represents the proportion of the variance in the response variable that can be explained by the predictors, indicating the model's goodness of fit.\n\nThese metrics provide quantitative measures to assess the performance of the models in predicting soil nutrient element levels. However, it is important to note that these metrics have limitations and should be interpreted in conjunction with other factors. They do not provide information about the direction or pattern of errors, and they may not capture all aspects of model performance. Therefore, additional analysis and interpretation are necessary to fully understand the models' capabilities and limitations."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, the Cok-GPR method was compared with the Cok and GPR models separately. The comparison was based on their performance in predicting soil nutrient element levels. The evaluation criteria used for comparison were MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and R2 (Coefficient of Determination). The performance of each model was assessed using these criteria, and the model with the lowest MAE and RMSE values and the highest R2 value was considered the best. The Cok1 model, using Ca_ICP-OES, K_ICP-OES, and Mg_ICP-OES as predictors, was found to be the best among the Cok models, with MAE = 1.28 mg/kg, RMSE = 164.42 mg/kg, and R2 = 0.85. The GPR1 approach, using the same predictors, was found to be the best among the GPR models, with MAE = 85.43 mg/kg, RMSE = 137.59 mg/kg, and R2 = 0.83. However, the hybrid Cok1-GPR model outperformed both the Cok and GPR models, with MAE = 76.84 mg/kg"

        "Output": "The performance of the Cok1-GPR hybrid model is superior to the traditional methods (Cok and GPR) in predicting soil nutrient element levels. The Cok1 model, which uses the Cok method with predictors Ca_ICP-OES, K_ICP-OES, and Mg_ICP-OES, gave the best performance among the traditional methods, with MAE = 1.28 mg/kg, RMSE = 164.42 mg/kg, and R2 = 0.85. However, the corresponding GPR1 approach, which used the same predictors, outperformed the Cok1 model with MAE = 85.43 mg/kg, RMSE = 137.59 mg/kg, and R2 = 0.83. \n\nThe hybrid Cok1-GPR model further improved the prediction accuracy, with MAE = 76.84 mg/kg, RMSE = 102.11 mg/kg, and R2 = 0.91. This indicates that the Cok-GPR method can generate more accurate soil nutrient element maps with fewer sampling points compared to the traditional methods. Therefore, the Cok-GPR model is a more efficient and effective approach for predicting soil nutrient element levels at the regional level and can be"
