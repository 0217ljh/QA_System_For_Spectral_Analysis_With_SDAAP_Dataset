        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral imaging technology can be considered a superior alternative to traditional analytical methods for measuring the contents of phycobiliproteins and chlorophyll-a in Neopyropia thalli. The related study states that the traditional analytical methods have several limitations, which suggests that they may not be as accurate or efficient. In contrast, the high-throughput, nondestructive, optical method based on hyperspectral imaging technology developed in this study provides fast, accurate, and noninvasive phenotyping of the pigments. The study also demonstrates satisfactory robustness and accuracy when validating the optimal models using field-collected samples. Therefore, hyperspectral imaging technology offers advantages over traditional methods and can benefit macroalgae breeding, phenomics research, and other related applications."
