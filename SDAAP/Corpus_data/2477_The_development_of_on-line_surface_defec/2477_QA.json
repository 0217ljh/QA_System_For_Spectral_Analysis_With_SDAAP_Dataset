        "Output": "In the development of the on-line surface defect system using hyperspectral images for jujubes, two machine learning models were used: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). These models were employed to classify the surface defects of jujubes based on the hyperspectral images.\n\nThe classification accuracies of the SVM and ANN models, using the full wavelength range of 468-950 nm, were found to be 96.3% and 96.5% respectively. However, the processing time for one jujube face was 320 seconds for the SVM model and 25 seconds for the ANN model.\n\nTo reduce the computation time of the online classification tasks, spectral bands were selected from a wavelength range of 468-760 nm. This selection was done either by using equal band intervals or by applying the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method.\n\nExperimental results showed that using 14 bands (469, 491, 513, 535, 558, 580, 602, 624, 646, 668, 691, 713, 735, and 757 nm) selected by equal wavelength intervals, the accuracy of the SVM model was 94.4% and the accuracy of the ANN model was 95%."
