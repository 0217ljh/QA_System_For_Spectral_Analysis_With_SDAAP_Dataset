        "Output": "In the related study, the Support-Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm was used to classify the lithological units in the complex area in Egypt. The SVM classifier was trained and tested on a reference map, which was built using various data sources such as FCCs, principal and independent component analysis of remote sensing images, and previous geological maps. \n\nTo differentiate the lithological units, the SVM algorithm was applied to the combined high spectral resolution Sentinel 2 data along with the concentrations of potassium (K), thorium (Th), and uranium (U) in the rocks. The remote sensing datasets provided spectral reflectances that reflected the variations in chemical element concentrations, while the gamma-ray spectrometric measurements recorded the concentrations of K, Th, and U.\n\nTo incorporate the chemical concentrations in the classification, the K, Th, U, and total count maps were interpolated using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method and cubically resampled. These maps were then fused with the Sentinel 2 data. By adding the individual chemical concentrations (U, K, and Th) to the classification, the overall accuracy of the classification was improved by 4.14%, 5.11%, and 6.83% respectively."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The integration of Sentinel 2 data with airborne geophysical spectrometric data has been found to significantly improve the classification and differentiation of lithological units in a complex area in Egypt compared to traditional methods. \n\nThe study utilized the Support-Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm to classify the combined high spectral resolution Sentinel 2 data with the concentrations of K, Th, and U in the rocks. By incorporating the chemical concentrations in the allocation, the overall accuracy of the classification was increased by 4.14% for U, 5.11% for K, and 6.83% for Th.\n\nFurthermore, blending the total count band (K + Th + U) with Sentinel 2 data resulted in an outstanding boost in classification accuracy by 7.77%. This indicates that the fusion of remote sensing data with geophysical spectrometric data provides a more precise and sophisticated lithological map.\n\nThe effectiveness of this integrated approach was verified through field reconnaissance, further validating the improved classification results. Overall, the integration of Sentinel 2 data with airborne geophysical spectrometric data proves to be a superior method for improving the classification and differentiation of lithological units in a complex area in Egypt compared to traditional methods."
