        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of the MEDA transfer learning approach in detecting plastic contamination in soil using an ultra-portable NIR sensor is higher than that of conventional multivariate analysis. The MEDA transferable models achieved an average classification accuracy of 97.78% in source soil regions and 79.52% in target soil regions. On the other hand, the average accuracy of conventional SVM models was lower than that of MEDA models. Therefore, the results suggest that the MEDA method, as a transfer learning approach, is more accurate in detecting plastic contamination in soil compared to conventional multivariate analysis."
