        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, near-infrared spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional shell-breaking methods for non-destructive detection of mold in walnuts. The developed prediction model achieved 100% accuracy in identifying moldy walnuts. This indicates that the spectroscopy method is highly accurate in detecting mold without the need for physically breaking the shells of the walnuts. Additionally, the non-destructive nature of near-infrared spectroscopy allows for the preservation of the walnuts' integrity, which is an advantage over traditional shell-breaking methods."
