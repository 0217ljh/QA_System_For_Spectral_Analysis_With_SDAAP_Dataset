        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models in this study was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the yield data that can be explained by the satellite-image data. It ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model to the data."

        "Output": "In the related study, two types of yield-prediction models were adjusted for coffee crops using satellite images and high-density yield data. The models used were random forest (RF) regression and multiple linear regression (MLR). \n\nTo adjust the models, different datasets were created using time series of satellite-image data and coffee yield data. The satellite images used were obtained from the PlanetScope (PS) platform. \n\nThree different datasets were used for model fitting: \n1) Spectral bands-red, green, blue, and near-infrared\n2) Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)\n3) Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI)\n\nBoth the RF and MLR models were able to reproduce the spatial variability of yield maps one year before harvest using the spectral bands, NDVI, and GNDVI datasets. This information is crucial for making management decisions throughout the coffee crop season. \n\nFor yield quantification, the RF model using spectral bands showed the best results, with a validation set R-2 value of 0.93 and the lowest prediction errors."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of spectral bands, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) in the yield-prediction models showed promising results in reproducing the spatial variability of yield maps for coffee crops. The study found that whether using random forest (RF) regression or multiple linear regression (MLR), these satellite-image data variables were able to accurately capture the spatial variability of coffee yield maps one year before harvest. \n\nCompared to traditional methods, such as relying solely on visual observation or manual measurements, the use of spectral bands, NDVI, and GNDVI provided a more objective and quantitative approach to assessing the spatial variability of coffee crop yield. These variables allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of the coffee crop's performance across the field, enabling better management decisions throughout the season.\n\nFurthermore, the RF model using spectral bands demonstrated the best results in terms of yield quantification, achieving an R-2 value of 0.93 for the validation set and the lowest errors of prediction. This indicates that the use of spectral bands in the yield-prediction models outperformed traditional methods in accurately estimating coffee crop yield."
