        "input": "",
        "Output": "The integration of feature engineering and machine learning algorithms using Raman spectroscopy has shown to be more effective in detecting glioma patients compared to traditional methods. Traditional methods typically rely on manual analysis and interpretation of data, which can be time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, the combination of Raman spectroscopy with feature engineering and machine learning algorithms allows for automated and objective analysis of the collected serum spectra.\n\nIn this study, two feature extraction algorithms, partial least squares (PLS) and principal component analysis (PCA), were used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Then, feature selection methods such as Relief-F (RF), the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), the F-score (FS), and term variance (TV) were applied to select the most relevant features. Finally, classification models including back-propagation neural network (BP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM) were established.\n\nThe experimental results showed that the integrated approach achieved high accuracy rates in detecting glioma patients. Specifically, the PLS-Relief-F-BP, PLS-F-Score-BP, PLS-LDA, and PLS-Relief-F-SVM models had accuracy rates of 97.58%, 96.33%, 97."
