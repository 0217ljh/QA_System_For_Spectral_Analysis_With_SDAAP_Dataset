        "Output": "The metric chosen to classify and identify lithology at a large regional scale is the F1 score. The F1 score is a measure of the model's accuracy, precision, and recall, and it provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance. \n\nBased on the F1 score, the two-layer XGBoost model performed well. The F1 score of the verification set was 0.8157, indicating that the model achieved a good balance between precision and recall. This suggests that the model accurately classified the lithology types and had a low rate of false positives and false negatives. Overall, the model demonstrated a high level of accuracy and reliability in lithological classification."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The purpose of developing a new two-layer extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) lithology classification model using hyperspectral remote sensing technology is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of lithology classification. Traditional laboratory methods for analyzing rocks are limited in terms of sampling conditions and analytical techniques, resulting in high costs, low efficiency, and the inability to quickly obtain large-scale geological information. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology, on the other hand, allows for the classification and identification of lithology based on the spectral characteristics of rocks. By utilizing hyperspectral images as data sources and applying the XGBoost algorithm, this new model aims to provide fast detection, large coverage area, and environmental friendliness in lithological mapping at a large regional scale. The model is designed to enhance the extraction of rock classification information and improve the accuracy and reliability of lithological classification compared to traditional machine learning models."

The results of the study showed that the two-layer XGBoost model had a good lithological classification effect, robustness, and adaptability to small sample datasets. Compared with the traditional machine learning model, the two-layer XGBoost model showed superior performance. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the verification set were 0.8343, 0.8406, 0.8350, and 0.8157, respectively. This indicates that the two-layer XGBoost model achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score in classifying lithology."
