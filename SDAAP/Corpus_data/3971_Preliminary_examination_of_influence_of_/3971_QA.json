        "Output": "The machine learning algorithms, namely Linear Regression, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression, were used in the study to improve the accuracy of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) in coastal waters. These algorithms were applied to derive SDB using the remote sensing data obtained from Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 spectral bands. By analyzing the resulting SDB residuals, the study aimed to understand the relationship between the accuracy of SDB and the spatial distribution of Chlorophyll (Chl), Total Suspended Material (TSM), and Turbidity in coastal seawater. The study found that the erroneous SDB residuals and extreme values were predominantly located in regions with high or medium concentrations of optically active substances (OAS). By considering the influence of Chl, TSM, and Turbidity, the study suggested that the accuracy of SDB estimation could be further enhanced."

Based on the information provided in the related study, the spectral feature processing methods used in this study, namely Linear, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression, have been applied to improve the accuracy of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) in coastal waters. The study found that the resulting SDB residuals were analyzed in relation to Chlorophyll, Turbidity, and Total Suspended Material (TSM) in coastal seawater. It was observed that most of the erroneous SDB residuals and extreme values were distributed in high or medium concentrated optically active substance (OAS) regions.\n\nTherefore, based on the findings of this study, it can be inferred that the spectral feature processing methods used in this research have the potential to enhance the accuracy of SDB in coastal waters by considering the influence of Chlorophyll, Turbidity, and TSM."
