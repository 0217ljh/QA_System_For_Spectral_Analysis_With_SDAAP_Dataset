Specifically, the SVM model demonstrated higher prediction accuracy and stronger generalization for Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, NIPI, and RI. The SVM model had an R-V(2) value of 0.95 and an RMSEV value of 6.75 mg kg(-1) for Zn, an R-V(2) value of 0.95 and an RMSEV value of 8.04 mg kg(-1) for Cu, an R-V(2) value of 0.90 and an RMSEV value of 6.57 mg kg(-1) for Cr, an R-V(2) value of 0.86 and an RMSEV value of 4.14 mg kg(-1) for Pb, an R-V(2) value of 0.93 and an RMSEV value of 0.31 for NIPI, and an R-V(2) value of"

        "Output": "Yes, visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIR) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for predicting soil heavy metals and pollution indices in the related study. The study found that VNIR, with its advantages of rapid analysis, non-destructiveness, and low cost, performed significantly better than the traditional method of partial least squares regression (PLSR) in most cases. The nonlinear machine learning models, including cubist regression tree (Cubist), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and support vector machine (SVM), showed higher prediction accuracy and stronger generalization for the soil heavy metals (As, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cr) and the two pollution indices (Nemerow integrated pollution index, NIPI; potential ecological risk index, RI). The SVM model, in particular, demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy for most of the heavy metals and pollution indices. Therefore, VNIR can be considered a superior method for predicting soil heavy metals and pollution indices in this study."
