        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the extended-wavelength diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (EWDRS) technique shows promise as a potential diagnostic tool for non-invasive tumor margin delineation. The technique was able to differentiate between and classify different skin and tissue types in an in vivo pig model with an overall accuracy of 98.2%. The sensitivity and specificity for all skin and tissue types ranged between 96.4% and 100.0%. These results suggest that EWDRS has the potential to be superior to traditional diagnostic methods for non-invasive tumor margin delineation."
