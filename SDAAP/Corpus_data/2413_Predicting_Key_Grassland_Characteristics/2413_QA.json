        "Output": "The machine learning models, specifically Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), were used to predict the yield, dry matter content, sugars content, and nitrates content of grass from the hyperspectral dataset. The collected data from the hyperspectral radiometer, which measured the reflected natural light from the grass, was used as input for the PLSR models. The models were trained using the ground truth measurements of the grass qualities obtained either on-site or in a wet chemistry laboratory. By analyzing the spectral reflectance data from the grass, the PLSR models were able to establish substantial relationships between the spectral reflectance and the grass qualities. These relationships were quantified using the coefficient of determination (r(2)) values, which indicated the strength of the relationship between the spectral reflectance and each grass quality. The resulting predictive models could then be used to provide accurate and rapid predictions of the grass qualities to farmers, agronomists, and agricultural contractors."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of hyperspectral reflectance data is shown to be effective in accurately and rapidly predicting the yield, dry matter content, sugars content, and nitrates content of grass intended for ensilement. The experiments conducted in the East Midlands of Ireland during the Spring, Summer, and Autumn of 2019 utilized a bespoke sensor rig with a hyperspectral radiometer to measure the reflected natural light from grass samples. This data was then used to build Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) predictive models.\n\nComparing the results obtained from the hyperspectral reflectance data to traditional methods, it was found that substantial relationships exist between the spectral reflectance and the grass qualities. The correlation coefficients (r(2)) for yield, dry matter %, sugar content, and nitrates were 0.62, 0.54, 0.54, and 0.50, respectively. These values indicate a strong relationship between the hyperspectral data and the grass qualities.\n\nThis suggests that hyperspectral reflectance data can provide accurate and rapid predictions of grass qualities, making it a valuable tool for farmers, agronomists, and agricultural contractors."
