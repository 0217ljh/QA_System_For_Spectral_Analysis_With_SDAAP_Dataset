        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the method's performance in the related study was the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). These metrics measure the average difference between the predicted LAI values and the actual LAI values obtained from field measurements. \n\nThe MAE and RMSE values provide an indication of the accuracy of the predictions made by the stacking learning (SL) model. In the related study, the SL model incorporating the three-source data combination (MSI, SAR, and DEM) resulted in a reduction in MAE and RMSE compared to using only optical images. \n\nThe study found that the addition of SAR and DEM images reduced the MAE and RMSE by 26% and 18%, respectively, in Xingguo, and by 12% and 8%, respectively, in Gandong. Furthermore, the combination of all images (MSI, SAR, and DEM) resulted in the best prediction performance, with a decrease in MAE and RMSE by 71% and 64%, respectively, in Xingguo, and by 68% and 59%, respectively, in Gandong."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers optimized the individual machine learning algorithms by determining the best number and type of base learners through a comparative analysis, ensuring that too many or too few base learners were not used to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy. They also calibrated and selected the optimal meta learner to improve the accuracy of LAI estimation."

Furthermore, when all three sources of data (MSI, SAR, and DEM) were combined, the SL model had the best prediction performance. The SL model was found to be more robust and accurate than conventional individual machine learning models, with a decrease in MAE and RMSE of 71% and 64%, respectively, in Xingguo, and 68% and 59%, respectively, in Gandong. Therefore, the integration of SAR and DEM data using the SL model significantly improved the prediction accuracy of forest LAI in heterogeneous subtropical forests with complex terrain."
