        "Output": "The machine learning models were utilized in the development of multivariate calibration models for the determination of minor elements in steel using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) through a series of steps. \n\nFirst, data pretreatment was performed to preprocess the LIBS spectra acquired from steel samples. This step involves cleaning and normalizing the data to remove any noise or inconsistencies.\n\nNext, feature selection was carried out using the SelectKBest algorithm. This algorithm helps identify the most relevant features or variables in the data that are strongly correlated with the concentrations of the minor elements (such as Mn, Cr, and Ni) in the steel.\n\nOnce the relevant features were selected, a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) regression model was trained. The BPNN is a type of artificial neural network that uses a feedforward algorithm to learn and make predictions based on the input data.\n\nThe machine learning models, specifically the BPNN, were trained using the selected features and the corresponding concentrations of the minor elements in the steel. The models learned the patterns and relationships between the input features and the target concentrations, enabling them to make accurate predictions.\n\nThe developed multivariate calibration models, based on the machine learning approach, were then compared with the univariate models to assess their analytical performance.

        "Output": "The machine learning approach, specifically the development of multivariate calibration models using a back-propagation neural network (BPNN), shows improved analytical performance compared to traditional univariate regression models for the determination of minor elements in steel using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). \n\nThe past study states that univariate regression models can sometimes result in calibration models with modest analytical performances. In contrast, the multivariate models developed using the machine learning approach demonstrate higher efficiency in calibration and prediction with LIBS spectra acquired from steel samples.\n\nThe analytical performances of the multivariate models are compared with those obtained from the univariate models. The multivariate models show improved prediction trueness (relative error of prediction) and precision (relative standard deviation) for the determination of the minor elements (Mn, Cr, and Ni) in steel. The respective values for prediction trueness and precision are 1.13%, 2.85%, 7.20% (for Mn, Cr, Ni) and 6.68%, 3.96%, 6.52% (for Mn, Cr, Ni) under the used experimental conditions and measurement protocol.\n\nTherefore, the machine learning approach, specifically the use of multivariate calibration models with a BPNN, outperforms traditional univariate"
