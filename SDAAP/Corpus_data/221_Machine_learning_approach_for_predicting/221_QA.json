        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to predict crude oil stability was diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). DOSY measures the diffusion properties of different constituents in the crude oil sample, which can provide insights into their stability. By coupling DOSY with statistical multi-way analysis (MWA) and machine learning (ML) methods, the researchers were able to accurately predict crude oil stability and other important parameters relevant to the petroleum industry."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The statistical multi-way analysis (MWA) and machine learning (ML) methods coupled with diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) were highly effective in predicting crude oil stability and classifying crude oils of different origin. \n\nBy using MWA with the TUCKER3 decomposition model for a set of DOSY NMR spectra, the principal components were determined, which described 99.89% of the total variance. The reduced space of the first 3 principal components was then used for sample classification, successfully identifying similar samples. \n\nFurthermore, ML multivariate linear regression was carried out to model crude oil stability in relation to DOSY NMR spectra and other measured properties. The models obtained through ML showed exceptionally good correlations for the complex mixtures of crude oils, accurately predicting crude oil stability and other important parameters relevant to the petroleum industry. \n\nOverall, the combination of MWA, ML, and DOSY NMR spectroscopy proved to be a robust and effective approach for predicting crude oil stability and classifying crude oils based on their composition, stability, density, and diffusion properties."
