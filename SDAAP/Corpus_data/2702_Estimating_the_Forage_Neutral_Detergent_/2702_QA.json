        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for estimating NDF in alpine grassland during 2016-2019 is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the relative root mean square error (RMSE). The models based on first derivative (FD) spectra achieved an R-2 between 0.44 and 0.51, and an RMSE between 4.31% and 4.61%. On the other hand, the models based on original spectra (OR), log transformation (Log), and continuum removal (CR) spectra had an R-2 between 0.35 and 0.46, and an RMSE between 4.39% and 4.92%. The best model was the random forest (RF) model based on FD-Log-vegetation indices (VIs)-environmental factors (EFs), which had an R-2 of 0.62 and an RMSE of 3.98%. Overall, the models performed moderately well in estimating NDF, with the FD spectra-based models showing relatively better accuracy compared to other spectral transformations."

This model had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.62 and a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.98%. \n\nComparatively, the other models had lower estimation accuracies. The models based on original spectra (OR), log transformation (Log), and continuum removal (CR) spectra had R-2 values between 0.35 and 0.46, and RMSE values between 4.39% and 4.92%. \n\nTherefore, the RF model outperformed the ANN and SVM models in estimating NDF using hyperspectral data and environmental factors during the specified time period."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of hyperspectral data and environmental factors in estimating the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content in alpine grassland is compared to traditional methods in this study. The traditional methods of measuring NDF are described as time-consuming and laborious. On the other hand, hyperspectral remote sensing, combined with machine learning algorithms, offers a more efficient and accurate approach.\n\nThe study evaluates NDF using hyperspectral data and environmental factors from 2016 to 2019. Three machine learning algorithms, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), are used to construct models for estimating NDF.\n\nThe results of the study indicate that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, a method for dimension reduction, effectively selects important variables for estimating NDF. The models based on first derivative (FD) spectra show better estimation accuracy (coefficient of determination (R-2) between 0.44 and 0.51, relative root mean square error (RMSE) between 4.31% and 4.61%) compared to models based on original spectra (OR), log transformation (Log), and continuum removal (CR) spectra (R-2 between 0.35 and 0.46.
