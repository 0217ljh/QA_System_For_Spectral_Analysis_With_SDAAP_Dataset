        "Output": "Yes, the spectral information-only approach using a small window size CNN can be considered superior to traditional methods such as ANN, SVM, and RF in landslide mapping in the Rasuwa district in Nepal. According to the study, the accuracy assessment showed that the small window size CNN achieved the best result with a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) of 78.26%. This indicates that the CNN method outperformed the other traditional methods in accurately detecting landslides in the highly landslide-prone Rasuwa district."
