        "Output": "The metric chosen in the research was the fatty acid compositions obtained from blending different proportions of cottonseed oil (CSO), canola oil (CO), and soybean oil (SO) with olive oil (OO). This metric was used to evaluate the adulteration of OO. \n\nThe research used machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree (DT), and neural network algorithm for classification and regression analysis. The highest accuracy values for classification were obtained using the SVM method, with values of 0.946, 0.964, and 0.982 for OO-CO, OO-SO, and OO-CSO mixtures, respectively. \n\nIn terms of regression analysis, the errors were computed as 0.005, 0.005, and 0.002, respectively, using the neural network algorithm. \n\nBased on these results, the chosen metric of fatty acid compositions, along with the machine learning algorithms, proved to be effective in revealing olive oil adulteration. The high accuracy values and low errors indicate that this metric can go a long way in detecting and quantifying the adulteration of olive oil with other vegetable oils."
