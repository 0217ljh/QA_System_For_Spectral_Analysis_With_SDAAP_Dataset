Overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. In this case, it indicates the percentage of correctly detected ocean plastics out of all the samples.\n\nThe overall accuracy metric provides a good measure of the algorithms' performance in terms of correctly identifying ocean plastics."

The related study specifically focuses on the detection of ocean plastics using the mentioned technologies. Therefore, it is unclear whether the same framework and algorithms can be applied to detect other types of marine pollution."
