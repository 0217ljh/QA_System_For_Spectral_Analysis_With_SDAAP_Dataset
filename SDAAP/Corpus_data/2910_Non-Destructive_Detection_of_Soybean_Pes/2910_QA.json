        "Output": "Yes, the A-ResNet meta-learning model can be used as a superior alternative to traditional detection methods for accurately and efficiently detecting the leguminivora glycinivorella matsumura pest in soybean. The model combines the ResNet network with Attention to obtain feature vectors that better express the samples, improving the performance of the model. Additionally, the classifier is designed as a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) to reduce overfitting. The use of Layer Normalization instead of Batch Normalization and the Label Smooth method further enhance the training stability and prediction performance of the model. The experimental results showed that the A-ResNet meta-learning model achieved an accuracy of 94.57 +/- 0.19%, enabling rapid and accurate nondestructive detection of the pest. This provides theoretical support for the intelligent detection of soybean pests."
