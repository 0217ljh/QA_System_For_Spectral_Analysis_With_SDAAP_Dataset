        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate and compare the estimation accuracy of the BRR, SVR, and PLSR models is the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (rice yield in this case) that can be explained by the independent variables (rice canopy spectrum data, crop growth parameters, and crop nutrient intake data). The best result can reach 0.94."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The results of the study contribute to the understanding of the superiority of spectroscopic methods over traditional methods in monitoring rice yield using hyperspectral remote sensing technology in several ways:\n\n1. Prompt adjustment of cultivation management methods: By using hyperspectral remote sensing technology, the study was able to obtain rice canopy hyperspectral data, crop population growth parameters, and crop nitrogen nutrient intake data. This information allowed for the prompt adjustment of cultivation management methods, such as fertilization, based on the specific needs of the rice crop. Traditional methods may not provide such detailed and timely information, making it difficult to make accurate adjustments.\n\n2. Accurate estimation of rice yield: The study used three machine learning algorithms (BRR, SVR, and PLSR) to establish yield estimate models based on different data sources. The results showed that the BRR and SVR methods were more suitable for yield monitoring, with better performance in different periods and different parameter combinations. These models, based on hyperspectral data, crop growth parameters, and crop nutrient intake data, provided accurate estimations of rice yield. Traditional methods, which rely on manual observations and measurements, may not be as accurate or efficient in estimating yield."
