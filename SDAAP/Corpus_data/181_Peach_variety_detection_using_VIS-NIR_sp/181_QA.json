        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the research on classifying peach varieties based on VIS-NIR spectra, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was used. The CNN was constructed and trained using a VIS-NIR spectra database containing five kinds of peaches. The network model obtained through training was then employed to predict the testing set data. The accuracy of the models based on deep learning, specifically the one-dimensional CNN, reached 100% in the validation dataset and 94.4% in the test dataset. This indicates that the CNN was successful in distinguishing peach varieties using VIS-NIR spectroscopy."
