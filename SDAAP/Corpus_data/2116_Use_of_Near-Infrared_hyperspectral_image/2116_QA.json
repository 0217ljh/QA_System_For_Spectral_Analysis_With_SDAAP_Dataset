The study reports an accuracy of 87.14% in the learning image and an accuracy of 98.73% in the validation image. Therefore, the metric used in the study can go up to 98.73% accuracy in identifying moldy peanuts."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed method using NIR hyperspectral images can effectively identify moldy peanuts and reduce the risk of human ingestion of toxic carcinogens from moldy peanuts. The study used Near-Infrared (NIR) hyperspectral images to identify the moldy peanuts by selecting sensitive bands through Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in the spectral dimension. The marker-controlled watershed algorithm was then used to segment the images into kernel-scale objects in spatial dimensions. The results showed that the proposed method had an accuracy of 87.14% in learning image and 98.73% in validation image, indicating its effectiveness in identifying moldy peanuts. By efficiently identifying and separating moldy peanuts from healthy ones before entering the food chain, the risk of human ingestion of toxic carcinogens from moldy peanuts can be reduced."
