        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the matching accuracy of the traditional algorithms is the similarity degree of matching spectra. The average matching accuracy achieved using this metric is 65% (min = 33.68%) when the pure oil spectra (infinite thickness) are used as the database, and 85% (max = 98.66%) when the average oil spectra (different thickness) are used as the database."

        "Output": "The identifying accuracy of the machine learning (ML) model is nearly 100%, which is significantly higher than the average matching accuracy of traditional algorithms. The traditional algorithms achieved an average matching accuracy of 65% (min = 33.68%) when using pure oil spectra as the database and 85% (max = 98.66%) when using average oil spectra with different thicknesses as the database. Therefore, the ML model outperforms the traditional algorithms in accurately classifying oil types based on the measured spectra using the self-developed LIF-LiDAR system."
