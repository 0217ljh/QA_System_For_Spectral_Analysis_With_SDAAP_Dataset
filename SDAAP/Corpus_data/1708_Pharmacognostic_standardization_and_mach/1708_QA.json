        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, it can be inferred that the spectroscopic methods used in the study, specifically Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), were effective in distinguishing between Akebia quinata (Thunb.) Decne. and Akebia trifoliata (Thunb.) Koidz. The FTIR spectroscopy fingerprint identified nine characteristic absorption peaks of the secondary metabolites of both varieties. This suggests that FTIR spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for distinguishing between the two Akebia species. However, it is important to note that the text does not explicitly compare the spectroscopic methods to traditional methods, so further research and comparison may be necessary to make a definitive conclusion."
