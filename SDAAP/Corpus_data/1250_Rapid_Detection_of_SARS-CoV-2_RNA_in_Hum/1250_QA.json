        "Output": "In the related study, a deep learning algorithm based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) was developed and used to classify positive and negative specimens for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The algorithm was trained using a dataset consisting of 40 positive specimens and 120 negative specimens. The RNN model was designed to analyze the SERS spectra of human nasopharyngeal swab (HNS) specimens collected after RNA hybridization. \n\nBy analyzing the SERS peaks identified in the spectra, the deep learning algorithm was able to accurately classify the specimens as either positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall accuracy of the algorithm in classifying the training dataset was reported to be 98.9%.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the algorithm, a blind test was conducted using 72 specimens. The RNN model achieved a 97.2% accuracy in predicting positive specimens and a 100% accuracy in predicting negative specimens during this blind test. \n\nThe entire detection process, including specimen analysis and classification, was completed within 25 minutes, indicating the potential of the DNA-functionalized AgNR array SERS sensor combined with the deep learning algorithm as a rapid point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostic platform."
