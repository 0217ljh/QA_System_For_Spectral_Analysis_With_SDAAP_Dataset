        "Output": "Yes, the developed technique based on spectral signatures of blood samples can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods in accurately differentiating between women with recurrent miscarriage and healthy individuals. The article states that the developed technique was able to differentiate recurrent miscarriage and control patients with an accuracy of 100% using a Fourier transform infrared region corresponding to lipids. This indicates that the technique is highly accurate in distinguishing between the two groups. Additionally, the study presents preliminary results from the first prospective clinical validation study of its kind, further supporting the potential of this technique as a superior alternative."
