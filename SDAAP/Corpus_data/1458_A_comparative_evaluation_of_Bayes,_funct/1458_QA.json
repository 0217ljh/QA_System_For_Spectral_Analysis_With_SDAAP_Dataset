        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning algorithms were used to discriminate between different potato lines and varieties based on selected fluorescence spectroscopic data. The potato tubers from two breeding lines (S 617 and S 716) and two varieties (Trezor and Sante) were examined. Various machine learning algorithms from different groups were employed for discrimination analysis. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated by comparing average accuracies, confusion matrices, and several evaluation metrics such as F-Measure, Precision, PRC Area, ROC Area, and MCC. The results showed that the SMO, Naive Bayes, Hoeffding Tree, Multi Class Classifier, PART, and IBk algorithms achieved very high average accuracies, up to 95%. Some models built using these algorithms were able to distinguish potato lines and varieties with an accuracy of up to 100%, and the evaluation metrics reached a value of 1.000."
