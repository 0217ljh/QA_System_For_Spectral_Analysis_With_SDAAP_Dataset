        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms in estimating chl-a and chl-b contents was the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). The RPD values for deep belief nets (DBN) were consistently larger than 1.4, with ranges of 1.49-4.92 for chl-a and 1.48-5.10 for chl-b. This suggests that the DBN algorithm is reliable and can be used effectively for estimating chl-a and chl-b contents."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the present study, three different common machine learning algorithms, namely random forests, support vector machines, and deep belief nets, were compared. The comparison aimed to evaluate their performance in estimating the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and chlorophyll-b (chl-b) contents of shade-grown tea leaves using hyperspectral remote sensing. \n\nThe performance of each algorithm was assessed based on the ratios of performance to deviation (RPDs). The RPDs of deep belief nets (DBN) were consistently larger than 1.4 for both chl-a and chl-b estimation. The specific ranges of RPD were 1.49-4.92 for chl-a and 1.48-5.10 for chl-b. These results indicate that DBN is a unique algorithm that can reliably be used for the estimation of chl-a and chl-b contents in shade-grown tea leaves using hyperspectral remote sensing."

The ratios of performance to deviation (RPDs) for DBN were consistently larger than 1.4, indicating that DBN is a reliable algorithm for accurately estimating the chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b contents."
