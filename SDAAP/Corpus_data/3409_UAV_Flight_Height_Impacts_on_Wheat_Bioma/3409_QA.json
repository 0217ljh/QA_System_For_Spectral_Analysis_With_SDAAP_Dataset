        "Output": "The researchers assessed the impacts of flight height and integration of multiscale sensing information on wheat aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation using optical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing by conducting multispectral UAV flight missions at different heights (30, 60, 90, and 120 m) during the wheat grain filling phase in 2018 and 2019. They used the UAV-based crop surface model (CSM), spectral indices, texture indices, and their combinations as inputs for machine learning models such as deep convolutional neural network (DCNN with AlexNet architecture), random forest, and support vector machine. They compared the estimation accuracy of AGB at different flight heights and evaluated the performance of the models when integrating data from different heights. They also analyzed the sensitivity of different sensing information (CSM, spectral indices, and textures) to flight height and assessed the impact of flight height on the accuracy of AGB estimation for both machine learning and DCNN models."

Additionally, the integration of multiscale textures, derived from images with moderate spatial resolutions, was found to be optimal for grain-filling wheat AGB estimation."
