        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction ability in related study is the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect prediction and 0 indicating no predictive ability. The R-2 values obtained for the prediction of total soluble solids content (TSS) and springiness were 0.82 and 0.72, respectively, indicating a very good prediction ability for these parameters. However, for hardness and chewiness, the R-2 values were lower at 0.50 and 0.53, indicating a less accurate prediction. No satisfactory calibration model could be established for cohesiveness, suggesting that the NIR spectra were not able to accurately predict this textural parameter."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers used non-destructive NIR spectroscopy and machine learning techniques to predict the texture parameters and total soluble solids content (TSS) in intact berries by building artificial neural networks (ANNs) and applying partial least squares (PLS) regressions. They obtained multivariate models by eliminating uninformative spectral ranges, which improved the prediction ability. The models showed a very good prediction for TSS and springiness, with R-2 values of 0.82 and 0.72, respectively. They also obtained qualitative models for hardness and chewiness, with R-2 values of 0.50 and 0.53, respectively. However, they could not establish a satisfactory calibration model between the NIR spectra and cohesiveness. This analysis was the first time a complete textural analysis of intact grape berries was performed using NIR spectroscopy without any prior knowledge of the berry density class."

        "Output": "The combination of NIR spectroscopy and machine learning techniques showed a better prediction ability compared to traditional methods in accurately predicting the texture parameters and total soluble solids content (TSS) in intact berries. The multivariate models obtained through artificial neural networks (ANNs) and partial least squares (PLS) regressions demonstrated a very good prediction for TSS and springiness, with R-squared values of 0.82 and 0.72, respectively. Qualitative models were also obtained for hardness and chewiness, with R-squared values of 0.50 and 0.53. However, no satisfactory calibration model could be established for cohesiveness. This approach allowed for a complete textural analysis of intact grape berries without the need for prior knowledge of the berry density class, eliminating the time-consuming berry-sorting step required in traditional methods."
