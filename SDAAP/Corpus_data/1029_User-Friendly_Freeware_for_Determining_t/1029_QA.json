        "Output": "The purpose of using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and a machine learning model in the study on lithium-ion cell aging is to accurately determine the composition of the electrolyte. By analyzing the FTIR measurements of electrolyte samples, the machine learning model can predict the mass ratio of each electrolyte component, such as LiPF6, EC, EMC, DMC, and DEC, within a certain error margin. This information is valuable in understanding the changes in the electrolyte during cell aging and can help improve the longevity of lithium-ion cells. Additionally, the model allows for the detection of unexpected species in the electrolyte, which may have a significant impact on cell performance. The model can be calibrated with a carefully prepared dataset and can be extended to other systems by adding more data and retraining."
