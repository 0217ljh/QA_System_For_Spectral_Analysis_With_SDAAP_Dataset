        "Output": "The results of comparing the accuracy and bias of the four machine learning algorithms in estimating AGC in different forest areas with varying levels of human activity showed that the boosted regression trees (BRT) algorithm had lower accuracies. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm produced considerably biased estimates. On the other hand, the random forest (RF) algorithm generally provided robust results."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of multi-temporal Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) derived spectral information can improve the estimation of aboveground carbon (AGC) in low biomass forests compared to traditional methods. The study explored the use of this data in Zagros forests and tested four machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, boosted regression trees, random forest, and multivariate adaptive regression splines) to estimate AGC. The results showed that the Landsat image acquired during the peak of the growing season provided the best AGC estimates for the undegraded forest site. Additionally, the study demonstrated the utility of applying the free Landsat 8 OLI dataset to AGC estimation, particularly in non-commercial forests in developing countries with limited management budgets."
