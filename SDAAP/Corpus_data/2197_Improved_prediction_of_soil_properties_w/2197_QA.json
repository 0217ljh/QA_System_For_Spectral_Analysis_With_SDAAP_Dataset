        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning algorithms were used to pursue high-performance regression models for soil fertility parameters. Specifically, Multi-target Regression (MTR) methods were employed to handle soil samples analyzed by EDXRF, which presented difficulties of identification due to the complexity of the soil EDXRF spectra."

        "Output": "Yes, the proposed Multi-target Stacked Generalisation (MTSG) method can be considered superior to the traditional Single-target Regression method in predicting multiple parameters of soil fertility using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The study mentioned in the text compared MTSG and 5 other Multi-target Regression (MTR) methods with the Single-target Regression method. The results showed that the MTR methods, including MTSG, outperformed the Single-target Regression method by reducing the predictive error for 5 parameters. MTSG specifically obtained the lowest error for phosphorus, total organic carbon, and cation exchange capacity. Therefore, the MTSG method can be considered superior in predicting multiple parameters of soil fertility compared to the traditional Single-target Regression method."
