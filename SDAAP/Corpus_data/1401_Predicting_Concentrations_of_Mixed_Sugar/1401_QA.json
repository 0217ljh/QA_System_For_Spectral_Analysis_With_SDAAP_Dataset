        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning algorithms were utilized in combination with plasmonic surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) to enhance the detection and discrimination of glucose concentrations in complex aqueous environments using plasmonic nanoantenna-based sensors. The obtained spectra from aqueous solutions of mixtures of different saccharides were analyzed via principal component analysis (PCA), which is a machine learning algorithm. PCA allowed for the identification of specific vibrational fingerprints of the mono- and disaccharides, enhancing the discriminative power of the sensor. By training the machine learning algorithm with known concentrations and compositions of saccharides, the sensor was able to detect concentrations as low as 1 g/L, which is at the physiological level. Additionally, the machine learning algorithm enabled the reliable discrimination of saccharide concentrations and compositions in mixed solutions containing all five mono- and disaccharides simultaneously. Overall, the combination of plasmonic SEIRA spectroscopy and PCA using machine learning algorithms improved the detection and discrimination of glucose concentrations in complex aqueous environments."
