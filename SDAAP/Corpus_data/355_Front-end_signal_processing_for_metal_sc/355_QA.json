The effectiveness of the preprocessing methods in reducing the information-theoretic distance between static and moving samples was significant, with a classification accuracy greater than 95.5% for all five metal types. This was a significant improvement compared to the 91.2% accuracy obtained without preprocessing."

        "Output": "The preprocessing steps of baseline removal (BR) and root-mean-square-based normalization (BR-RMSN) effectively compensate for the potentially large fluctuations observed under dynamic conditions in the proposed front-end signal processing scheme for classifying spectra of metal scraps via LIBS by reducing the information-theoretic distance between static and moving samples.\n\nBaseline removal is the first preprocessing step, which removes the baseline or the continuous background signal from the spectrum. This helps to eliminate any systematic noise or interference that may be present in the spectrum, such as ambient light or electronic noise. By removing the baseline, the fluctuations caused by these external factors are minimized, allowing for a more accurate analysis of the emission lines.\n\nThe second preprocessing step is root-mean-square-based normalization (BR-RMSN). This step normalizes the spectrum by dividing each data point by the root mean square (RMS) value of the spectrum. This normalization technique helps to compensate for the potentially large fluctuations observed under dynamic conditions. By dividing each data point by the RMS value, the amplitude of the spectrum is normalized, reducing the impact of fluctuations in intensity caused by variations in the laser beam or sample movement.\n\nBy applying these two preprocessing steps, the proposed scheme effectively compensates for the potentially large fluctuations observed under dynamic conditions. The baseline removal eliminates systematic noise"

The experimental results show that the proposed prescreening method can detect outlier spectra with an accuracy of 99.0%, which is an improvement from 95.2% accuracy achieved by the conventional PLS-DA scheme."
