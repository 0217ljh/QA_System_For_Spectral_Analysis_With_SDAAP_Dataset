The algorithms, based on fuzzy rough set theory and using Gaussian and triangular membership functions, were able to select highly informative bands for classification. Compared to ranking methods, the proposed algorithms showed a promising improvement in classification accuracy. For example, with the Gaussian membership function, a subset of eight bands achieved an average accuracy of 99.11% after post-pruning. Additionally, the band selection algorithm using the Gaussian membership function was found to be more stable than the one using the triangular membership function under small perturbations. Overall, the information measure (IM) based band selection algorithm proved to be effective in obtaining satisfactory classification accuracy and providing stable results under perturbations."
