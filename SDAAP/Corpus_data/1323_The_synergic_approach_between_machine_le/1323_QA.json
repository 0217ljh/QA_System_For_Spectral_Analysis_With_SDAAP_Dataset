        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning model used in the study on predicting mass loss of cement samples is partial least squared regression (PLSR). This model contributes to the accuracy and speed of the predictions by providing a predictive ML model with satisfactory best validation scores. The reported ratio of performance to inter-quartile distance and root mean squared error were 12.89 and 0.337, respectively, indicating a reliable and accurate prediction. Additionally, the method suggests the possibility of optimizing and boosting the performance of the model by conducting a features selection approach. This approach disqualifies non-relevant wavelengths and focuses only on relevant ones, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the predictions."
