It consisted of two streams. The first stream included three multi-scale residual convolution blocks, which were mainly focused on extracting deep spectral features. The second stream was built using four multi-scale convolution blocks with a spatial attention module (AM). This stream aimed to capture the spatial characteristics and textural properties of the crops and their relation to surrounding crops.\n\nThe DAM was implemented to extract informative deep features by leveraging both the spectral and spatial characteristics of the Sentinel-2 time-series datasets. It consisted of two attention modules: the spectral attention module and the spatial attention module.\n\nThe spectral attention module investigated the behavior of crops during the growing season. It focused on capturing the spectral characteristics of the crops over time, allowing the network to understand the changes in spectral signatures as the crops grow and develop.\n\nThe spatial attention module, on the other hand, considered the neighborhood properties of the crops. It analyzed the textural characteristics and spatial relation of the crops to the surrounding crops."

        "Output": "The proposed framework utilizing spectroscopic methods, specifically a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a dual attention module (DAM), outperforms traditional methods in accurately mapping and classifying crop types using remote sensing data. Traditional machine learning methods have limitations in accurately mapping crop types and extents. However, the novel framework presented in the related study addresses this challenge by leveraging the spectral and spatial characteristics of Sentinel-2 time-series datasets.\n\nThe framework incorporates a dual attention module (DAM) that extracts informative deep features by considering both the spectral behavior of crops during the growing season and their neighborhood properties, such as textural characteristics and spatial relation to surrounding crops. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the crops and their classification.\n\nThe proposed network consists of two streams: one for deep feature extraction using convolution blocks and another for applying the DAMs. The spectral attention blocks in the first stream focus on extracting deep spectral features, while the spatial attention modules in the second stream consider the spatial characteristics of the crops.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, over 200,000 samples from six different crop types and three non-crop classes were collected for training and validation. The results demonstrated high overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 98.54% and 0."
