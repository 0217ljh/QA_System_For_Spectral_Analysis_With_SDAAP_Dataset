        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the NPP estimation models in the related study is the coefficient of determination (R2). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the NPP data that is explained by the model. In the related study, the R2 values ranged from 0.899 to 0.958 for the different models. The R2 value can range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the model and the observed data. Therefore, the R2 metric provides a measure of how well the models are able to estimate the NPP based on the input parameters."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No, the ground factor-based GBR model cannot be considered a superior spectroscopic method compared to the VIs x PAR-based model in this study. While the ground factor-based GBR model outperformed the VIs x PAR-based model in estimating maize daytime NPP, it is described as complex, highly time and labor-intensive, and highly destructive. Additionally, the ground factor-based GBR model could not reflect the variation of NPP in the maize canopy. On the other hand, the VIs x PAR-based GBR model could explain 89.9% of the daytime NPP and only required two parameters, VIs and PAR. Therefore, the VIs x PAR-based GBR model is considered a more practical and efficient method for estimating maize daytime NPP using UAV multispectral images in this study."
