This metric measures the average miss rate across different false positive rates on a logarithmic scale. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of the detector's performance across different operating points. The log-average miss rate can go as low as 9% for the proposed pedestrian detector with multi-spectral cameras, indicating a high level of accuracy in detecting pedestrians."

        "Output": "The different input options for the pedestrian detection instrument described in the related study are the color image, disparity map, thermal data, or any combination of these inputs. \n\nIn the feature extraction stage, when utilizing convolutional channel features, the first three convolutional layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network are used. These layers are cascaded with an AdaBoost classifier to extract features from the input data. \n\nIn the classification stage, the extracted features are used to classify the candidates generated from each image frame. The reconfigurable detector framework allows for separate feature extraction and classification stages, enabling flexibility in utilizing different input options for pedestrian detection."
