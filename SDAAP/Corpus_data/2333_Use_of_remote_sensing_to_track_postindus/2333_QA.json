        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictive power of the models for recognizing vegetation variability along the main gradients of species composition on postindustrial sites is the coefficient of determination (R-2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the DCA scores that can be explained by the predictors (multispectral satellite images and airborne laser scanning data). \n\nThe R-2 values obtained for the first two DCA axes were 0.393 and 0.443, indicating that the models were able to explain approximately 39.3% and 44.3% of the variability in species composition along these axes, respectively."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were used to build predictive models for recognizing vegetation variability along the main gradients of species composition on postindustrial sites. The researchers used detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to determine the main gradients of species composition. They then used multispectral satellite images and airborne laser scanning data as predictors to build the machine learning models of DCA scores. The models had good predictive power for the first two DCA axes, with R-2 values of 0.393 and 0.443, and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.571 and 0.526. However, the predictive power was low for the third and fourth DCA axes, with R-2 values of 0.216 and 0.064, and RMSE values of 0.513 and 0.361. The DCA scores obtained from the models were then used to prepare a vegetation map, which allowed for the distinction of different vegetation types and the identification of specific vegetation patches. This approach improved remote sensing-based vegetation surveys and can be used for planning future management."

The models had good predictive power for the first two gradients of species composition, as indicated by high R-2 values and low root mean square errors."
