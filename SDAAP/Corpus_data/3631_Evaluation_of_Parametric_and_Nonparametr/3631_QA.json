        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the regression models in estimating C-SPM is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the C-SPM values that can be explained by the regression model, with a value closer to 1 indicating a better fit. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted C-SPM values and the actual values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy.\n\nWhile the R-2 and RMSE metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the performance of the regression models, they have limitations in fully assessing C-SPM estimation accuracy. These metrics only provide an overall measure of the model's performance and do not capture potential biases or errors in specific regions or under different conditions. Additionally, these metrics do not provide information on the reliability or uncertainty of the estimated C-SPM values. Therefore, while the chosen metrics provide valuable insights into the performance of the regression models, further analysis and validation are necessary to fully assess the accuracy of C-SPM estimation."

        "Output": "The parametric and nonparametric regression algorithms were evaluated in estimating the concentration of suspended particulate matter (C-SPM) in lakes using data from Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field-of-view (WFV) satellites by simulating the imaging of turbid water. A total of 71 samples collected during four cruises were analyzed to determine the spectral reflectance and C-SPM in Poyang Lake. The evaluation compared the performance of different regression models, including the spectral ratio (SR) parametric regression model and the extreme learning machine (ELM) nonparametric regression model, along with other neural network-based algorithms such as backpropagation (BP), radial basis function (RBF), and cascade-forward neural network (CFNN) algorithms. The evaluation results showed that the SR parametric regression model and the ELM nonparametric regression model based on in situ SPM and spectral data performed relatively better than the other investigated models. The SR model achieved a high retrieval accuracy (R-2 = 0.901, RMSE = 8.22 mg center dot L-1) and the ELM model achieved a higher retrieval accuracy (R-2 = 0.903, RMSE = 8.05 mg center dot L-1)."

The SR model achieved a high retrieval accuracy with an R-2 value of 0.901 and an RMSE of 8.22 mg/L. It was able to effectively weaken and partially eliminate the effects of external factors, making it more sensitive in estimating C-SPM values. \n\nThe ELM model, on the other hand, achieved a higher retrieval accuracy compared to other neural network-based algorithms such as backpropagation (BP), radial basis function (RBF), and cascade-forward neural network (CFNN) algorithms. It had an R-2 value of 0.903 and an RMSE of 8.05 mg/L. The ELM model demonstrated a robust ability to accurately retrieve C-SPM values, making it suitable for both low and high turbidity conditions."
