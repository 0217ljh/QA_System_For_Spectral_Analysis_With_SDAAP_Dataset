This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (NTU in this case) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral regions). \n\nThe R-2 value obtained in the validation of the R-HM model was 0.99, which indicates a very high level of accuracy in predicting the NTU levels based on the spectral data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The Regional hybrid model (R-HM) incorporates machine learning techniques in the retrieval of NTU levels using remote sensing data by using a simple machine learning-based approach. The model allows for prior recognition of the NTU level concentration (high or low) before estimation. This means that the model is trained to identify and classify the NTU levels based on the spectral information obtained from the remote sensing data. The calibration step of the model highlighted that low and high NTUs are sensitive to different spectral regions, with the red part being the main controlling factor. The model uses this information to estimate the NTU levels based on the spectral data. The validation of the model showed satisfactory results, with a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.99). However, it was observed that high NTUs tend to be underestimated by the model, with a bias of -14%. Overall, the R-HM model utilizes machine learning techniques to effectively retrieve NTU levels from remote sensing data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the machine learning-based R-HM model can effectively retrieve NTU levels using remote sensing data. The study mentioned that the R-HM model allows for prior recognition of the NTU level concentration (high or low) before estimation. The calibration step showed that different spectral regions, particularly the red part, have a significant impact on the estimation of low and high NTUs. The validation of the R-HM model was satisfactory, with an R-2 value of 0.99. However, it was noted that high NTUs tend to be underestimated by the model, with a BIAS of -14%.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the R-HM model performed well, with a high R-2 value indicating a strong correlation between the estimated and actual NTU levels."
