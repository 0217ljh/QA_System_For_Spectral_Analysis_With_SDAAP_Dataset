        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the high-performance models achieved by machine learning algorithms for estimating nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll (Chl) content can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods in the nondestructive estimation of leaf N content in tea plants. These models, constructed using regression techniques and hyperspectral reflectance data, have demonstrated accuracy thresholds that meet the requirements for optimizing N fertilization input and reducing the environmental impact of agricultural N management. By accurately estimating leaf N content, these models enable tea farmers to optimize their N fertilization practices, ensuring that the plants receive the appropriate amount of nutrients without excessive use of fertilizers. This not only improves the efficiency of N management but also reduces the risk of environmental pollution caused by excess N application. Therefore, the use of machine learning algorithms for nondestructive estimation of leaf N content in tea plants fulfills the purpose of optimizing N fertilization input and reducing the environmental impact of agricultural N management."
