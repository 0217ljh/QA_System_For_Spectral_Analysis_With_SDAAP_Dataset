        "Output": "The researchers compared the accuracy of the two canopy radiative transfer models (RTMs) by evaluating their performance in estimating leaf area index (LAI) in mangrove forests. They assessed the accuracy of the models by calculating several metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Based on these metrics, they found that the PROSAIL RTM achieved the highest accuracy in estimating LAI in mangrove forests, with an RMSE of 0.13 m(2).m(-2), NRMSE of 9.57%, and MAE of 0.1 m(2).m(-2)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the AL-driven hybrid GPR model can be used to estimate leaf area index (LAI) in mangrove forests using Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance. The study investigated the potential of using radiative transfer models (RTM) combined with active learning (AL) to estimate LAI from Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance in the mangrove-dominated region of Ngoc Hien, Vietnam. The results showed that the AL-driven hybrid GPR model outperformed other approaches, such as the red-edge NDVI approach and the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) biophysical processor, in estimating mangrove LAI. This suggests that the AL-driven hybrid GPR model can be a reliable method for estimating LAI in mangrove forests using Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance."
