        "Output": "The role of the bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) based scale separation algorithm in the proposed multi-scale method for classifying coral reef habitats using CNN-SVM is to extract multi-scale information from the remote-sensing images of the coral reefs. This algorithm separates the different scales present in the images, allowing the CNN-SVM framework to fully learn and utilize the multi-scale characteristics of the coral reefs. By incorporating spectrum, texture, and BEMD-based scale separation, the proposed method is able to improve the accuracy and efficiency of classifying coral reef habitats compared to other methods."
