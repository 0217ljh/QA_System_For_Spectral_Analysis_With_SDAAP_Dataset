        "Output": "The researchers validated the predictive model by using multiple random splitting of the spectral data on the training and testing sets in a 60%:40% proportion to teach the SVM classifiers.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Terahertz spectroscopy and machine learning can be considered superior to traditional methods for automatically classifying paraffin-embedded prostate cancer tissue biopsy samples based on the Gleason scale. Past study used terahertz spectroscopy to measure absorption spectra of the tissue samples in the 0.2-1.5 THz range. Machine learning techniques, such as principal component analysis, support vector machine (SVM), and majority vote classification, were then applied to analyze the experimental data. It developed an original algorithm to reduce the influence of the plastic base of the paraffin block on the classification results. The predictive model created using SVM classifiers achieved 100% accuracy in classifying the samples from the testing set. This suggests that terahertz spectroscopy and machine learning can provide a highly accurate and automated method for classifying prostate cancer tissue samples based on the Gleason scale."
