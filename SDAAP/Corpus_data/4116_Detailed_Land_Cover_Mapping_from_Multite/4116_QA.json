        "input": "",
        "Output": "The presence of clouds can have an impact on the overall accuracy rates in the classification of high-resolution satellite data into detailed land cover classes, with a focus on crop types. In the study mentioned, experimental datasets of Landsat-8 (L8) images with gradually increased cloud cover were formed to assess this influence.\n\nThe related study states that without employing cloud masks and/or interpolation procedures, the classification accuracy was evaluated. The quantitative results showed that the overall accuracy rates differed within a range of less than 3% when comparing datasets with different levels of cloud cover.\n\nHowever, the study found that maps produced based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) were more accurate across class boundaries compared to the applied patch-based deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This suggests that the presence of clouds may have a greater impact on the accuracy of the CNN-based classification framework.\n\nFurthermore, the study indicated that employing all multitemporal images with up to 30% cloud cover resulted in relatively higher overall accuracy rates as well as the highest per-class accuracy rates. This suggests that including images with some cloud cover can improve the classification accuracy, possibly due to the additional temporal information captured by these images."
