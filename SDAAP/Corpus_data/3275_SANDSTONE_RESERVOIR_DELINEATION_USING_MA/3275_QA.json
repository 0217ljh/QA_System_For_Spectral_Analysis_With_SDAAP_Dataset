        "Output": "The use of Seismic Spectral Attributes (SSAs) and principal component analysis (PCA) provides an alternative approach to traditional seismic attribute visualizations controlled by gamma ray log data for the qualitative prediction of facies classification.\n\nIn the related study, SSAs were extracted and utilized for the spectral decomposition RGB Blending visualization. This technique allows for the identification and highlighting of sand bodies near the 1/4 wavelength, which is important for understanding the tuning phenomena in reservoirs.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional seismic attribute visualizations controlled by gamma ray log data are commonly used as a guidance for lithofacies classification. These visualizations may not directly capture the specific characteristics of sand bodies and their distribution within the reservoir.\n\nBy applying numerical values to several seismic attributes and performing PCA, the computational time and storage space required for analysis can be reduced. This allows for a more efficient and effective analysis of the data.\n\nThe combination of PCA and unsupervised clustering further enhances the facies classification process. This approach utilizes the principal component analysis of the original numerical seismic attributes values to obtain a facies map, which is then used for reservoir delineation."
