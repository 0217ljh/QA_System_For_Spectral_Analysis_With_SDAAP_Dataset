        "Output": "Yes, the developed Laser-HSI system using spectroscopic methods can be considered superior to traditional measurement systems for fast and large area measurements of Raman and fluorescence signals in sorting tasks and continuous quality monitoring. The system utilizes a 532 nm Nd:YAG laser and a standard pushbroom HSI camera, allowing for efficient and accurate measurements. Depending on the lens selected, the system can cover large areas or achieve high spatial resolutions. The system has been successfully used in various experiments, including the measurement and classification of different substances, the measurement of carotenoid distribution in a carrot slice, the classification of black polymer particles, and the localization of impurities on a piezoelectric actuator. The measurement data obtained with the Laser-HSI system were found to be in good agreement with reference measurements taken with a high-resolution Raman microscope. Additionally, the suitability of the measurements for classification using machine learning algorithms was demonstrated. Overall, the Laser-HSI system offers improved capabilities for complex quality control or sorting tasks where conventional HSI systems may fall short."
