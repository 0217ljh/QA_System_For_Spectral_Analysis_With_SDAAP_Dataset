        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of biophysical parameters estimates and resampling the annual time series on thermal time was found to be more effective in predicting corn yield compared to other methods using satellite and environmental data. The study found that when extrapolating to a different year from the ones covered by training samples, this approach increased the accuracy (measured by R2) on average by 0.25 to 0.42. In contrast, using calendar time and other information derived from the Sentinel-2 spectrum resulted in lower accuracy in yield prediction. Therefore, incorporating biophysical parameters estimates and resampling on thermal time proved to be a more reliable method for predicting corn yield using satellite and environmental data."
