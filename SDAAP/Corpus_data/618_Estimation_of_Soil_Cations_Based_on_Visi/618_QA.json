The results showed that the estimation effect for soil Mg2+ was significantly better than the other three elements (Ca2+, K+, and Na+), with an R-2 value of 0.90 and an RPIQ value of 3.84. The R-2 values for Ca2+, K+, and Na+ were 0.83, 0.83, and 0.85, respectively, with corresponding RPIQ values of 2.47, 2.58, and 2.63. These results indicate that the estimation models were relatively accurate, with the model for soil Mg2+ showing the highest accuracy."
