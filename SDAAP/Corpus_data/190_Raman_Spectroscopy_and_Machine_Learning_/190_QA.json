        "input": "",
        "Output": "The characteristic peak information of microplastics (MPs) was extracted and utilized using Raman spectroscopy technology. Raman spectroscopy is a technique that involves shining a laser on a sample and measuring the scattered light to obtain information about the molecular composition of the sample. MPs have unique fingerprint features in their Raman spectra, which can be used to identify and classify different types of MPs.\n\nBy analyzing the Raman spectra of MPs, the researchers were able to extract the characteristic peak information specific to each type of MP (PET, PVC, PP, PS, PC, PE). These characteristic peaks serve as markers that distinguish one type of MP from another. The researchers then used a sparse autoencoder (SAE) and soft-max classifier framework to train an algorithm to recognize and classify the MPs based on their characteristic peak information.\n\nThe trained algorithm was tested using MP samples from five different water environments (pure water, rain water, lake water, tap water, and sea water). The results showed that the average test accuracy of the algorithm was 99.1%, indicating that the proposed method successfully identified and classified the MP samples in different water environments."

The past study shows that the average test accuracy of the trained algorithm using Raman spectroscopy technology is as high as 99.1%, which is better than the 93.95% and 74.55% accuracy achieved by classical machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation (BP) neural network. This indicates that the proposed method is more accurate and reliable in identifying and classifying microplastic particles in various water environments."
