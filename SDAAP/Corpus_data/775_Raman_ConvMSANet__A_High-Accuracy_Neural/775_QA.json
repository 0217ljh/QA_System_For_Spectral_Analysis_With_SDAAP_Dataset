        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of the transformer network structure in the proposed Raman ConvMSANet model for blood and semen identification is to extract global feature relations from the Raman spectroscopy data. The transformer network utilizes the multihead self-attention mechanism to capture the dependencies between different parts of the input data, allowing the model to understand the overall relationships and patterns present in the spectra. However, it is mentioned that the multihead self-attention mechanism does not perform well in extracting local feature peaks. Therefore, in the Raman ConvMSANet model, the transformer network structure is combined with one-dimensional convolution to overcome this limitation and achieve more accurate identification results."
