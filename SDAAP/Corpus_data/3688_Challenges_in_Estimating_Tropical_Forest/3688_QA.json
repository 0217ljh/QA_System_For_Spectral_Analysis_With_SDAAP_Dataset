        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the developed software toolchain can be used to estimate top-of-canopy height (TCH) for countries other than Peru using high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Dove. The related study specifically mentions building a model for Peru and discussing the technical and scientific challenges involved in estimating TCH from Planet Dove satellite image features. Therefore, it is unclear whether the model can be directly applied to other countries without further modification or validation."
