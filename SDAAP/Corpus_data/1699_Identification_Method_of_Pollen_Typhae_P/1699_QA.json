        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction model in the research on developing a near-infrared identification method for CTP with different degrees of carbonization is test accuracy. The test accuracy measures the percentage of correctly predicted CTP samples with different degrees of carbonization. \n\nAccording to the experimental results, when the training set occupies 80%, the test accuracy of the proposed method is up to 95.4%. This means that the prediction model correctly identifies the degree of carbonization in 95.4% of the test samples. \n\nFurthermore, the proposed method shows robustness as the test accuracy remains higher than 90% when the proportion of the training set occupies more than 70%. Even when the proportion of the training set only occupies 10%, the prediction accuracy can still reach about 80%. \n\nOverall, the chosen metric of test accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the developed near-infrared identification method for CTP with different degrees of carbonization."

        "Output": "In the research on developing a near-infrared identification method for Carbonized Typhae Pollen (CTP) with different degrees of carbonization using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the voting mechanism, the weights of the pre-processing methods were allocated based on the accuracy and loss. The four different pre-processing methods were evaluated, and their prediction results were calculated. The accuracy and loss of each pre-processing method were taken into consideration to determine their respective weights. The weights were then used to combine the four prediction results and identify the CTP with different degrees of carbonization."

In comparison, the prediction accuracy of CNN, LDA, and SNV-LDA is lower, with improvements of 8.6%, 4.3%, and 2.6% respectively when using the proposed method.\n\nFurthermore, the proposed method is also robust. When the proportion of the training set occupies more than 70%, the test accuracy remains higher than 90%. Even when the proportion of the training set is as low as 10%, the prediction accuracy can still reach about 80%.\n\nTherefore, the proposed near-infrared identification method using CNN and the voting mechanism demonstrates superior prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods for distinguishing CTP with different degrees of carbonization."
