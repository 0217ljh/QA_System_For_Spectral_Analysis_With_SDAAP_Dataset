        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction performance in this study is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The coefficient of determination measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (soil texture content) that is predictable from the independent variables (spectral data). It ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model to the data. The root mean square error measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, with a lower value indicating a better fit of the model to the data.\n\nThe study found that the PCA-CNN model achieved a higher prediction precision compared to the PCA-PLSR model. Specifically, for clay content, the PCA-CNN model had an R-2 of 0.948 and 0.908, and an RMSE of 26.51 g/kg and 31.24 g/kg, respectively. This represents a 39.0% and 79.8% increase in R-2 and a 57% and 57.1% decrease in RMSE compared to the PCA-PLSR model."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the PCA-CNN model is higher compared to the PCA-PLSR model in predicting soil texture content using machine learning and unmixing techniques. The PCA-CNN model achieved a higher prediction precision than the PCA-PLSR model in both ASD and GF-5 data. Specifically, the clay content exhibited the highest predictive performance with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.948 and 0.908 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.51 g/kg and 31.24 g/kg, respectively. This represents a 39.0% and 79.8% increase in R-2 and a 57% and 57.1% decrease in RMSE compared to that of the PCA-PLSR model. The PCA-CNN model effectively captures nonlinear interactions between multiple spectral components and better models and fits spectral mixing processes, providing an alternative method for investigating the spatial distribution of soil texture."
