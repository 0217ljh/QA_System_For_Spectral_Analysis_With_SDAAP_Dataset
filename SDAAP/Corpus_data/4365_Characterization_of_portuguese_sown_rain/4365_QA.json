        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the performance of the models developed in the related study was the root mean square error (RMSE). The estimations of the models were found to be significantly low, especially in the random cross-validation approach (RN-CV). The RMSE values for all variables were relatively low, indicating that the models had good accuracy in estimating the pasture characteristics. For example, the RMSE for plant phosphorus (P) content was 0.71 g P kg(-1) in the test set with RN-CV, and the RMSE for standing biomass had the highest difference between cross-validation approaches, with values of 722 kg ha(-1) in RN-CV and 825 kg ha(-1) in LLYO-CV. Overall, the models showed good estimation accuracy for the pasture characteristics."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The choice of cross-validation approach had an influence on the estimation accuracy of different pasture characteristics in the study on sown biodiverse pastures rich in legumes (SBP) in Portugal using remote sensing and machine learning. \n\nThe results showed that the algorithms with the random cross-validation approach (RN-CV) had higher estimation accuracy for all pasture characteristics compared to the algorithms with the structured cross-validation approach (LLYO-CV). On average, the RN-CV approach had about 10% lower root mean square error (RMSE) and an R-squared value that was 85% higher than the LLYO-CV approach.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the LLYO-CV approach was designed to avoid overfitting and improve the generalization of the models. In each fold of the LLYO-CV approach, the model was tested on a farm and year that was not used for training. This helps to assess the performance of the model in a more realistic scenario.\n\nThe choice of cross-validation approach had varying influences on different pasture characteristics."
