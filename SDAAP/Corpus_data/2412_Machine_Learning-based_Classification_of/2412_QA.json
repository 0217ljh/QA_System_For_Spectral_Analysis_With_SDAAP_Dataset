        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the JSSSA and SNN techniques is the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient values. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples, while the Kappa coefficient measures the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of agreement by chance.\n\nThese metrics provide a quantitative measure of the classification accuracy and the level of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications."

        "Output": "The labeled/ground-truth datasets of snow were classified and evaluated in the study by using the JSSSA method, SNN, and SVM for hyperspectral classification. The performance of each technique was assessed based on overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient values. The JSSSA technique achieved the highest overall accuracy of 96.13% and a Kappa coefficient value of 0.95. The SNN technique achieved an overall accuracy of 92.40% and a Kappa coefficient value of 0.90. The SVM technique achieved an accuracy of 82.87%. These results indicate that the JSSSA method outperformed both the SNN and SVM techniques in terms of classification accuracy and reliability."

The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 82.87%. Therefore, the JSSSA technique outperforms both the SNN technique and the SVM model in terms of classification accuracy and agreement with the ground truth data."
