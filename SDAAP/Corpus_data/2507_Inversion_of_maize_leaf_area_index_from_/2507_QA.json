        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the hybrid inversion models (HIMs) in terms of LAI estimation is the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). \n\nThe R2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the LAI estimation that can be explained by the model. The closer the R2 value is to 1, the better the model's performance in accurately estimating LAI.\n\nThe RMSE value represents the average difference between the predicted LAI values and the actual LAI values. A lower RMSE value indicates a higher level of accuracy in the LAI estimation.\n\nThe NRMSE value is the RMSE value normalized by the mean LAI value. It provides a relative measure of the accuracy of the LAI estimation, allowing for comparison across different datasets or studies.\n\nBased on the results mentioned in the related study, the best performing hybrid inversion model (GPR-AL-HIM) achieved an R2 value of 0.86 and an RMSE value of 0.30."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The active learning (AL) algorithm plays a role in optimizing the hybrid inversion models (HIMs) for maize LAI estimation using UAV hyperspectral and multispectral data. It is used to improve the accuracy of the model by selecting the most informative samples for training. The AL algorithm actively selects samples that are expected to provide the most valuable information for model training, reducing the need for a large number of labeled samples. By incorporating AL into the HIMs, the accuracy of the LAI estimation model is effectively improved."

        "Output": "Yes, the inclusion of active learning (AL) in the hybrid inversion models (HIMs) can effectively improve the accuracy of maize LAI estimation using UAV hyperspectral and multispectral data. The study found that the Gaussian process regression-based HIM with AL (GPR-AL-HIM) obtained the best performance in LAI estimation, with an R2 value of 0.86, RMSE of 0.30, and NRMSE of 10.16%. This indicates that the AL algorithm optimized the HIMs and enhanced the accuracy of the LAI estimation."
