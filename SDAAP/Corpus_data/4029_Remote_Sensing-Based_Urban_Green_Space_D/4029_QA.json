        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed model for urban green space detection is the F1 score. The F1 score is a measure of the model's accuracy that takes into account both precision and recall. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of the model's performance.\n\nIn the related study, the proposed model achieved an F1 score of 0.93. This indicates that the model has a high level of accuracy in detecting urban green space. A score of 0.93 suggests that the model has a good balance between precision and recall, meaning it can accurately identify green space while minimizing false positives and false negatives.\n\nOverall, the F1 score of 0.93 demonstrates that the proposed model performs well in detecting urban green space, providing reliable and accurate information for urban land-use planning and management."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed intelligent model combines the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) and support vector machines (SVM) to contribute to the detection of urban green space at a regional scale using remote sensing data. \n\nThe model utilizes remotely sensed data obtained from the Sentinel 2 satellite in the study area of Da Nang city, Vietnam. It employs SVM to create a decision boundary that separates statistical measurements of remote sensing data into two categories: green space and non-green space. \n\nTo optimize the SVM training phase, the MPA metaheuristic is used to identify the appropriate set of SVM hyperparameters, including the penalty coefficient and the kernel function parameter. This optimization process helps improve the accuracy and performance of the model.\n\nThe model processes information provided by all of the Sentinel 2 satellite's spectral bands, rather than relying solely on vegetation indices. This comprehensive approach allows the model to deliver better performance in detecting urban green space.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a good classification accuracy rate of approximately 93%, an F1 score of 0.93, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.98."
