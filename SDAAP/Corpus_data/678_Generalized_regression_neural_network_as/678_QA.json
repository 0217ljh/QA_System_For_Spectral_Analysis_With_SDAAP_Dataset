        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the investigation, terahertz (THz) techniques were used in combination with machine learning methods, specifically the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN), to measure the benzoic acid (BA) content in wheat flour. The absorption coefficient of the THz spectra was analyzed, and it was observed that the absorption peak occurred at 1.94 THz and increased with the content of BA additive. The THz spectra were then transformed into orthogonal principal component analysis (PCA) scores, which served as the input vectors for the GRNN and BPNN models. The GRNN model, with three PCA scores and a spread value of 0.2, was found to be the most successful for quality control of wheat flour, with a correlation coefficient of prediction (r(p)) of 0.85 and a root mean square error of prediction of 0.10%. This suggests that the combination of THz technique and GRNN has significant potential for accurately analyzing the BA additive in wheat flour."
