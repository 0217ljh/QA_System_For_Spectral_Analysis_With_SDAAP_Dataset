        "Output": "The metric chosen for monitoring mangrove stoichiometry using hyperspectral data is the performance ranking of the machine learning models. The study compared three models: random forest (RF), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and partial least squares (PLS). The performance ranking of the models was determined based on the simple cross-validation VEcv, the ratio of performance to deviation, and the root mean square error (RMSE).\n\nThe study found that the PLS model had the highest performance ranking, followed by the RF model, and the BPNN model was the least effective. The PLS model had a VEcv greater than or equal to 0.60 and an RMSE less than 40, indicating its suitability for hyperspectral inversion modeling of mangrove ecological stoichiometries.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of model performance ranking, with PLS being the optimal model, can go a long way in the monitoring of mangrove stoichiometry using hyperspectral data. It provides a methodological basis for long-term and large-scale dynamic monitoring of mangrove ecological stoichiometries and mangrove restoration quality."

        "Output": "Machine learning models, specifically random forest (RF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN), were utilized in the investigation of mangrove stoichiometry and its significance for mangrove restoration. These models, along with partial least squares (PLS), were established using the original spectral data as independent variables. The models were used to analyze the chemical elements (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.) in mangroves and investigate their physiological activities, such as vegetation growth, development, and material metabolism.\n\nThe models were used to monitor the growth status of two mangrove species, Kandelia candel (KC) and Aegiceras corniculatum (AC), in the Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve. By comparing the simple cross-validation VEcv, the ratio of performance to deviation, and the root mean square error (RMSE), the optimal model was selected. The results showed that the contents of total phosphorus and total nitrogen decreased gradually, while the content of total carbon increased gradually with an increase in age at restoration.\n\nThe use of machine learning models, particularly PLS, RF, and BPNN, allowed for the inversion modeling of the ecological stoichiometries of KC and AC."

        "Output": "The effectiveness of hyperspectral modeling in monitoring the growth status and ecological stoichiometries of mangrove species is compared to traditional methods in the given related study. According to the related study, the results showed that hyperspectral modeling can effectively invert the ecological stoichiometries of the studied mangrove species, Kandelia candel (KC) and Aegiceras corniculatum (AC). This means that hyperspectral modeling can accurately determine the chemical elements (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.) in the mangroves, which is crucial for understanding their physiological activities, such as vegetation growth, development, and material metabolism.\n\nIn terms of monitoring the growth status and ecological stoichiometries, the related study also mentions the establishment of two machine learning models, random forest (RF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN), along with partial least squares (PLS). The performance ranking of these models is provided as PLS > RF > BPNN. This indicates that PLS, which is a traditional method, is significantly better than the other two models in terms of hyperspectral inversion modeling of the mangrove species' ecological stoichiometries.o"
