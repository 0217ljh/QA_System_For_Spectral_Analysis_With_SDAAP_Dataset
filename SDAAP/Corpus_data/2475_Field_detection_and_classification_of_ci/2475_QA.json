        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy in the non-destructive citrus HLB field detection method for the Shatangju mandarin cultivar was the maximum entropy distance. This metric can reduce the number of bands from 20 to 13, providing the best performance in discriminating the three groups of leaves."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the proposed non-destructive citrus HLB field detection method based on hyperspectral reflectance can be applied to other citrus cultivars besides the Shatangju mandarin. The study specifically focuses on the Shatangju mandarin cultivar and does not mention testing or applicability to other citrus cultivars. Therefore, it is unclear whether the method can be directly applied to other citrus cultivars without further research or experimentation."
