        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of vis-NIR spectroscopy and machine learning improves the accuracy of soil organic matter (SOM) prediction in arid land compared to traditional methods by effectively removing redundant information and optimizing the optimal wavelengths. Traditional methods often rely on manual selection of variables, which can be time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, the use of machine learning algorithms such as the Boruta algorithm allows for automated and objective selection of optimal variables.\n\nBy preselecting spectral wavelengths using Pearson correlation analysis, the past study identified the range of spectral absorption features (i.e., 1400.0, 1900.0, and 2200.0 nm) as the optimal variables for SOM prediction. Additionally, the CARS and Boruta algorithm also selected a few visible wavelengths in the range of 480.0-510.0 nm. These selected wavelengths provide important information about the SOM content.\n\nThe selected wavelengths were then used in combination with machine learning models, specifically partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF), to develop quantitative estimation models for SOM content. Both models showed satisfactory prediction results, with the RF model demonstrating better accuracy than the PLSR model."
