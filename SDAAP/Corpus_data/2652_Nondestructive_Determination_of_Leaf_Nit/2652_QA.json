        "Output": "The metric chosen for the nitrogen content of corn leaves is R-P(2) (R-squared prediction) and RMSEP (Root Mean Square Error of Prediction). The R-P(2) value measures the proportion of the variance in the nitrogen content that can be explained by the fusion models, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect prediction. The RMSEP value represents the average difference between the predicted and actual nitrogen content values, with a lower value indicating a more accurate prediction.]."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fusion of image and spectral features in predicting the nitrogen content of corn leaves has shown improvement compared to traditional methods. The traditional hyperspectral imaging-based techniques typically use a single feature as the input variable, which limits the generalization ability of the prediction model. However, the proposed fusion model combines both image and spectral features, resulting in enhanced prediction performance.\n\nIn the study, corn leaves at the modulation stage were examined, and hyperspectral data in the wavelength range of 400 to 1100 nm were collected. The spectral features were preprocessed using various techniques such as first-order derivatives, standard normal variables transformation (SNV), Savitzky-Golay (S-G) smoothing, and normalization. The CARS-SPA algorithm was employed to screen sensitive spectral variables.\n\nAdditionally, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was utilized to extract texture image features from the test samples. The fusion of corn leaf spectral and texture image features was then modeled as target features.\n\nThe prediction models, namely partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine regression (SVR), were employed to predict the nitrogen content of corn leaves."
