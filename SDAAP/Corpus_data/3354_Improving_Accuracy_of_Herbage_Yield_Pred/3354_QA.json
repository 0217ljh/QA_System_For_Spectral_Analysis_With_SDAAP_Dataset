        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study was the root mean square error (RMSE). The study found that the approach introduced in the study can provide accurate yield estimates with an RMSE of up to 308 kg ha(-1). This means that the predictions of herbage yield using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based structural and spectral features, combined with machine learning algorithms, can have an error of up to 308 kg per hectare."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers combined structural and spectral features in predicting herbage yield in perennial ryegrass varieties and breeding populations using machine learning algorithms by using a modelling framework. They tested three machine learning algorithms: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The structural features, specifically canopy height, and spectral features, specifically vegetation indices, were derived from data gathered with two sensors: a consumer-grade RGB and a 10-band multispectral (MS) camera system. The researchers compared the performance of models fitted with structural data only, spectral data only, and a fusion of both structural and spectral features. The results of the study showed that the fusion of structural and spectral features achieved better dry matter yield (DMY) estimates compared to models fitted with only structural or spectral data, regardless of the sensor or machine learning algorithm used."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fusion of structural and spectral features contributed to achieving better herbage yield estimates in perennial ryegrass varieties and breeding populations compared to models fitted with structural or spectral data only, regardless of the sensor, ploidy level, or machine learning algorithm used. This was revealed by the results of the nested cross-validation. The models that incorporated both structural (canopy height) and spectral (vegetation indices) information provided more accurate predictions of dry matter yield (DMY) compared to models that used only structural or spectral data. The fusion of these features improved the estimation of herbage yield, indicating that combining information from both sources enhanced the predictive power of the models."
