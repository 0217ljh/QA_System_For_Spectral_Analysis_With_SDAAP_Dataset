        "input": "",
        "Output": "The detection results achieved using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and machine learning techniques in the study on the identification and quantification of adulterants in fruit juices were highly accurate. The supervised learning analysis, using support-vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), obtained significant results with an accuracy above 97% on the test set. This indicates that the developed models were able to correctly identify the presence of adulterants in the juices.\n\nRegarding quantification, the results were also very accurate. The best results were obtained using support vector regression and partial least square regression, with an R-2 value greater than 0.99 and a root mean square error (RMSE) less than 1.4 for the test set. This suggests that the developed models were able to accurately quantify the amount of adulterants present in the juices.\n\nOverall, the combination of FT-IR spectroscopy and machine learning techniques proved to be highly effective in detecting and quantifying adulterants in fruit juices, with accuracy levels above 97% for detection and highly accurate quantification results."
