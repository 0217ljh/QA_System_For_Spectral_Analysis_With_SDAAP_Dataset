        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models in this study was the R-c(v)2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSECV (root mean square error of cross-validation). The R-c(v)2 measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (total soluble solids, firmness, or ripening stages) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral data). The RMSECV measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, providing an indication of the accuracy of the models."

        "Output": "In the related research, machine learning algorithms were used to develop predictive models for determining the total soluble solids, firmness, and ripening stages of 'Pacovan' bananas. The researchers used different machine learning algorithms for regression models and supervised classification.\n\nFor the prediction of total soluble solids, the Random Forest algorithm with variable selection was found to be the best model. This algorithm achieved an R-c(v)2 of 0.90 and an RMSECV of 2.31.\n\nFor the prediction of firmness, the Support Vector Machine algorithm with variable selection was identified as the best model. It achieved an R(c)(v)(2) of 0.84 and an RMSECV of 7.98.\n\nFor the classification of different ripening stages, the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm with variable selection was determined to be the best model. It achieved a precision of 74.22%.\n\nOverall, the combination of Vis-NIR spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms proved to be a promising tool for monitoring the quality and ripening stages of 'Pacovan' bananas."
