The high classification accuracy of 96.0% and 97.3% achieved in the related study demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. Traditional methods may not be able to achieve such high accuracy and may be more time-consuming and subjective. Therefore, the use of LIBS and machine learning provides a new and efficient method for charcoal detection and classification."
