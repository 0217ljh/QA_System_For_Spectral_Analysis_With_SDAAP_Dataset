The overall accuracy is used to evaluate the effectiveness of each method and classifier in accurately classifying surface water. The study provides the overall accuracy values for the 20 m ensemble-only method (89.5% \u53641.7%), the ensemble method combined with the random forest classifier (94.3% \u53641.3%) for the 20 m method, and the 10 m method (93.4% \u53641.5%). These values indicate the level of accuracy achieved by each method in accurately mapping surface water without the need for ancillary training data layers."

        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the automated methodology presented in the study can be applied to other spectral bands or resolutions for surface water mapping. The study specifically mentions the use of a single Sentinel-2 granule at 10 m or 20 m resolution with 4 or 9 bands, respectively. It does not discuss the application of the methodology to different spectral bands or resolutions. Therefore, it is unclear whether the methodology can be directly applied to other spectral bands or resolutions without further investigation or modification."
