        "input": "",
        "Output": "Second polynomial order with 20 iterations was used for baseline correction. Acquired spectral data was pre-processed prior to the cluster analysis and label prediction. For statistical and multivariable analysis, spectra were defined and truncated at the fingerprint region (1800\u2013500 cm\u22121). Spectra were normalised by standard normal variate (SNV) before application of the clustering analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and PCA-K means."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Urine spectroscopy using infrared spectroscopy and ATR technology shows promising results for the early detection of endometrial cancer. Past study found that urine spectroscopy was able to distinguish endometrial cancer from benign gynecological conditions with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 97%. These high values suggest that this non-invasive technique could be considered a superior method compared to traditional diagnostic techniques for the early detection of endometrial cancer. However, further studies, particularly low prevalence studies embedded in post-menopausal bleeding clinics, are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the technique's effectiveness in clinical practice."
