The focus of the study is specifically on the classification of plastics and addressing the global plastic challenge. However, it is possible that the techniques and methodologies used in this study could be adapted and applied to other research areas or industries that require classification or analysis of materials using hyperspectral data. Further research and experimentation would be needed to determine the applicability of the model in other contexts."
