        "Output": "The Gaussian processes based approaches improve the accuracy of vegetation parameter retrieval in environments with limited ground truth information in two ways. \n\nFirstly, the adoption of covariance functions based on well-established metrics, such as spectral angle and spectral correlation, helps to enhance the similarity measures for spectral data. These metrics are known to be better measures of similarity as they are resilient to spectral variabilities. By incorporating these covariance functions into the Gaussian processes model, the accuracy of vegetation parameter retrieval is improved.\n\nSecondly, the joint modeling of related vegetation parameters using multitask Gaussian processes is employed. This approach leverages the availability of a larger set of ground truth for related vegetation parameters. By considering the relationships between different vegetation parameters, the prediction accuracy of the vegetation parameter of interest can be enhanced. This joint modeling allows for the transfer of knowledge from related parameters with more ground truth information to the parameter of interest with limited ground truth.\n\nThrough experimental demonstrations on real-world hyperspectral datasets and a synthetic dataset, the efficacy of these Gaussian processes based approaches is shown, highlighting their ability to improve the accuracy of vegetation parameter retrieval in environments with limited ground truth information."

These metrics are known to be better measures of similarity for spectral data, as they are resilient to spectral variabilities. By incorporating these metrics into the covariance functions, the proposed method can better capture the similarities between spectra and improve the accuracy of vegetation parameter retrieval.\n\nThe second approach involves joint modeling of related vegetation parameters using multitask Gaussian processes. This means that the prediction accuracy of the vegetation parameter of interest can be improved by leveraging the larger set of ground truth available for related vegetation parameters. By considering the relationships between different vegetation parameters, the proposed method can enhance the accuracy of parameter retrieval even when ground truth information is limited.\n\nIn experimental evaluations using three real-world hyperspectral datasets and one synthetic dataset, the proposed methods were compared against existing approaches. The results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed methods in improving the accuracy of vegetation parameter retrieval. By incorporating well-established metrics and leveraging related vegetation parameters, the proposed methods outperformed existing approaches in terms of accuracy."
