        "Output": "The researchers used a machine-learning approach based on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to decode individual state anxiety. They analyzed the RSFC among a set of cortical networks and found that the connectivity patterns within these networks were highly predictive of state anxiety. By using machine learning algorithms, they were able to identify specific patterns of connectivity that were associated with different levels of state anxiety."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) can be used as a superior spectroscopic method to predict individual state anxiety in the related study on the role of cortical networks. The related study used RSFC with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and found that the RSFC among a set of cortical networks were highly predictive of state anxiety. The connectivity patterns between different cortical areas within networks such as the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN) were found to be correlated with state anxiety. Therefore, RSFC with fNIRS can be a valuable tool for assessing and predicting individual state anxiety."
