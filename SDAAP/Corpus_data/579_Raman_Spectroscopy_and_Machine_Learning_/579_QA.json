        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, label-free Raman spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for identifying biomolecular changes induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal tumor xenografts. The related study states that the application of label-free Raman spectroscopy demonstrated the ability to elucidate biomolecular changes induced by anti-CFLA4 and anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. The use of multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-AIS) decomposition of Raman spectral datasets allowed for the early detection of changes in lipid, nucleic acid, and collagen content following therapy. Additionally, support vector machine classifiers and random forests analysis provided excellent prediction accuracies for response to both immune checkpoint inhibitors. These findings suggest that label-free Raman spectroscopy can provide sensitive detection of early changes in the biomolecular composition of tumors, making it a superior method compared to traditional methods for identifying these changes."
