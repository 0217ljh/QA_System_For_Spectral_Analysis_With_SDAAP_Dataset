        "Output": "In the related study, the machine learning models were adapted to Raman-based sensing in order to detect novel fentanyl analogs. To achieve this, the researchers extracted features from each Raman spectrum using several techniques. These techniques included smoothing, background subtraction, and principal component analysis (PCA). Smoothing and background subtraction were used to enhance the quality of the spectra, while PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and capture the most important features.\n\nIn addition to these preprocessing techniques, the researchers also extracted features related to spectral peaks and similarity to spectra of known compounds. These features were guided by subject-matter expertise and aimed to capture specific characteristics of fentanyl analogs in the Raman spectra.\n\nTo develop the machine learning models, three different feature sets were used as inputs. The first feature set consisted of the features extracted from PCA, the second feature set consisted of the features related to spectral peaks and similarity to known compounds, and the third feature set combined the features from PCA and spectral peaks.\n\nVarious machine learning techniques were then employed to develop the fentanyl analog classification models. These techniques included multi-layer perceptron, neural network, partial least squares, penalized multinomial regression, random forest, regularized logistic regression, support vector machines, and extreme gradient boosting."
