        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the trained ANNs to predict the different concentration of gas mixtures is the mean absolute error (MAE). The MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted concentrations of gases and the actual concentrations. \n\nIn the first approach, the training of the neural network with a combination of synthetic and measured data improved the MAE of the network predictions from 0.46 to 0.01 ppmV for N2O and from 0.24 to 0.01 ppmV for CO in zero-gas measurements. This significant improvement indicates that the combination of synthetic and measured data can greatly enhance the accuracy of the predictions.\n\nIn the second approach, the retraining of the ANN on a small dataset of measured spectra resulted in a 45% improvement in MAE for ethanol concentration predictions and a 20% improvement in MAE for acetone concentration predictions, compared to training with purely synthetic data. This demonstrates that the addition of a small amount of measured data can further enhance the accuracy of the predictions.\n\nOverall, the use of the MAE metric allows for the evaluation of the performance of the trained ANNs and shows that the combination of synthetic and measured data can significantly improve the predictions of gas concentrations."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, two approaches were used to train the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and improve the accuracy of concentration predictions for different gas mixtures in quantitative infrared gas spectroscopy.\n\nThe first approach involved training a neural network hybridly using a combination of synthetically generated infrared absorption spectra and measured zero-gas spectra. The synthetically generated spectra were of mixtures of N2O and CO, while the measured zero-gas spectra were obtained using a mid-infrared dual comb spectrometer. This approach significantly improved the mean absolute error (MAE) of the network predictions for N2O and CO concentrations. The MAE for zero-gas measurements decreased from 0.46 to 0.01 ppmV for N2O and from 0.24 to 0.01 ppmV for CO. Additionally, this approach achieved a similar performance on spectra from gas mixtures of 0-100 ppmV N2O and 0 to 60 ppmV CO.\n\nThe second approach involved retraining an ANN that was pre-trained on synthetic infrared spectra of mixtures of acetone and ethanol. The retraining was done using a small dataset consisting of 26 spectra taken with a mid-infrared photoacoustic spectrometer."

        "Output": "The combination of synthetically generated and measured data in training artificial neural networks (ANNs) improves the accuracy of concentration predictions for different gas mixtures in quantitative infrared gas spectroscopy by reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) of the network predictions.\n\nIn the first approach, the neural network is trained with a combination of synthetically generated infrared absorption spectra of mixtures of N2O and CO, as well as measured zero-gas spectra. This hybrid training approach improves the MAE of the network predictions from 0.46 to 0.01 ppmV for N2O and from 0.24 to 0.01 ppmV for CO in zero-gas measurements. Additionally, this approach achieves a similar performance on spectra from gas mixtures of 0-100 ppmV N2O and 0 to 60 ppmV CO.\n\nIn the second approach, an ANN pre-trained on synthetic infrared spectra of mixtures of acetone and ethanol is retrained on a small dataset consisting of 26 spectra taken with a mid-infrared photoacoustic spectrometer.
