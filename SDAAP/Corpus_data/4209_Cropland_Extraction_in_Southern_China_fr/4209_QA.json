        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers incorporated residual learning and the channel attention mechanism in the improved HRRS-U-Net model for cropland extraction in southern China using VHR remote sensing images by introducing these techniques to extract deeper discriminative representations. \n\nResidual learning, also known as skip connections, was used to enable the model to learn residual mappings, which helps in capturing fine details and improving the accuracy of cropland extraction. This technique allows the model to learn the difference between the input and output features, making it easier to learn complex mappings.\n\nThe channel attention mechanism was also introduced to the model. This mechanism helps the model to focus on important features by assigning different weights to different channels. By emphasizing informative channels and suppressing less relevant ones, the model can better capture the distinctive characteristics of cropland, leading to more accurate identification of cropland extent and field boundaries.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, the improved HRRS-U-Net model was able to maintain high-resolution details throughout the network and generate precise cropland boundaries, addressing the challenges of heterogeneity and fragmentation of cropland in southern China."

The method achieved an overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 97.00% to 98.33% and F1 scores (F1) of 0.830-0.940, with Kappa coefficients (Kappa) of 0.814-0.929. The overall accuracy for all study areas was 97.85%, with an F1 score of 0.915 and Kappa coefficient of 0.901. \n\nFurthermore, the proposed method demonstrated advantages over machine learning methods like Random Forest (RF) and previous semantic segmentation models such as U-Net, U-Net++, U-Net3+, and MPSPNet. This indicates that the proposed deep learning-based method is more accurate and reliable for cropland extraction in southern China using VHR remote images compared to traditional methods."
