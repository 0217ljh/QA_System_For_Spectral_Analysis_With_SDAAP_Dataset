        "Output": "The proposed attention-based vision transformer neural network outperforms or is on par with existing methods in terms of detection and concentration prediction accuracy for nitroaromatic explosives using raw SERS maps without any preprocessing. This conclusion is based on experimental results obtained from two novel SERS datasets, 2,4-dinitrophenols (DNP) and picric acid (PA), as well as one benchmark SERS dataset, 4-nitrobenzenethiol (4-NBT), which includes repeated measurements down to concentrations as low as 1 nM. The approach not only achieves high sensitivity but also provides attention maps that can identify regions with a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the SERS maps, offering additional insights for analysis. Overall, the use of raw SERS maps with the attention-based vision transformer neural network shows promise as a viable alternative to existing approaches for detecting and quantifying nitroaromatic explosives."

        "Output": "The proposed attention-based vision transformer neural network using raw SERS maps without preprocessing outperforms or is on par with traditional methods in terms of detection and concentration prediction accuracy for nitroaromatic explosives. The authors experimentally demonstrate that their approach is more effective than existing methods. Additionally, the produced attention maps allow for the identification of regions with a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the SERS maps, providing further insights into the detection process. Based on these findings, using raw SERS maps for molecule of interest detection and concentration prediction shows promise as an alternative to current approaches."
