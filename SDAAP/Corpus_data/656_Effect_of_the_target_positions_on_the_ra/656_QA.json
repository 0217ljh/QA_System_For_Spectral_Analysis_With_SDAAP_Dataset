        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the identification accuracy of different positions of the focusing lens and target surface by using principal component analysis (PCA) combined with support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). They selected the intensity and intensity ratio of fifteen lines of six elements in the FIBS spectrum as the source data set. The distances between the focusing lens and the target surface in the pre-filament, filament, and post-filament were specified. The first three principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) obtained from PCA were used as input variables for SVM and KNN. The identification accuracy of the different positions was then obtained, with the SVM achieving 100% accuracy in the filament position and the KNN achieving 90% accuracy."
