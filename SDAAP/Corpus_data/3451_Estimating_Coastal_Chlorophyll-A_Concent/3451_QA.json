        "Output": "Yes, the addition of spectral indices using the LightGBM model can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for estimating chl-a concentration in coastal waters. The study found that the LightGBM model, when supplemented with spectral indices based on OLCI feature bands, significantly improved the prediction accuracy of chl-a concentration. The performance indicators, such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R-2, demonstrated that the LightGBM model with spectral indices outperformed traditional methods. Additionally, the study compared the LightGBM model with other OLCI chl-a products and found that it also outperformed them. Therefore, the LightGBM model with spectral indices can be considered a superior method for estimating chl-a concentration in coastal waters."
