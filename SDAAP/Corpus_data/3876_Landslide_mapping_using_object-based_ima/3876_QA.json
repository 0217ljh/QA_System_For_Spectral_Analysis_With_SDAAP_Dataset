        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the open source Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system utilizing object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine learning can be considered superior to traditional manual techniques for mapping landslides over large areas. The system was tested in a 575 km(2) area along the Pasang Lhamu Highway in Nepal, where a large number of landslides were triggered by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. The comparison with a manual inventory showed that the system was able to detect 70% of the landslide area. Additionally, the speed and efficiency of the system in detecting landslides make it a viable alternative to manual techniques when establishing approximate landslide locations is of prime importance."
