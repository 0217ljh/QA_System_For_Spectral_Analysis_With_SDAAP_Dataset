The study reported that the 1D convolutional neural network (CNN-1D) achieved a validation accuracy of 0.94 for both spinach and potato residues. In comparison, the support vector machine classifier had a validation accuracy of 0.9 for spinach and 0.92 for potato residues. Therefore, the chosen metric, validation accuracy, was able to measure the performance of the classification methods and showed that the CNN-1D technique had improved classification accuracy compared to the support vector machine classifier."

The CNN-1D technique exhibited the highest classification accuracy, with a calibration result of 0.99 and 0.98, and a validation result of 0.94 for both spinach and potato residues. In comparison, the traditional support vector machine classifier had a validation accuracy of 0.9 and 0.92 for spinach and potato residues, respectively. Therefore, the VNIR hyperspectral imaging technique with deep learning has the potential to provide improved performance in detecting and classifying organic residues in food facilities."
