This deep learning algorithm was able to analyze the molecular vibrational and rotational energy levels of the cells, providing fingerprint information about their characteristics.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the residual network was able to quickly and accurately identify various tumor cells and blood cells with an accuracy of 100%. This means that the algorithm was able to correctly classify all the cells without any errors.\n\nOne of the advantages of using the residual network is that it does not require complex preprocessing of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra. This means that the algorithm can directly analyze the spectra without the need for additional steps or calculations.\n\nOverall, the residual network contributed to the rapid and accurate identification of blood cells and tumor cells by effectively analyzing the molecular characteristics of the cells and providing accurate classification results."
