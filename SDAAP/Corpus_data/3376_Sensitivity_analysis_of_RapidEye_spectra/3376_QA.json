        "Output": "Yes, the statistical relationship between defoliation in pine forests and the spectral bands of the RapidEye sensor can be effectively investigated using the NDRE and NDVI indices, as demonstrated in the related study. The study found that both the NDRE and NDVI responded similarly to changes in the amount of foliage, but exhibited particular strengths at different levels of defoliation. The NDRE yielded higher classification accuracy in classes with none to moderate defoliation, while the NDVI yielded higher accuracy in classes with severe or complete defoliation. Combining both indices in a discriminant function or a machine-learning-based decision tree classifier improved overall accuracy compared to using either index alone."
