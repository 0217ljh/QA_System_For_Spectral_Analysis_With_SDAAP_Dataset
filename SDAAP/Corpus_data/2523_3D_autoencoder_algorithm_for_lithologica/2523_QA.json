The 3D convolutional autoencoder is designed to extract spatial-spectral features, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the geological features present in the data.\n\n2. Efficient and accurate results: The combination of deep learning and hyperspectral data in the 3D convolutional autoencoder can provide more efficient and highly accurate results compared to traditional methods. This is due to the ability of deep learning models to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n\n3. Robustness under small sample conditions: The proposed method shows better robustness than supervised learning methods, making it suitable for geological mapping applications with limited training data. This is particularly important in scenarios where obtaining a large amount of labeled data is challenging.\n\n4. Unsupervised spatial-spectral feature learning: The 3D convolutional autoencoder utilizes unsupervised spatial-spectral feature learning technology, which is a novel approach in geological mapping applications. This allows for the extraction of meaningful features from the hyperspectral data without the need for manual labeling or annotation."
