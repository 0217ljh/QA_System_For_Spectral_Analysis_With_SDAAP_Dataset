        "Output": "Machine learning methods were utilized in the newly designed multispectral imaging technique for diagnosing OSSN by deploying inter and intra-patient frameworks to automatically detect and delineate OSSN. Different machine learning methods were evaluated, with K nearest neighbor chosen as the preferred classifier for the intra-patient framework and Support Vector Machine chosen for the inter-patient framework. These machine learning methods were used to analyze the multispectral images and produce maps of the neoplastic-non neoplastic interface, allowing for the detection and identification of OSSN."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The newly designed multispectral imaging technique shows promise in diagnosing Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN) compared to traditional methods. The technique involves using a custom-built spectral imaging system with 38 spectral channels to obtain auto fluorescence multispectral microscopy images of biopsy specimens. Machine learning methods, specifically K nearest neighbor and Support Vector Machine classifiers, are used to automatically detect and delineate OSSN within and between patients. \n\nThe quantitative analysis of the spectral images provides a strong multispectral signature that distinguishes neoplastic tissue from normal tissue both within each patient and between patients. The technique was able to detect OSSN in all patients investigated. The cancer margins detected by multispectral analysis were in close agreement with the margins observed in the H&E sections, indicating the accuracy of the technique.\n\nOverall, the newly designed multispectral imaging technique, combined with machine learning methods, offers a fully automated and rapid diagnostic tool for OSSN. It provides maps of the neoplastic-non neoplastic interface, which can be used for intraoperative assessment. This suggests that the technique has the potential to be translated into future clinical applications for diagnosing OSSN."
