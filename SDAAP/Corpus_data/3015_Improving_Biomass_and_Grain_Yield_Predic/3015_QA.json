        "Output": "The related study evaluated the ability of different remote sensing techniques, including multispectral, hyperspectral, and 3D point cloud, along with machine learning models, to improve the estimation of biomass and grain yield of wheat genotypes on sodic soils. At close to flowering, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground-based proximal sensing were used to collect remote and/or proximal sensing data. Biomass yield and crop heights were manually measured in the field, while grain yield was machine-harvested at maturity. The remote sensing data, such as spectral vegetation indices (VIs) derived from UAV multispectral data, were closely correlated with wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields. The RGB 3D point cloud technique was effective in determining crop height, which was slightly better correlated with genotypic biomass and grain yield than ground-measured crop height data. These remote sensing-derived crop traits (VIs and crop height) and wheat biomass and grain yields were further simulated using machine learning algorithms, including multitarget linear regression, support vector machine regression, Gaussian process regression, and artificial neural network, with different kernels to improve estimation accuracy. The artificial neural network model showed slightly less error in predicting biomass and grain yield compared to the other models."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of multispectral, hyperspectral, and 3D point cloud remote sensing techniques, along with machine learning algorithms, can enhance the estimation of biomass and grain yield of wheat genotypes on sodic soils compared to traditional methods. The study evaluated the ability of these techniques to improve estimation of biomass and grain yield of wheat genotypes grown on sodic soil sites in Australia. The results showed that remote sensing-derived spectral vegetation indices (VIs) and crop height obtained through unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground-based proximal sensing were closely correlated with wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields. The RGB 3D point cloud technique was also effective in determining crop height, which was slightly better correlated with genotypic biomass and grain yield than ground-measured crop height data. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms, such as multitarget linear regression, support vector machine regression, Gaussian process regression, and artificial neural network, were used to simulate and improve the estimation of biomass and grain yield. The artificial neural network, in particular, showed slightly less error in predicting biomass and grain yield compared to the other algorithms. Therefore, the combination of these remote sensing techniques and machine learning algorithms can enhance the accuracy of estimating biomass and grain yield of wheat genotypes"
