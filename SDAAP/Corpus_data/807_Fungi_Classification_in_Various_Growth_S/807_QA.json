        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of DET_FST processing spectra and SVM model can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for classifying different types of dark septate endophytes (DSEs) fungi and detecting their growth stages in a non-destructive and time-saving manner, as demonstrated in the related study on using SWIR spectroscopy. The related study showed that this combination yielded the best classification accuracy for fungi classification at different growth stages and growth stage detection on different fungus types. The mean accuracy of the generic model for fungi classification and growth stage detection were 0.92 and 0.99 on the calibration set, respectively. This method provides a rapid and efficient tool for studying fungi and can be used for classification and growth stage detection in a non-destructive and time-saving manner."
