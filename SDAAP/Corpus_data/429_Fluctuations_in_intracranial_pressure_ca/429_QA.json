        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) shows promise as a non-invasive method for accurately estimating changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) over time. The study demonstrated that hemoglobin concentrations measured using NIRS were highly correlated with induced ICP oscillations. The researchers were able to translate the NIRS data into non-invasive ICP measurements that matched both in magnitude and time alignment with invasively measured references. Therefore, NIRS can be considered a potentially superior method compared to traditional invasive methods for estimating changes in ICP."
