        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy of the proposed method is the overall classification accuracy. This metric measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels in relation to the total number of pixels in the tested area. The overall classification accuracy can provide a general assessment of the performance of the proposed method in distinguishing different land cover classes."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed object-based classification method using Sentinel-2 satellite data has been found to have higher accuracy compared to traditional methods when area-specific training samples and NDVI summary indices are not available. The overall classification accuracy of the proposed method ranged from 78-90% at the first hierarchical level and 76-89% at the second level in the tested areas. In comparison, the random forest (RF) machine learning method, which is a traditional method, had an accuracy that was 5-35 percentage points lower than the proposed method when area-specific training samples were not used. Additionally, without the NDVI summary indices, the accuracy of the RF classifier decreased by another 10-30 percentage points. Therefore, the proposed method outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, especially in the absence of area-specific training samples and NDVI summary indices."
