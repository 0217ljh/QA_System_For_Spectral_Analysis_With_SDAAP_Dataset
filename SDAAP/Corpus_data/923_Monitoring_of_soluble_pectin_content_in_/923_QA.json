        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of MIR spectroscopy, TD-NMR, and machine learning classification models can be considered a superior and non-destructive method for monitoring changes in soluble pectin content (SPC) in orange juice compared to traditional laborious and time-consuming methods. The related study demonstrates that this approach allows for the rapid assessment of SPC trends in orange juice with high accuracy (85% and 89%). In contrast, current reference methods for SPC in orange juice are described as laborious and requiring several extractions with successive adjustments, which hinder rapid process intervention. Therefore, the combination of MIR spectroscopy, TD-NMR, and machine learning classification models offers a more efficient and non-destructive alternative for monitoring SPC changes in orange juice."
