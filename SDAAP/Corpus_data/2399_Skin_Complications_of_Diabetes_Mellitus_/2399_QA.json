        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized in the diagnostic approach by incorporating them into the photonics-based technology and physiological characteristics. These models were trained using data from feasibility studies and actual tests on patients with diabetes and healthy volunteers. The machine learning models were designed to analyze the hyperspectral imaging data obtained through the polarization-based imaging technique. By learning patterns and correlations within the data, the models were able to differentiate between the diabetic and control groups, thereby identifying and evaluating the skin complications of diabetes mellitus at an early stage. This integration of machine learning with photonics-based technology and physiological characteristics provided a novel and effective approach for diagnosing and studying age-related diseases, particularly in relation to collagen dysfunction caused by protein glycation."
