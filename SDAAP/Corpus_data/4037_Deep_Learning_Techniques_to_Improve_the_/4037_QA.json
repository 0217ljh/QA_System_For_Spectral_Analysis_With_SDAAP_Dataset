        "input": "",
        "Output": "The specific olive oil markers were selected from the whole spectral fingerprint obtained with the GC-IMS method based on their relevance and discriminatory power in differentiating between the three classes of olive oil samples (extra virgin olive oil, virgin olive oil, and lampante olive oil). These markers were identified through a chemometric data treatment, which involved analyzing the data obtained from the GC-IMS method and identifying the compounds or characteristics that were most indicative of each olive oil class. The selected markers were then used as input variables in the Deep Learning model for the classification of the olive oil samples."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the deep learning approach applied to data obtained from chemical instrumental techniques can be used to classify olive oil samples into their corresponding categories in this research. The related study states that the aim of the research is to combine chemical techniques and deep learning approaches to automatically classify olive oil samples into three categories: extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), virgin olive oil (VOO), and lampante olive oil (LOO). The deep learning model is built using 701 samples obtained from two olive oil campaigns, and the data from the two harvests are selected based on specific olive oil markers obtained through GC-IMS method. The results obtained in the research show that the deep learning approach applied to the data from chemical instrumental techniques achieves higher success rates in classifying the oil samples compared to previous works."
