        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study is the protein-bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) fluorescence. This metric was used to monitor metabolic changes and transformation in brain tumors. The study found that the protein-bound FMN fluorescence increased in brain tumors, indicating a shift towards a more glycolytic metabolism. This metric was able to differentiate between different tumor entities, such as low-grade gliomas, high-grade gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases. The results suggest that this metric has the potential to support the neurosurgeon in visualizing and classifying brain tumor tissue during surgery."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study suggests that the use of optical imaging of autofluorescence in brain tumor surgery can improve tumor visualization and patient prognosis compared to traditional methods by maximizing the extent of tumor resection. This is achieved by monitoring metabolic changes and transformations in brain tumors through the fluorescence emitted by coenzymes such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The study also highlights the importance of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in tumor imaging, which has been previously underestimated. By analyzing fluorescence lifetime and spectra data, the study found that protein-bound FMN fluorescence increased in brain tumors, indicating a shift towards a more glycolytic metabolism. These metrics were found to be characteristic for different tumor entities and showed promise for machine learning-based brain tumor classification. Overall, the study suggests that optical imaging of autofluorescence can provide valuable information to support neurosurgeons in visualizing and classifying brain tumor tissue during surgery, ultimately improving patient prognosis."
