        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the dough fermentation monitoring models was accuracy. The accuracy of the training set and prediction set for both the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) model and the support vector machine (SVM) model were provided. The accuracy of the KNN model was 89% for the training set and 86% for the prediction set. The accuracy of the SVM model was 94% for the training set and 92% for the prediction set. Therefore, the accuracy metric indicates the percentage of correctly predicted fermentation states by the models."

The training set accuracy of the SVM model is 94%, while the prediction set accuracy is 92%. In contrast, the KNN model has a training set accuracy of 89% and a prediction set accuracy of 86%. Therefore, the SVM model outperforms the KNN model in terms of accuracy for monitoring dough fermentation."
