        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the estimation accuracy of the hyperspectral soil nutrient estimation method based on the BA-AdaBoost model is the coefficient of determination. The coefficient of determination measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (soil nutrient content) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral reflectance, first derivative of reflectance, reciprocal logarithm of reflectance, etc.). \n\nThe coefficient of determination can range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect fit of the model to the data, and a value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance in the data. \n\nIn the related study, the coefficient of determination for soil organic matter estimation was found to be 0.867, indicating that the BA-AdaBoost model can explain 86.7% of the variance in soil organic matter content based on the hyperspectral data. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of coefficient of determination provides a measure of how well the BA-AdaBoost model can estimate soil nutrient content, and in this case, it shows that the model has a high level of accuracy in estimating soil organic matter content."

The BA is used to search for the globally optimal values of these parameters. The objective function value is used as the basis for optimization, and the BA-AdaBoost combined model is constructed to estimate soil organic matter and phosphorus and potassium contents. The results show that the BA-AdaBoost combined model can better search for globally optimal parameters, significantly improving the accuracy and reliability of the AdaBoost model."

The results of the study show that the BA-AdaBoost combined model can better search for globally optimal parameters, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in estimating soil organic matter and phosphorus and potassium contents. \n\nSpecifically, the accuracy and reliability of the model were significantly improved compared to the model before optimization. The coefficient of determination for soil organic matter estimation was found to be 0.867, indicating a high level of accuracy. The root mean square error was 0.151g . kg(-1), suggesting a low level of error in the estimation. \n\nFurthermore, the model accuracy and reliability improved by 29.0% and 24.1%, respectively, compared to the traditional model.
