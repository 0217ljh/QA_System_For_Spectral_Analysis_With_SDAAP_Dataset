        "Output": "Yes, the full-band models of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be considered superior to characteristic variable models in discriminating mutton freshness grades based on their accuracies. The related study states that the full-band models of both HSI and NIRS showed good performance, with accuracies of all datasets higher than 92.6%. On the other hand, the model accuracy decreased gradually with the decrease of the variables number when modeling with characteristic variables. Therefore, the full-band models of HSI and NIRS outperformed the characteristic variable models in terms of accuracy in discriminating mutton freshness grades."
