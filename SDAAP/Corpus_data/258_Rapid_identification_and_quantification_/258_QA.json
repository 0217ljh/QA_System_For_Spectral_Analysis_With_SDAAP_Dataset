        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for the identification and quantification of Panax notoginseng (PN) and its adulterants. The traditional methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) are time-consuming, laborious, and difficult to realize rapid and online analysis. In contrast, NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics offers a faster and more efficient approach for identification and quantification. The past study used five chemical pattern recognition methods and achieved 100% classification accuracy for the identification of PN and its three adulterants. Additionally, the past study compared five multivariate calibration methods and found that partial least squares regression (PLSR) was the optimal method for quantitative analysis. The predictive ability of the PLSR model for PN contents was further improved by applying various preprocessing methods to the spectra. Overall, the results suggest that NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics is a superior method for the identification and quantification of PN and its adulterants."
