        "Output": "The ML and DL models performed well in predicting specialty coffee flavors using near-infrared spectra of ground coffee as input. Both the ML method (support vector machine) and the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) achieved similar performance, with a recall of 70-73% and an accuracy of 75-77%. This indicates that these models have the potential to accurately predict the flavors of specialty coffee.\n\nThe implications of this study are significant for the feasibility of using spectroscopic methods in predicting complex flavors in food and beverage products. Currently, flavor descriptions of specialty coffee beans are provided by certified coffee cuppers, who are rare and in high demand. By training ML and DL models to predict flavors based on near-infrared spectra, this study offers a new and objective framework for flavor prediction.\n\nThe successful development of these models suggests that spectroscopic methods can be utilized to predict complex flavors in other food and beverage products as well. This has the potential to revolutionize the industry by providing a more efficient and accessible method for flavor analysis. Additionally, the proposed visualization method, the focusing plot, allows for a better understanding of the correlation between the spectral region, predicted flavor categories, and chemical composition, further enhancing the explainability of the models.\n\nOverall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and"
