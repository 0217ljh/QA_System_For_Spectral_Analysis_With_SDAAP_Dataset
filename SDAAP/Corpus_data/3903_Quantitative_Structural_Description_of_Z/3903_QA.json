        "Output": "Yes, the application of machine learning algorithms to spectroscopic data for establishing structure-spectrum correlations in zeolites can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and prediction quality. In the study mentioned, ML algorithms were applied to theoretically simulated infrared (IR) spectra of 230 different types of zeolite frameworks. The classification problem of predicting the presence or absence of possible tilings and secondary building units (SBUs) achieved an accuracy above 89%. Additionally, the regression problem of predicting continuous descriptors such as Si-O distances, Si-O-Si angles, and volume of TO4 tetrahedra achieved a prediction quality above or close to 90%. These results demonstrate the potential of ML algorithms to accurately predict and establish correlations between structural information and spectral features in zeolites, surpassing traditional methods."
