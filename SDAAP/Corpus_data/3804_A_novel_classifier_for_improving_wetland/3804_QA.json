        "Output": "The metric chosen to validate the identified wetland maps in the related study was the Kappa coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE). The Kappa coefficient is a statistical measure that assesses the agreement between the observed and predicted classifications, taking into account the agreement that could occur by chance. It provides a measure of accuracy by comparing the observed agreement with the expected agreement. The RMSE, on the other hand, measures the average difference between the predicted and observed values.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the study does not provide a specific threshold or range for the Kappa coefficient or RMSE. The proposed fused ANN-based hybrid model outperformed all other models in terms of accuracy, achieving a Kappa coefficient of 89.4% and an RMSE of 0.13. These values indicate a high level of accuracy in the wetland mapping process."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the novel approach to automated complex wetland mapping in Bangladesh's Sunamganj District, four machine learning classifiers were utilized. These classifiers were random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision tree (DT). These classifiers were used to classify the complex wetland image. Additionally, an artificial neural network (ANN) was applied to previously identified models and spectral bands of satellite images to create a hybrid classifier. The accuracy of all four machine learning classifiers was found to be higher on the fused images than on the multispectral (MS) image. The proposed fused ANN-based hybrid model outperformed all fused and MS classification models in terms of accuracy."
