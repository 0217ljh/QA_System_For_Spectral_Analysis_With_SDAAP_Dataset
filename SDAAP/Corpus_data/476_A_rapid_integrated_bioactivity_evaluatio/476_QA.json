        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The past study suggests that the integrated NIRS and bioactive strategy can be used for fast quality management in Flos Chrysanthemi and other botanical food quality control. The study collected near infrared reflection spectra (NIRS) of Flos Chrysanthemi samples and used corresponding anti-inflammation activities to evaluate the spectrum-activity relationship. The study also developed calibration models and used machine learning approaches to analyze the relationship between quality markers and anti-inflammation activity. The results indicated that the integrated NIRS and bioactive strategy was suitable for fast quality management in Flos Chrysanthemi and could be applied to other botanical food quality control."
