        "Output": "The researchers applied machine learning (ML) methods to classify and predict the miscibility of polymer blends for scaffold engineering and cell-material interactions by using six supervised classification algorithms. These algorithms were trained on physicochemical parameters obtained through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis, and mechanical properties of the polymer blends. The input data from these assessments were used to train the ML algorithms. The researchers found that the random forest classifier performed the best among the six algorithms, providing optimal performance metrics. This approach allowed them to accurately classify and predict the miscibility of the polymer blends, which is crucial for designing effective scaffolds for wound healing."
