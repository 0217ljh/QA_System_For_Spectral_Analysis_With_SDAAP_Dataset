        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to identify major crops in the Chiayi Golden Corridor was the confusion matrix. The metric can go as far as achieving a 97.1% accuracy in classifying the major crops, with only two misjudgments in the potato fields."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The purpose of developing a multi-category crop hyperspectral image classification system in the Chiayi Golden Corridor was to identify the major crops in the area. This system aimed to analyze and classify different crops using remote sensing data from CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager). The study used a two-stage classification approach, combining support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques, to improve the accuracy of crop identification and classification. The system also included a repair module to address any classification errors."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it can be inferred that the combination of SVM and CNN was used specifically in the study to develop a multi-category crop hyperspectral image classification system for the Chiayi Golden Corridor. The study aimed to identify major crops in the area using this combination."
