Several semantic segmentation network architectures, including U-Net, HRNet, Fast-SCNN, and DeepLabv3+, were applied to Sentinel-2 imagery and Landsat-8 imagery in three wildfire sites in two different local climate zones. The validation results show that the DL algorithms outperform the ML methods in two of the three cases with compact burned scars. However, ML methods seem to be more suitable for mapping dispersed burn in boreal forests."
