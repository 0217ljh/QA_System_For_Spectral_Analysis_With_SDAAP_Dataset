        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictability of the optimized algorithms is the Average Absolute Percentage Error (AAPE). This metric measures the average percentage difference between the predicted TOC values and the actual TOC values. \n\nThe AAPE values for the optimized ANFIS, SVR, and RF algorithms were found to be 10.6%, 12.0%, and 8.9% respectively, for the validation data of Well-3. This indicates that the optimized algorithms have a relatively low average percentage error in predicting the TOC. "

        "Output": "In the related study, four machine learning algorithms (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), functional neural networks (FNN), and random forests (RFs)) were optimized to evaluate the total organic carbon (TOC) in unconventional reservoirs using bulk gamma-ray (GR) and spectral GR logs of uranium, thorium, and potassium.\n\nThe optimization process involved training the machine learning algorithms on 749 datasets from Well-1. These datasets were used to teach the algorithms how to predict the TOC based on the input variables (bulk GR and spectral GR logs). \n\nAfter training, the optimized algorithms were tested on 226 datasets from Well-2 to assess their performance and accuracy in predicting the TOC. Additionally, the algorithms were validated on 73 data points from Well-3 to further evaluate their predictive capabilities.\n\nThe performance of the optimized algorithms was compared with the available empirical equations commonly used to estimate TOC. The results showed that the optimized ANFIS, SVR, and RF models outperformed the empirical equations in predicting TOC."

In comparison, the FNN model had an AAPE of 21.1%. \n\nWhen the available empirical equations were used, the TOC was assessed with higher AAPEs. For the same validation data from Well-3, the Schmoker model had an AAPE of 48.6%, the Delta logR method had an AAPE of 24.6%, the Zhao et al. correlation had an AAPE of 20.2%, and the Mahmoud et al. correlation had an AAPE of 17.8%.\n\nTherefore, the optimized ANFIS, SVR, and RF models showed better predictability and accuracy in estimating TOC compared to the available empirical equations when using the bulk GR and spectral GR"
