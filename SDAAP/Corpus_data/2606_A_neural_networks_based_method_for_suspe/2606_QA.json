        "Output": "Yes, the neural network calibrator (NNC) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional empirical algorithms for improving the accuracy of remote sensing retrieval of suspended sediment concentration (SSC). The study systematically investigated four empirical baseline models and evaluated the improvement of accuracy after the calibration of NNC. The results showed that the calibrated D'Sa model, which used the NNC, had the highest accuracy. The implementation of NNC resulted in a decrease in root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and an increase in the coefficient of determination (R-2). Additionally, the study demonstrated that the NNC can be used for both baseline model calibration and temporal calibration, further enhancing the accuracy of SSC retrieval. Therefore, the NNC method provides a universal double calibration approach that minimizes the inherent errors of baseline models and achieves a moderate improvement in accuracy."
