        "Output": "The performance results of the machine learning algorithms using all available predictors (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Deep Neural Network) in estimating chl-a concentration in the Menor sea using Sentinel-2 data were better compared to those using principal components. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms using all predictors was 0.82 mg/m3, while the RMSE for Deep Neural Network was 1.76 mg/m3. On the other hand, the Artificial Neural Network algorithm achieved better results when using principal components."
