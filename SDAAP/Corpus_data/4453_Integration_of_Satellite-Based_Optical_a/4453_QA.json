        "input": "",
        "Output": "The chosen metric in the related study was the integration of the normalized difference red-edge vegetation index (NDVI_RE1) from Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric (InSAR) coherence. This metric was used to estimate the biomass of winter cover crops. \n\nThe study found that the metric was able to estimate biomass up to a certain point of saturation, which occurred at approximately 1900 kg ha(-1). Beyond this point, the accuracy of biomass estimations decreased. Therefore, the metric was limited in its ability to accurately estimate biomass beyond the saturation point."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the integration of the normalized difference red-edge vegetation index (NDVI_RE1) from Sentinel-2 and SAR interferometric coherence can be considered a superior spectral feature processing method for estimating the biomass of winter cover crops in Maryland. The study assessed the integration of optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) imagery to estimate winter cover crop biomass across 27 fields over three winter-spring seasons in Maryland. The results showed that the combination of NDVI_RE1 and SAR interferometric coherence provided the best estimation of biomass for cereal grass cover crops."
