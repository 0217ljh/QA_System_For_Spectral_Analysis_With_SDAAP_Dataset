The related study found that resampled leaf-level ASD spectral data matching the spectral resolution of the UAS-based data at five spectral bands ranging from 360 to 900 nm provided sufficient spectral information to estimate plot-level sorghum and corn N concentration. Therefore, the chosen metric of VIs based on spectral data can accurately estimate N concentration in sorghum and corn crops."

        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) were used to estimate sorghum and corn N concentration based on the spectral data collected from the UAS and ASD spectroradiometer. The researchers used a suite of vegetation indices (VIs) along with the MLAs to develop models for estimating N concentration. These MLAs were trained using the spectral data and corresponding foliar N concentration measurements obtained from foliage samples collected in the field. The trained MLAs were then used to predict N concentration in the experimental plots based on the spectral data collected by the UAS and ASD. By utilizing MLAs, the researchers were able to analyze and interpret the complex relationships between the spectral information and N concentration, enabling them to estimate N concentration accurately."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The related study assessed the capability of unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) and non-imaging spectroscopic data in estimating sorghum and corn nitrogen (N) concentration by collecting canopy- and leaf-level spectral data from sorghum and corn using a UAS and an ASD spectroradiometer. Foliage samples were also collected in the field and foliar N concentration was measured in the lab for model validation.\n\nTo determine the impact of spectral resolution on estimating N concentration, the leaf-level ASD data was resampled to generate datasets with coarser spectral resolutions. The impact of spatial resolution on estimating N concentration was determined by resampling the UAS data to simulate five datasets with varying spatial resolutions ranging from 5 cm to 1 m.\n\nThe findings regarding the impact of spectral resolution showed that the resampled leaf-level ASD data, matching the spectral resolution of the UAS-based data at five spectral bands ranging from 360 to 900 nm, provided sufficient spectral information to estimate plot-level sorghum and corn N concentration.\n\nRegarding spatial resolution, the canopy-level UAS data resampled at multiple pixel sizes, ranging from 1 cm to 1 m, consistently showed the capability of estimating N concentration.\n\nOverall, the findings of the study indicate the possibility of developing monitoring instruments"
