        "Output": "The researchers used machine learning in conjunction with elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS) to improve the reliability of pulmonary lesion targeting during biopsy procedures by analyzing the optical spectra recorded with an ESS fiberoptic probe in different areas of the resected pulmonary tissues. They retrospectively analyzed 2032 measurements from excised tissues of 35 patients using an artificial intelligence model. This allowed them to distinguish alveolar tissue from bronchi, alveolar tissue from lesions, and bronchi from lesions with high accuracy. By integrating ESS fiberoptic probes with surgical intervention tools, the researchers aim to verify that the sampling tool is properly located within the target lesion, thus improving the diagnostic yield and reliability of pulmonary lesion targeting during biopsy procedures."

        "instruction": "Can elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS), coupled with machine learning, be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for distinguishing lung lesions from nearby tissue types in real time during biopsy procedures?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS), coupled with machine learning, shows promise as a method for distinguishing lung lesions from nearby tissue types in real time during biopsy procedures. The study conducted with freshly-excised lung tissues from surgical resections demonstrated that ESS, integrated with a fiberoptic probe, was able to accurately distinguish alveolar tissue from bronchi, alveolar tissue from lesions, and bronchi from lesions. This suggests that ESS has the potential to improve the reliability of pulmonary lesion targeting when integrated with surgical intervention tools."
