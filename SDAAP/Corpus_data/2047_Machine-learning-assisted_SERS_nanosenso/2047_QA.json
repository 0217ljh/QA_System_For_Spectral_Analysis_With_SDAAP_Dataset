        "Output": "The text states that the SERS nanosensor array used in the novel fingerprinting platform for multiplex detection of flavor molecules in Baijiu achieved an accuracy of 100% for fingerprinting ten typical flavors in Baijiu. This indicates that the accuracy of the SERS nanosensor array is very high. \n\nIn terms of sensitivity, the text mentions that the SERS nanosensor array had linear detection ranges over two orders of magnitude and limits of detection ranging from 3.45 x 10(-3) mg/L to 1.21 x 10(-2) mg/L for different flavor molecules. This suggests that the SERS nanosensor array is highly sensitive in detecting and quantifying the flavor molecules in Baijiu.\n\nIn comparison to traditional detection techniques, the text does not provide specific information about the accuracy and sensitivity of these techniques. However, it does mention that the SERS nanosensor array is highly sensitive and can perform multiplex detection, indicating that it may have advantages over traditional techniques in terms of accuracy and sensitivity."
