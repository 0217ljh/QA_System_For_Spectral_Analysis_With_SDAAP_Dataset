        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate ABCS (change in body condition score) in this study was the mid-infrared spectra of milk. This metric was used in combination with machine learning techniques, specifically partial least squares regression and a neural network, to estimate ABCS. The study found that the inclusion of spectral data reduced the root mean square error of validation (RMSEV) and improved the correlation between actual and estimated ABCS compared to using only days in milk (DIM) as a metric. The performance of the neural network using DIM and morning spectra only was found to be robust across different strata of farm, parity, year of sampling, and breed. Therefore, the mid-infrared spectra of milk coupled with machine learning techniques can be used as a reliable metric to estimate ABCS in cows. The study did not mention any specific limitations or boundaries on how far this metric can go in estimating ABCS."

        "Output": "The statistical methods, partial least squares regression and a neural network, were used to estimate ABCS (change in body condition score) in cows using mid-infrared spectra of milk. Several combinations of variables were included as model features, such as days in milk (DIM) only, morning (a.m.) spectra only with DIM, evening (p.m.) spectra only with DIM, and both a.m. and p.m. spectra with DIM. \n\nThe data used for estimation were divided into four sub-data sets, with three sets used for training the prediction model and the fourth set used for testing. This process was repeated until all sub-data sets were considered as the test data set once. \n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using the root mean square error of validation (RMSEV) and the correlation between actual and estimated ABCS. The lowest RMSEV and strongest correlation were achieved with the neural network (NN) method. \n\nUsing all 305 days in milk (DIM) data, the NN method with both a.m. and p.m. spectra and DIM yielded the lowest RMSEV (0.96 x 10-3 BCS units) and strongest correlation (0.82) between actual and estimated ABCS. \n\nUsing the 120 DIM"

        "Output": "The use of mid-infrared spectra coupled with machine learning techniques has been found to be more accurate in estimating ABCS in cows losing body condition score at the fastest rate compared to traditional methods. The study found that including spectral data in the model reduced the root mean square error of validation (RMSEV) and improved the correlation between actual and estimated ABCS.\n\nSpecifically, when using all 305 days in milk (DIM) data, the neural network (NN) model using both morning and evening spectra along with DIM achieved the lowest RMSEV (0.96 x 10-3 BCS units) and the strongest correlation (0.82) between actual and estimated ABCS. When using the 120 DIM data, the NN model using DIM and either morning spectra only or both morning and evening spectra together achieved the lowest RMSEV (0.98 x 10-3 BCS units) and the strongest correlation (0.87) between actual and estimated ABCS.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of spectral data in the model significantly improved the accuracy of estimating ABCS for cows losing BCS at the fastest rate. The RMSEV for records in the lowest 2.5% ABCS percentile per DIM in early lactation was reduced by up to "
