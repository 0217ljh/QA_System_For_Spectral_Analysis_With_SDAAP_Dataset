According to the information provided, the conventional machine learning algorithms, including SVM and AdaBoost, achieved accuracies of 64.74% +/- 1.57% and 71.13% +/- 2.96%, respectively. In comparison, the deep learning approaches, including deep belief network and convolutional neural network models, achieved better classification accuracies of 84.26% +/- 2.58% and 72.77% +/- 1.92%, respectively. This indicates that the deep learning approaches outperformed the conventional machine learning algorithms in accurately differentiating between rest and task periods during Stroop task experiments using fNIRS."
