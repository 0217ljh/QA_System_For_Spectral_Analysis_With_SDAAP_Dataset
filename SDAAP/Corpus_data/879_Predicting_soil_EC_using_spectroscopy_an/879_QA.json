        "Output": "The results of comparing the prediction accuracy of different color coordinates and spectra combinations in predicting soil electrical conductivity (EC) using smartphone-based methods showed that combined Vis-NIR and pXRF spectra had the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.93) for predicting EC compared to individual Vis-NIR or pXRF spectra and smartphone-based and Vis-based color coordinates. This indicates that using both Vis-NIR and pXRF spectra together provides the most accurate prediction of soil EC."
