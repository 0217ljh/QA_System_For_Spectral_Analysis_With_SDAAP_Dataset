        "input": "",
        "Output": "The THz time-domain spectra were transformed into frequency spectra by Fourier transform, and then simplified formulas of the optical parameters were used to obtain the THz absorption spectra and refractive index spectra."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to quantify the potassium sorbate content in milk powder is the absorption spectra obtained from the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system (THz-TDS). By analyzing the characteristic absorption peak of potassium sorbate in the THz absorption spectra, a quantitative analysis model of potassium sorbate in milk powder was constructed using ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the investigation of the potassium sorbate content in milk powder using THz-TDS, two machine learning models were used. The first model is ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, which was used for quantitative analysis to construct a model for potassium sorbate content in milk powder. The second model is partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), which was used for qualitative analysis to discriminate between different samples based on their potassium sorbate content."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the Sub-PLS model can be used to accurately analyze low content of potassium sorbate in milk powder using THz-TDS in the related study. The experimental results show that the proposed Sub-PLS model is superior to the PLS model based on the full spectrum in accuracy."
