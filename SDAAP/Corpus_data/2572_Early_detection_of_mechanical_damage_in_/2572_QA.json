        "Output": "The metric chosen to classify the skin of the mangos as sound or damaged was the rate of correct classification of pixels. The accuracy of this metric was 97.9% on the third day after the damage had been caused when using k-Nearest Neighbours and the whole spectra. However, when only the most discriminant bands were used, the accuracy dropped to 91.4%."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of hyperspectral imaging and the analysis of whole spectra can effectively detect and classify mechanically induced damage in 'Manila' mangos, even in the early stages of maturity, as demonstrated in the related study. The study achieved a 97.9% rate of correct classification of pixels on the third day after the damage had been caused using k-Nearest Neighbours and the whole spectra. This indicates that the hyperspectral imaging system was able to accurately identify and classify the damaged areas of the mango fruit."
