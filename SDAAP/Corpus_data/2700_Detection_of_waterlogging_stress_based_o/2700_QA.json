        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers used three machine learning models, namely Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to detect oilseed rape waterlogging stress in hyperspectral images. They built classification models using these models to compare images and spectra of oilseed rape leaves under different durations of waterlogging stress. The models were trained and tested using three datasets: one for the non-hybrid oilseed rape variety NingYou 22 (NY 22), one for the hybrid variety NingZa 19 (NZ 19), and one combining both varieties. \n\nFor the classification of full-wavelength hyperspectral images (400-1000 nm), QDA and SVM achieved high multivariate classification accuracy, with QDA reaching 77.37% accuracy and SVM reaching 95.90% accuracy. On the other hand, KNN displayed lower accuracy but showed good identification and prediction ability specifically for the NZ 19 variety. \n\nAdditionally, the researchers used the Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) to identify six optimal wavebands (529, 641, 698, 749, 856, and 979 nm) for classification and analysis."

        "Output": "The classification accuracy of QDA and SVM for full-wavelength HSIs is higher compared to the accuracy of KNN for detecting oilseed rape waterlogging stress in hyperspectral images. QDA achieved a multivariate classification accuracy of 77.37%, while SVM reached an even higher accuracy of 95.90%. In contrast, KNN displayed low accuracy in the related study."
