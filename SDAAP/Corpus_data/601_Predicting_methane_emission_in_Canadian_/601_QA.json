        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the models is the correlation coefficient (r) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted and actual CH4 emissions, with values ranging from -1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while a value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual CH4 emissions, with lower values indicating better accuracy.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the correlation coefficient (r) ranged from 0.245 to 0.727 across the different predictor sets and validation sets. This means that the models were able to explain between 24.5% and 72.7% of the variation in CH4 emissions. The root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 68.02 to 154.44, indicating that the average difference between the predicted and actual CH4 emissions ranged from 68.02 to 154.44 units. \n\nOverall, the models using the MIRS data (set 7 and set 8) yielded significantly better predictions compared to the other sets, with higher correlation coefficients and lower RMSE values.

        "Output": "The use of milk mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) data was found to be more effective in predicting CH4 emissions in lactating Canadian Holstein cows compared to traditional prediction methods. The related study compared various predictor sets, including different milk yield and composition variables, as well as MIRS data. \n\nWhen using only traditional predictors such as milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), and protein yield (PY), the predictive accuracy (r) ranged from 0.245 to 0.468, and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 86.95 to 100.94. Adding these traditional predictors together (set 6) yielded slightly lower accuracy compared to sets using only MY or FY.\n\nHowever, when using only MIRS data (set 7), the predictive accuracy ranged from 0.586 to 0.717, and the RMSE ranged from 69.09 to 96.20. This indicates that MIRS data alone provided superior accuracy compared to traditional predictors.\n\nFurthermore, when combining MIRS data with traditional predictors (set 8), the predictive accuracy ranged from 0.590 to 0.727, and the RMSE ranged from 68.02 to 87.78. This combination yielded similar"
