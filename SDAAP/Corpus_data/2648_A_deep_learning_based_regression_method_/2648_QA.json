        "Output": "The purpose of using stacked auto-encoders (SAE) and partial least squares support vector machine regression (LSSVR) in the study was to obtain depth features and establish a detection model for cadmium (Cd) content in lettuce leaves. The SAE was used to acquire optimum wavelengths, while LSSVR models were built using characteristic wavelengths. This combination of deep learning and regression techniques aimed to effectively detect heavy metal content in lettuce leaves using spectral data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the deep learning method using stacked auto-encoders (SAE) and partial least squares support vector machine regression (LSSVR) can be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting the content of cadmium (Cd) in lettuce leaves using Vis-NIR hyperspectral images. The study showed that the SAE-LSSVR method achieved the best prediction performance with an R-p(2) of 0.9487, RMSEP of 0.01049 mg/kg, and RPD of 3.330. This indicates that the deep learning method coupled with hyperspectral imaging technique has great potential for detecting heavy metal content in lettuce leaves, surpassing traditional methods."
