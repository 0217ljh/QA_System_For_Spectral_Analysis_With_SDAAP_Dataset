R-2 measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (grain-size parameters) that can be explained by the independent variables (band indices). RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values of the grain-size parameters.\n\nThe text does not provide information on how far this metric can go."

        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, it is not possible to determine whether spectroscopic methods are considered superior to traditional methods for mapping the distributions of sediment grain size contents and mean grain size along the southwestern coast of Laizhou Bay, China, using remote sensing techniques. The text mentions the use of a support vector machine (SVM) and a back propagation neural network (BPNN) for calibrating grain-size parameters, but it does not specifically mention the use of spectroscopic methods. Therefore, more information is needed to make a conclusion about the superiority of spectroscopic methods in this context."
