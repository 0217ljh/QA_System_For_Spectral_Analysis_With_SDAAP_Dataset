        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for evaluating the predictive performance in the for the quantitative analysis of THC in cannabis products study is the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP). The RMSEP is a measure of the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, and it provides an indication of the accuracy of the predictive model. In the for the quantitative analysis of THC in cannabis products study, the RMSEP was reported to be 1.75% (w/w) for the prediction of THC concentration in cannabis inflorescence samples using the developed chemometric model based on machine learning ensemble algorithms. This indicates that, on average, the predicted THC concentrations deviated from the actual concentrations by approximately 1.75% (w/w)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the predictive performance of the machine learning ensemble algorithms by using the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP). The RMSEP value obtained was 1.75% (w/w), indicating good predictive performance. Additionally, the Bland-Altman method was used to compare the NIR predictions to the quantitative results obtained by UHPLC-UV. The results from both techniques fell within the established limits of agreement, demonstrating the feasibility of the chemometric model for analytical purposes."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The mid-cost NIR spectrophotometer can be considered superior to the low-cost device in terms of predictive performance for analyzing THC concentration in cannabis inflorescences and resin samples. The related study compared the performance of the two handheld NIR spectrophotometers and found that the mid-cost system outperformed the low-cost system, especially when analyzing entire cannabis inflorescences. The results were comparable for more homogeneous forms of cannabis. Additionally, when resin samples were investigated, the mid-cost spectrophotometer significantly outperformed the low-cost device in terms of prediction accuracy and reproducibility."
