        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification models was the modelling effect. The modelling effect of the spectral data processed by SG was found to be the best. This metric can go far in identifying sound and slightly sprouted wheat kernels, as it significantly improved the performance of the LDA and SVM models, particularly in distinguishing between the two types of kernels."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, according to the provided related study, the use of reverse side spectral data in near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology can be considered superior to using ventral side spectral data in identifying sound and slightly sprouted wheat kernels. The study found that the modelling effect of using the reverse side spectral data was slightly better than the ventral side spectral data. Additionally, the results showed that calibrating the model with the hyperspectral data on the reverse side of wheat kernels was more helpful in identifying sound and slightly sprouted wheat kernels."
