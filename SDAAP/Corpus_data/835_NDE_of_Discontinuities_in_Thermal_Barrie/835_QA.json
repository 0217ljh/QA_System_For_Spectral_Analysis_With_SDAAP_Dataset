        "Output": "Yes, the proposed technique that combines terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and machine learning classifiers can be used to classify TBC discontinuities more accurately and efficiently compared to traditional methods. The results of the study show that the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, when combined with principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and the Grid Search method for hyperparameter optimization, achieved an average accuracy of 94.3% and a running time of 65.6 ms. This indicates that the proposed technique has a high level of accuracy in identifying discontinuities in TBCs and can do so in a relatively short amount of time. Compared to traditional methods, which may rely on manual inspection or less advanced analysis techniques, the combination of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and machine learning classifiers offers a more efficient and accurate approach to classifying TBC discontinuities."
