        "Output": "Yes, the low-cost, portable, multispectral, AI-based, non-destructive spectroscopic sensor system developed in this research can be considered superior to traditional laboratory-based detection methods for detecting milk adulterants. This is because the traditional laboratory-based methods are time-consuming, expensive, and may not be affordable for the common man. In contrast, the sensor system is designed to be cost-effective, portable, and capable of real-time detection. It utilizes spectroscopic techniques with three different bands (UV, visible, and IR spectrum) to improve the accuracy of detection. Additionally, the sensor system is connected to the internet via an IoT application, allowing for immediate publication of detected adulterant results with location information, thereby enhancing transparency. The system also employs machine learning algorithms, including decision tree, Naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and neural network models, to solve the adulterant detection problem as a classification problem. The average accuracy of these models ranges from 88.1% to 92.7%, with further improvement achieved through hyperparameter tuning using a genetic algorithm framework. Overall, the combination of affordability, portability, real-time detection, and high accuracy makes the developed sensor system superior to traditional laboratory-based methods for detecting milk adulter"
