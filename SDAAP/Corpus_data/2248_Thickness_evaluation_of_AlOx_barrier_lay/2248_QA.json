Machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be easily detectable by traditional methods. This allows for more accurate and efficient determination of the thickness of the AlOx layers, making the methodology suitable for industrial monitoring applications. Additionally, machine learning algorithms can be trained to continuously improve their accuracy over time, providing a flexible and adaptable solution for thickness control in roll-to-roll production lines."

The methodology has been demonstrated to have a sensitivity of less than 10 nm and acquisition times of less than or equal to 100 ms, making it compatible with industrial monitoring applications. This means that it can be easily incorporated into roll-to-roll production lines for thickness control of nanometric layers."
