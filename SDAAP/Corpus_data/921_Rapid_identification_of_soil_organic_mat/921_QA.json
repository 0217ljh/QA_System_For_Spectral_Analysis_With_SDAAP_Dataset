        "Output": "Yes, the TRI-ELM method, which utilizes visible and near-infrared spectroscopy, can be considered a superior alternative to traditional methods for accurately estimating soil organic matter (SOM) fertility levels. The related study compared the performance of the TRI-ELM method with that of support vector machine (SVM) models. The results showed that the TRI-ELM method yielded superior predictability relative to SVM models in all eight established models. The most excellent estimation accuracy was obtained by the TRI-ELM method, with an independent validation R-2 and a ratio of performance to interquartile range of 0.83 and 3.49, respectively. Additionally, the TRI-ELM method presented the largest similarity to laboratory-measured SOM levels, with misclassified samples concentrated within one error level. Therefore, based on these findings, the TRI-ELM method can be considered a rapid, inexpensive, and relatively accurate method for identifying SOM fertility levels."
