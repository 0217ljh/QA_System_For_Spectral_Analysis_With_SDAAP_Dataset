        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of collections of germplasm accessions of major crops was classification accuracy. This metric measures the number of predictions correctly predicted divided by the total number of predictions made, multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. It can provide valuable information for breeding purposes and has shown high precision in different environmental conditions."

        "Output": "Yes, the spectral-based classification approach using machine-learning models can be considered superior to traditional methods for assigning wheat cultivars to genetically differentiated subpopulations, particularly in the context of different water regimes (rainfed and fully irrigated). The related study used different machine-learning models trained with foliar spectral and genetic information to assign wheat cultivars to subpopulations. The results showed that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was significantly more accurate in classifying individuals into their respective subpopulations, with 92% and 93% of correct individual assignments in water-limited and fully irrigated environments, respectively. This indicates that the spectral-based classification approach using machine-learning models can accurately infer the belonging of a cultivar to its respective genetically differentiated group, even considering radically different environments."
