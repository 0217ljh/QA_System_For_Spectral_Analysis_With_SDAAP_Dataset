        "input": "",
        "Output": "The U-Net and 1D-CNN frameworks were utilized in the HMI technology combined with CNN for the rapid detection and classification of foodborne bacterial species at the cellular level as follows:\n\n1. U-Net: The U-Net framework was used for automating cellular regions of interest (ROI) segmentation. This means that it was employed to identify and isolate the specific regions within the images that contained bacterial cells. By generating accurate cell-ROI masks, the U-Net framework enabled the identification of bacterial cells in a shorter timeframe compared to traditional methods like Otsu or Watershed.\n\n2. 1D-CNN: The 1D-CNN framework was employed for classifying the spectral profiles extracted from the cell-ROI. After the cellular regions of interest were identified using the U-Net framework, the spectral information of the bacterial cells was extracted. The 1D-CNN framework then analyzed these spectral profiles and classified them into different bacterial species. The classification accuracy achieved by the 1D-CNN framework was higher (90%) compared to other classification methods like k-nearest neighbor (81%) and support vector machine (81%)."
