        "Output": "Yes, the combination of visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy, remote sensing, and topographic data can be considered a superior method for predicting the spatial variability of soil properties compared to traditional methods in assessing agricultural land in western Iran. The related study used a hybrid model called RF + PSO, which integrated these data sources and achieved higher accuracy in predicting soil clay content, electrical conductivity (EC), and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) compared to other scenarios. The results demonstrated that the combination of Vis-NIR spectroscopic data and commonly available environmental covariates provided the best input data for the hybridized model and enhanced its performance. Therefore, this approach can be considered a more efficient and low-cost solution for addressing land degradation and ensuring sustainable soil and crop management in the region."
