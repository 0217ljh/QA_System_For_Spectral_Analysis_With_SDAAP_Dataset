The convolutional neural network is used to establish a classification model based on visible and near-infrared spectroscopy technology, which can effectively and nondestructively classify different types of soil.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of convolutional neural network (CNN) for land cover classification with small samples can be considered as a superior method compared to traditional classification methods. The past study states that compared with traditional methods, visible and near-infrared spectroscopy technology combined with CNN can classify different types of soil rapidly, effectively, and nondestructively. The classification results of different numbers of training samples using CNN are analyzed and compared with the support vector machine algorithm, and the CNN consistently performs better. Additionally, even under the condition of randomly dividing the calibration set, the classification results by CNN are still better. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that CNN is a superior method for land cover classification with small samples compared to traditional methods."
