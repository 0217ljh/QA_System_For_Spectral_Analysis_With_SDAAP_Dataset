        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the machine learning models in the related study was the R-2 (R-squared) value and the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (SPAD value) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral data or multispectral images). It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted SPAD values and the actual SPAD values, providing an indication of the model's accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The GLM model established by spectral data was found to be the optimal model among all the models for estimating photosynthetic pigments in crops. This suggests that the GLM model outperformed traditional methods in accurately estimating the levels of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids in crops."
