        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the models on predicting catechin content in black tea during fermentation is the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect prediction. In the related study, the prediction accuracy for the total amount of catechins and for epicatechin gallate (ECG) reached 0.989 and 0.994, respectively. The prediction accuracy for EGC, C, EC, and EGCG of the content support vector regression (SVR) models reached 0.972, 0.993, 0.990, and 0.994, respectively. These high R-squared values indicate that the models have a strong ability to predict catechin content."
