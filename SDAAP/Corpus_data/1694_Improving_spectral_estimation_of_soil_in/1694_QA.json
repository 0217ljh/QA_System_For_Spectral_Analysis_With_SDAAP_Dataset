        "Output": "The metric chosen in the study for estimating soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in urban and suburban areas was the coefficient of determination (R2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the SIC values that can be explained by the models developed using the vis-NIR spectral data. The study found that the highest validation R2 value achieved was 0.73 when stratifying the urban soil spectral library (SSL) by land-use/land-cover (LULC) and using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scale 1. This indicates that the models developed using the vis-NIR technique combined with LULC stratification and machine/deep learning can explain approximately 73% of the variance in SIC values in urban soils."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of vis-NIR technique, LULC stratification, and machine/deep learning can be considered a superior method for predicting soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in urban and suburban areas compared to traditional methods. The study mentioned in the text established an urban soil spectral library (SSL) with 3492 samples in Wuhan City, China and used five modeling approaches for SIC prediction. The results showed that stratification by land-use/land-cover (LULC) resulted in improved accuracy compared to a non-stratified model. Additionally, the use of machine/deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and autoencoder-based residual deep network showed promising results. The combination of these advanced techniques with the vis-NIR technique and LULC stratification has the potential to provide more accurate predictions of SIC in urban and suburban areas compared to traditional methods."
