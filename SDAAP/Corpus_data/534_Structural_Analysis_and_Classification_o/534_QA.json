        "Output": "The metric used in the analysis of the structural differences between LMWHA-A and LMWHA-E was classification accuracy. The accuracy of the classification was measured in both the training dataset and the test dataset. The accuracy of the traditional machine learning methods (PLS-DA, SVC, and RF) in the test dataset was reported to be 90%. On the other hand, the accuracy of the deep learning models (1D-CNN and LSTM) in both the training dataset and the test dataset classification was reported to be 100%."

        "Output": "Yes. According to the results of the related study, the use of deep learning models, specifically the 1D-CNN and LSTM models, in the classification of LMWHA-A and LMWHA-E based on near-infrared spectroscopy and machine learning can be considered superior to traditional machine learning methods. The deep learning models achieved a classification accuracy of 100% in both the training and test datasets, while the best performers among the traditional machine learning methods, GA-SVC and RF, had a maximum accuracy of 90% in the test dataset. Therefore, the related study suggests that deep learning models provide a better classification performance for these biological macromolecules."
