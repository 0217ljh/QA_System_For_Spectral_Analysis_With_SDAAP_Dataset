        "Output": "The combination of NIR spectroscopy and machine learning methods is considered to be a reliable approach for evaluating peanuts for efficient processing. The classification models built using partial least squares discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest showed high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, with all values over 90%. Additionally, the feature extraction methods, such as PCA, variable importance, and random forest selection, were effective in extracting relevant information from the spectral data. The kernel density estimation also provided acceptable distribution results of categories probabilities in the selected models. Overall, these findings suggest that the combination of NIR spectroscopy and machine learning methods can provide a dependable evaluation of peanuts for efficient processing."
