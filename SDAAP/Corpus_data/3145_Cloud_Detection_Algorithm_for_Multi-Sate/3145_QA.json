In the CD-SLCNN method, residual learning is used to accurately capture the spectral information of the pixels based on the prior spectral library. This helps to effectively prevent errors that may occur due to uncertainties in thin clouds, broken clouds, and clear-sky pixels during remote sensing interpretation.\n\nOne-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) is a type of convolutional neural network that is specifically designed to process one-dimensional data, such as spectral information. In the CD-SLCNN method, the Res-1D-CNN is used to capture the spectral information of the pixels. By using this architecture, the CD-SLCNN method is able to accurately capture the spectral characteristics of the pixels and distinguish between cloud and non-cloud regions.\n\nBy combining residual learning and one-dimensional CNN, the CD-SLCNN method effectively captures the spectral information of the pixels based on the prior spectral library.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The CD-SLCNN method outperforms traditional cloud detection methods in terms of accuracy and performance on different types of multispectral data. The comparison of the CD-SLCNN method with other methods such as the function of the mask, MODIS cloud mask, support vector machine, and random forest revealed that the CD-SLCNN method achieved the best performance. It had a higher overall accuracy (95.6%, 95.36%, 94.27%) and mean intersection over union (77.82%, 77.94%, 77.23%) on Landsat-8 OLI, MODIS, and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. \n\nThe CD-SLCNN algorithm produced consistent results with a more accurate cloud contour on thick, thin, and broken clouds over diverse underlying surfaces. It also demonstrated stable performance on bright surfaces like buildings, ice, and snow. This indicates that the CD-SLCNN method is effective in accurately detecting clouds in different types of multispectral data, surpassing the performance of traditional methods."
