The traditional method mentioned in the text involves using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, which requires a clean and flat metal surface and involves enormous equipment costs. In contrast, the proposed method utilizes the ResNet18 network model, which improves identification efficiency and reduces equipment costs. By using machine vision algorithms and different datasets, the proposed method achieves a 100% accuracy in the classification and recognition of different grades of aluminum scrap. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed method is more efficient and cost-effective compared to traditional methods."
