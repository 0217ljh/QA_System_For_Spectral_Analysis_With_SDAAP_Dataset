In external validation, the SVM-based prediction model for both white and brown rice showed good performance, with an accuracy of 1.0.\n\nThese findings suggest that machine learning techniques based on NMR data can effectively differentiate and predict the geographical origins of white and brown rice. Compared to traditional methods, machine learning algorithms can provide more accurate and reliable predictions, making them superior."
