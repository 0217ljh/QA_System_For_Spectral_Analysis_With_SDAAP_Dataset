        "Output": "The PLSR and ELM models were used to verify the effectiveness of the band extraction method proposed in the study by evaluating the correlation coefficients and prediction accuracy. The researchers applied the three-step extraction method to select characteristic bands corresponding to various spectral forms. Then, they used the PLSR and ELM models to establish models based on the selected bands.\n\nThe correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between the spectrum and nickel (Ni) content. The results showed that the differential transformation of the spectrum using the proposed method significantly improved the correlation coefficients. Most correlation coefficients were above 0.7 and approximately 20% higher than those obtained using other transformation methods.\n\nThe prediction accuracy of the models was evaluated using the RPD (Ratio of Performance to Deviation) values. The RPD values of the PLSR model were concentrated between 1.6 and 1.8, while those of the ELM model were between 2.5 and 2.9. This indicates that the band extraction method, combined with the ELM algorithm, was able to retain important bands associated with the Ni content of the soil and extract more complete spectral features.\n\nOverall, the PLSR and ELM models were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the band extraction method by showing"

        "Output": "The three-step extraction method proposed in the study is compared to traditional feature band extraction methods in terms of improving the correlation between the spectrum and nickel (Ni) content. The results show that the differential transformation of the spectrum using the three-step extraction method effectively improves the correlation between the spectrum and Ni content. Most correlation coefficients obtained using this method were above 0.7, which is approximately 20% higher than those obtained using other transformation methods. This indicates that the three-step extraction method is more effective in improving the correlation between the spectrum and Ni content compared to traditional feature band extraction methods."
