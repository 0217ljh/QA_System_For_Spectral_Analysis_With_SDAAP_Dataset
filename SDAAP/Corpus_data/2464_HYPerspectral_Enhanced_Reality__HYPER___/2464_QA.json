        "Output": "Yes, according to the related study, the experimental study found that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) accurately quantified bowel perfusion and obtained a superposition of hyperspectral information onto real-time images. The HSI system provided pseudo-color maps of the perfusion status, including oxygenation levels (StO2) and Near-InfraRed perfusion. The HSI information was then superimposed onto live video, creating a technique called HYPerspectral-based Enhanced Reality (HYPER). The study demonstrated that the HSI parameters were congruent with measurements of local capillary lactates, reactive oxygen species production, and histopathology damage scores at specific regions of interest in the bowel loops. Additionally, a machine-learning-based prediction algorithm trained on the HSI-StO2% values accurately predicted local capillary lactate levels. Therefore, the study concluded that HYPER imaging using HSI could precisely quantify the changes in bowel perfusion over time in the bowel ischemia model."
