However, it is mentioned that the SVM classification model based on the full wavelengths achieved a classification accuracy of 95.19%, and the LDA classification model based on selected feature wavelengths achieved a classification accuracy of 82.69%. These classification accuracies indicate the percentage of correctly classified soybean varieties using the respective models. \n\nBased on the information provided, it is not possible to determine how far this metric can go. The text does not provide any additional information or context regarding the potential upper limit or range of classification accuracy for soybean varieties using hyperspectral imaging technology and the mentioned classification models."
