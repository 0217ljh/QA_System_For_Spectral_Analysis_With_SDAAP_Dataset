The traditional method mentioned in the related study is an alternating optimization scheme using a linear-support vector machine that optimizes classification weights and lighting weights separately. \n\nIn comparison to this traditional method, the proposed method, which is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), showed superior performance in reducing training loss. The results of the five-fold cross-validation revealed that the proposed method improved the F1-score, indicating better accuracy in classification, compared to the previous method using the immutable standard illuminant D-65. \n\nTherefore, the proposed method for optimizing the light-source spectrum is more effective in reducing training loss in machine vision using deep learning compared to traditional methods."
