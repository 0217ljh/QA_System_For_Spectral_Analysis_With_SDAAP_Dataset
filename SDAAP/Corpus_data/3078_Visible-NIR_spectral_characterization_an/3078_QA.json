These metrics provide a quantitative measure of how well the models predict the copper grade of the ore samples.\n\nThe R2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit between the predicted and actual values. In the related study, the R2 value of the best model (LLE-RBF) is reported to be 0.934, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual copper grades.\n\nThe MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values. In this study, the MAE of the LLE-RBF model is reported to be 0.117%, indicating that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual values by 0.117%.\n\nThe RMSE measures the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. In this study, the RMSE of the LLE-RBF model is reported to be 0.136, indicating the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values is "

This reduction in dimensionality helped to eliminate irrelevant or redundant information, making the data more manageable and easier to analyze.

These algorithms have the ability to learn from the data and make predictions based on patterns and relationships within the dataset. By utilizing these machine learning algorithms, the models were able to capture the complex relationships between the spectral data and the copper grade, leading to more accurate predictions.\n\nFurthermore, the accurate selection of dimensionality reduction algorithms and machine learning algorithms was crucial in determining the accuracy of the inverse model.
