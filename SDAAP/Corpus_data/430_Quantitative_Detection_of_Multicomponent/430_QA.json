        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the quantitative calibration model is the determination coefficient (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (SF6 decomposition products concentration) that can be explained by the independent variables (absorption spectra and selected features). \n\nThe text states that the R-2 value of the CARS-ELM model reached 0.9997, which indicates a very high level of accuracy and precision in predicting the concentration of SF6 decomposition products. This suggests that the model is able to explain 99.97% of the variance in the dependent variable based on the selected independent variables."

ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) Model: This model was used as a baseline model for quantitative calibration. It was established using the processed experimental data after baseline correction and abnormal sample point detection.\n\n2. CC-ELM (Correlation Coefficient-ELM) Model: This model was established by combining the feature selection algorithm based on correlation coefficient (CC) with the ELM model. The CC algorithm was used to select the most relevant features from the processed experimental data before training the ELM model.\n\n3. CARS-ELM (Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling-ELM) Model: This model was established by combining the feature selection algorithm based on competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) with the ELM model. The CARS algorithm was used to select the most informative and representative samples from the processed experimental data before training the ELM model.\n\nThe performance of these three models was evaluated based on determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The CARS-ELM model outperforms the other two models (ELM and CC-ELM) in terms of evaluation indexes and performance for the quantitative detection of SF6 decomposition products concentration in GIS using FTIR spectroscopy. The determination coefficient (R-2) of the CARS-ELM model reached 0.9997, which is higher than the previous two models. Additionally, the CARS-ELM model showed better performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to the other models. The maximum relative error of prediction results for the three products under the high concentration of SF6 interference did not exceed 1.7% in the CARS-ELM model. Therefore, the results indicate that the FTIR spectroscopy combined with the CARS-ELM model is an effective method for achieving high precision quantitative detection of multicomponent SF6 decomposition products."
