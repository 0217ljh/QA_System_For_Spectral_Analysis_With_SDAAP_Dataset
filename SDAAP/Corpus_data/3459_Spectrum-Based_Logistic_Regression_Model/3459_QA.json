        "Output": "Yes, the use of spectral data as features for logistic regression models can be considered superior to traditional methods in quantitatively characterizing different types of sea bottom using CHIRP-recorded data. The examination results mentioned in the related study indicate that logistic regression models applied to either the backscatter time series or the spectrum of the backscatter achieved high accuracy in characterizing the types of sea bottom. The accuracy reached 90% for the time series and 94% for the spectra. This suggests that using spectral data as features in logistic regression models can provide more accurate and reliable results compared to traditional methods."
