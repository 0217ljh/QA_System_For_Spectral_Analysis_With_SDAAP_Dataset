        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning approaches were utilized to predict the botanical origin of honey samples using near infrared spectroscopy. Three different classifiers were built on distinct multivariate and machine learning approaches. \n\nThe first approach used a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to build a predictive model for honey classification. Spectra pretreatments such as autoscale, standard normal variate, detrending, first derivative, and smoothing were applied to reduce scattering related to the presence of particle size. This approach allowed for a sufficient floral group prediction for acacia and polyfloral honeys, but not for chestnut and linden honeys.\n\nThe second classifier was based on a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a better classification of acacia and polyfloral honeys. It also achieved the classification of chestnut honeys. However, the linden samples remained unclassified using this approach.\n\nTo further improve the botanical discrimination, a feature selection algorithm called Boruta was utilized. Boruta assigned a pool of 39 informative averaged near infrared spectral variables. A canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was then assessed using these variables. The CDA accounted for a better separation of samples according to the botanical origin compared to the PLS-DA.\n\nOverall,"

        "Output": "Near infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometric approaches shows promise as a method for predicting the botanical origin of honey samples. The study evaluated the feasibility of this approach and compared it to traditional methods. Different classifiers were built using multivariate and machine learning approaches, such as partial least squares discriminant analysis and support vector machine. \n\nThe results showed that the partial least squares discriminant analysis model allowed for a sufficient prediction of the floral group for acacia and polyfloral honeys. However, it was not as successful in classifying chestnut and linden honeys. The support vector machine classifier performed better, achieving a better classification for acacia and polyfloral honeys, and also successfully classifying chestnut honeys. However, the linden honeys remained unclassified.\n\nTo further improve the botanical discrimination, a feature selection algorithm called Boruta was used. This algorithm identified 39 informative near infrared spectral variables, which were then used in a canonical discriminant analysis. This approach resulted in a better separation of samples according to their botanical origin compared to the partial least squares discriminant analysis.\n\nOverall, the result suggests that near infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometric approaches has the potential to be a superior method for predicting the botanical origin"
