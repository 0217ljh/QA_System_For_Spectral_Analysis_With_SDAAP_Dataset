        "Output": "Yes. Near-infrared spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional chemical analysis for real-time textile fabrics classification. The study found that the combination of near-infrared spectroscopy and pattern recognition methods achieved a classification accuracy of 100% for the prediction set. Additionally, the extreme learning machine, which utilized near-infrared spectroscopy, performed much faster than the traditional least squares support machine. This suggests that near-infrared spectroscopy has the potential to provide real-time classification with comparable accuracy, while avoiding the time-consuming and costly chemical analysis typically required for textile fabrics classification."
