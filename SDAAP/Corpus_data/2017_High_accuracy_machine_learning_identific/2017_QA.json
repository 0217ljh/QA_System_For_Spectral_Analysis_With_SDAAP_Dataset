        "Output": "Yes, the achieved average accuracy rate of 92.5% in identifying fentanyl-related functional groups using machine learning and spectral properties can be considered superior to traditional methods for rapid detection of fentanyl and its derivatives. Traditional methods may involve manual analysis or chemical tests, which can be time-consuming and may not provide accurate results. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, leading to more efficient and reliable detection of fentanyl and its derivatives."
