        "Output": "The CNN was initially trained on a broad spectral database collected from various (bio)samples.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of a functional SERS substrate and CNN transfer learning can be considered a superior spectroscopic method for the quantitative detection of AGP in human serum compared to traditional methods. Traditional methods for quantitative analysis of AGP in human serum may be challenging and almost impossible due to the complexity of (bio)samples and the need for advanced spectral data analysis. However, the proposed combination of a functional SERS substrate, capable of trapping target biomolecules, with CNN transfer learning provides a highly sensitive and reliable approach for quantitative detection. The functional SERS substrate, in this case, is a plasmonic gold grating functionalized with boronic acid moieties to entrap target AGP. The CNN transfer learning algorithm has been trained on a large number of (bio)samples, enabling it to accurately quantify AGP concentration in model samples and human serum. This approach allows for the identification of alarming increases in AGP concentration in an express and medically decentralized manner, even in situations where there is a lack of spectral data. Additionally, this method can be applied to similar model systems, eliminating the need for the collection of real samples and ensuring analysis reliability. Overall, the combination of a functional SERS substrate and CNN transfer learning offers a superior alternative to traditional methods for the quantitative detection"
