        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the regression models in phosphorus determination using LIBS is the coefficient of determination (R-2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the phosphorus concentration that can be explained by the regression model. The obtained R-2 value for the non-linear SVM model was 0.9904. This indicates that the SVM model can explain approximately 99.04% of the variance in the phosphorus concentration. \n\nThe R-2 value can range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 represents a perfect fit of the model to the data. In the past study, the achieved R-2 value of 0.9904 suggests a very high level of accuracy and predictive power for the SVM model in phosphorus determination using LIBS."

        "Output": "The researchers compared the performance of different regression models in phosphorus determination using LIBS by evaluating their figures-of-merit. They specifically compared the traditional univariate model, the linear PLS model, and the non-linear SVM model. The figures-of-merit used for comparison included R-2 (coefficient of determination), RMSEC (root mean square error of calibration), RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction), ARE (average relative error), and RSD (relative standard deviation) of prediction. Based on these figures-of-merit, they determined that the non-linear SVM model provided the best performance in terms of accuracy and precision."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the non-linear SVM model in phosphorus determination using LIBS is superior to other regression models, considering the correction for the matrix effect. The non-linear SVM model provided the best figures-of-merit with an R-2 value of 0.9904, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual phosphorus values. The root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for the SVM model were 1.68 g/kg and 1.42 g/kg, respectively. These values indicate the accuracy of the model in predicting phosphorus content in seafood samples. Additionally, the average relative standard deviation (RSD) of prediction for the SVM model was 5.18%, which is lower than the RSD values for the linear partial least squares (PLS) model (9.40%) and comparable to the univariate model (4.11%). This suggests that the SVM model is more robust in addressing the non-linear behaviors caused by the matrix effect in LIBS spectra, leading to improved analytical performance. Overall, the non-linear SVM model outperforms other regression models in phosphorus determination using LIBS, considering the correction for the matrix effect."
