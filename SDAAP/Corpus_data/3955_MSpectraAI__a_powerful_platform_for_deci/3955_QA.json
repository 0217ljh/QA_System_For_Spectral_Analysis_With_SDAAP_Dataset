This platform involved spectral-feature swath extraction, classification, and visualization. It allowed users to create their own deep neural network (DNN) model using Keras. The researchers collected publicly available proteomics datasets of six tumor types and classified the samples based on the spectra profiling using MSpectraAI. The results showed that MSpectraAI was able to distinguish different types of samples based on the fingerprint spectrum and achieved better prediction accuracy in MS1 level."
