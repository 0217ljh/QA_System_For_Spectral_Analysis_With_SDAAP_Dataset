        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) and machine/deep learning techniques can be considered superior to traditional methods for comprehensive off-flavor profiling in salmonid products, based on the discrimination accuracy achieved in the related study. The study found that the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) achieved the highest discrimination accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of machine/deep learning techniques in accurately identifying off-flavor salmonids. This suggests that NIR-HSI combined with machine/deep learning can provide a more comprehensive and accurate approach for off-flavor profiling compared to traditional methods."
