        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the evaluation of multispectral imaging for monitoring beef filet spoilage, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was developed and utilized. This model was used to provide quantitative estimations of microbial counts during storage. The SVR model was trained using the spectral data acquired from the surface of meat samples, along with microbiological analysis. It was then used to predict the microbial counts based on the multispectral imaging data. The performance of the SVR model was assessed by comparing its predictions with the actual microbial counts obtained from the microbiological analysis. The results showed that the SVR model had a good performance, with an overall correct classification rate ranging from 89.2% to 80.8% for the two quality classes. Additionally, the regression analysis resulted in an R-square value of 0.98, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual microbial counts."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Multispectral imaging was found to be effective in discriminating between different microbiological quality classes of meat samples in the study evaluating the spoilage of aerobically packaged beef filet. The qualitative analysis based on total viable counts (TVC) showed that the imaging technique was able to classify meat samples into two quality classes (TVC < 2log(10) CFU/g and TVC > 2log(10) CFU/g) with an overall correct classification rate ranging from 89.2% to 80.8% during model validation. This indicates that multispectral imaging can accurately differentiate between meat samples of different microbiological quality."
