This metric can go as far as identifying plant conditions (symptomatic versus asymptomatic) and selecting the best model for identifying plant conditions using three algorithms (logistic regression\u2014LR, random forest\u2014RF, conditional inference tree\u2014CIT) and three options for data input using only bands (reduced model), only VIs, and bands plus VIs (full model)."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of the green and near-infrared spectral bands, along with the conditional inference tree (CIT) algorithm, can be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting nematode damage in soybeans using multispectral reflectance sensors. According to the study, the greatest classification accuracy (>0.70) was achieved when using the CIT algorithm with the spectral bands only, with green (560 +/- 20 nm) and near-infrared (840 +/- 40 nm) included as the main spectral input variables in the model. This demonstrates the potential of combining remotely sensed data and machine learning to distinguish nematode-symptomatic and asymptomatic soybean plants, suggesting that this approach can outperform traditional methods for detecting nematode damage."
