        "Output": "The advantages of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) compared to traditional machine learning algorithms for tea quality control using NIR spectroscopy are as follows:\n\n1. Higher accuracy: The experimental results indicate that CNNs such as TeaNet, TeaResnet, and TeaMobilenet can achieve up to a 100% accuracy rate, breaking through the accuracy bottleneck of traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. This suggests that CNNs are more effective in accurately classifying tea based on NIR data.\n\n2. Ability to handle complex data: CNNs are designed to handle complex data such as images, and in this case, NIR data transformed into pseudo images. This allows the model to exploit the information in NIR data more effectively, leading to improved classification performance.\n\n3. Feature extraction: CNNs are capable of automatically learning and extracting relevant features from the input data. This eliminates the need for manual feature engineering, which is often required in traditional machine learning algorithms. By automatically learning features, CNNs can capture more intricate patterns and nuances in the tea NIR data, leading to better classification results.\n\n4. Environmental friendliness and speed: NIR spectroscopy is used to collect the tea NIR data in a fast, noninvasive, and environmentally friendly manner"
