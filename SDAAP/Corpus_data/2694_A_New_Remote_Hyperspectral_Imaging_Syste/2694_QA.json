        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the ability of the RHIS to recognize different types of plastic litter was overall accuracy. The overall accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified image patches of marine litter. The paper states that the obtained results highlighted the plastic litter classification capability with an overall accuracy close to 90%. Therefore, the metric of overall accuracy achieved an accuracy level of approximately 90%."

        "Output": "Yes, based on the overall accuracy close to 90%, the newly presented Remote Hyperspectral Imaging System (RHIS) coupled with the Unmanned Aquatic Drone (UAD) can be considered superior to traditional methods for identifying plastic waste in aquatic environments. The high accuracy suggests that the system is effective in recognizing different types of plastic litter, making it a promising approach for plastic detection and identification in coastal and freshwater environments."
