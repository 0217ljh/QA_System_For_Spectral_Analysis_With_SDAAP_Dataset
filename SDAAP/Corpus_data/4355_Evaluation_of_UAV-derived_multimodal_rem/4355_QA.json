        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of biomass prediction using the UAV-derived data was the coefficient of determination (R2). The predictions using canopy features derived from the multimodal data showed comparable performance with the best results obtained with the single modal data. The coefficients of determination (R2) ranged from 0.40 to 0.53 under water-stressed environment and 0.11 to 0.35 under well-watered environment."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral data derived from the thermal sensor can be used in this research to predict biomass in the context of bioenergy sorghum breeding and drought tolerance assessments.The related study found that the significance in biomass prediction was lowest with the thermal sensor compared to the multispectral and RGB sensors. The coefficients of determination (R2) for biomass prediction using the thermal sensor ranged from 0.11 to 0.35 under well-watered conditions and 0.40 to 0.53 under water-stressed conditions. Therefore, while the thermal sensor can provide some information for biomass prediction, it may not be as effective as the other sensors in this particular context."
