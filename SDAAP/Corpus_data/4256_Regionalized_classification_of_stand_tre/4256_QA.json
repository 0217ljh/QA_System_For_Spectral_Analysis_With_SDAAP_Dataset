        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were utilized to address the challenges of mapping tree species in large mountainous areas by employing a new workflow that combined regionalization, multiple feature fusion, and model fusion. \n\nFirstly, the whole study area, Yunnan province in China, was divided into 8 distinct floristic regions based on the distributions and phylogenetic relationships of native tree species. \n\nThen, multiple data sets, including Sentinel-2 imagery, SRTM DEM, and WorldClim bioclimatic data, were collected and used to construct a high-dimensional feature pool for each region using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. \n\nNext, the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and three classifiers, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to pre-classify the environmental and remote sensing data, respectively. \n\nAfter the pre-classification, two types of decision fusion strategies, parallel and serial ensembles, were applied to fuse the pre-classification probability maps for each sub-region."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The developed machine learning workflow addressed the challenges of tree species abundance, low spectral separability among species, and computing demand in mapping tree species in large mountainous areas through several strategies:\n\n1. Regionalization: The study divided the entire area (Yunnan province in China) into 8 distinct floristic regions based on the distributions and phylogenetic relationships of native tree species. This regionalization approach helped to account for the variability in tree species composition across the landscape.\n\n2. Multiple feature fusion: Multiple data sets, including Sentinel-2 imagery, SRTM DEM, and WorldClim bioclimatic data, were collected and combined to construct a high-dimensional feature pool for each region. By integrating various data sources, the workflow aimed to capture a wide range of information related to tree species distribution.\n\n3. Model fusion: The study employed the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and three classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) to pre-classify environmental and remote sensing data. This model fusion approach allowed for the integration of different algorithms to improve the accuracy of the classification."
