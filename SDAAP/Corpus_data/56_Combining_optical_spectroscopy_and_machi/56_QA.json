        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the algorithm is the false negative rate and the false positive rate. The false negative rate measures the percentage of good nuts that are incorrectly classified as defective, while the false positive rate measures the percentage of defective nuts that are incorrectly classified as good. \n\nThe false negative rate was found to be 5.54%, indicating that 5.54% of the good nuts were incorrectly classified as defective. The maximal false positive rate was found to be 8.34%, indicating that 8.34% of the defective nuts were incorrectly classified as good.\n\nThe performance of the algorithm can be considered excellent as it achieved a correct classification rate exceeding 98% for all other sample defects, including foreign objects and molds."
