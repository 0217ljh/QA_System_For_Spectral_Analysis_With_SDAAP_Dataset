        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the algorithms in the study was accuracy. The study reported different accuracy values for different classifications. The classification of malignant versus benign lesions achieved an accuracy of 88.98%. The classification of grading achieved an accuracy of 83.65%. The classification of the presence of the hormone receptor achieved an accuracy of 81.65%. The study also reported higher accuracy values when using multiple features as predictors, with a maximum test accuracy of 95.83% for classifying malignant versus benign lesions. Therefore, the accuracy metric in this study showed promising results in terms of accurately differentiating breast lesions and predicting histological outcomes and molecular subtypes of tumors."
