        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) in the eastern Mongolian steppe was multispectral imagery of Sentinel-2, encompassing 13 spectral bands in the visible, near-infrared, and short wave infrared regions of the spectrum with 10\u201360 m spatial resolution. This metric can provide detailed and accurate information on vegetation cover and biomass in the study area."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning models were used to estimate fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) in the eastern Mongolian steppe by utilizing spectral bands and vegetation indices extracted from processed Sentinel-2 data as predictors. The field vegetation data, consisting of 256 plots with FVC and AGB measurements, were used as a reference for random forest (RF) models. The RF models were able to derive FVC and AGB from Sentinel-2 imagery, with an R-2 value of 0.81 for FVC and 0.76 for AGB."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral vegetation and soil indices, such as NDVI, Simple Ratio (SR), and OSAVI, can be considered superior to traditional methods for predicting fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) in the eastern Mongolian steppe. The related study states that these predictor variables derived from spectral vegetation and soil indices were highly important for predicting FVC and AGB. Additionally, the random forest (RF) models using these predictor variables achieved high accuracy with R-2 values of 0.81 for FVC and 0.76 for AGB. Therefore, the spectral vegetation and soil indices can be considered superior to traditional methods for estimating FVC and AGB in the study area."
