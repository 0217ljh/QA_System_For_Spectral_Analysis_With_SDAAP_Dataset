        "input": "",
        "Output": "Random Forest classifier was used to model the land cover classes for Liberia and Gabon. Training data was acquired by visually inspecting high spatial resolution imagery from the 2015-2018 period. Each sample consisted of a polygon containing homogenous pixels of a given land cover class, which were used as training inputs for the RF classifier."

        "instruction": "What metric was chosen to produce high-quality land cover maps for Liberia and Gabon, and how far can this metric go?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the land cover products in the related study was overall accuracy. Overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels compared to the total number of pixels in the study area. \n\nWhile overall accuracy is a commonly used metric for assessing the quality of land cover products, it has limitations. It provides a general measure of accuracy but does not provide information on the specific types of errors or the spatial distribution of errors. It also does not account for the potential impact of misclassification on specific applications or decision-making processes. Therefore, while overall accuracy can give an indication of the quality of the land cover products, it may not provide a comprehensive assessment of their suitability for all purposes."

        "instruction": "What was the role of ancillary data in the pixel-based classification method used to produce high-quality land cover maps for Liberia and Gabon?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of ancillary data in the pixel-based classification method used to produce high-quality land cover maps for Liberia and Gabon was to assist in the pre-classification filtering process. The ancillary data, along with the spectral signature, were used to identify and filter out pixels that were prone to be misclassified. This filtering helped to improve the accuracy of the final land cover product by reducing the number of misclassified pixels."

        "instruction": "Can the proposed approach using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform be applied to other countries to produce high-quality land cover maps for natural capital accounting purposes?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed approach using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform can be applied to other countries to produce high-quality land cover maps for natural capital accounting purposes. The approach of pixel-based classification using Landsat 8 data, the Random Forest (RF) classifier, and ancillary data can be replicated in other countries to estimate the multiple services obtained from ecosystems and incorporate the value of nature into national decision making. This approach has been successful in producing high-quality land cover products for Liberia and Gabon, outperforming prior land cover products in both thematic content and accuracy. Therefore, it can be a valuable tool for filling observational gaps in up-to-date land cover data at a national scale in other countries as well."
