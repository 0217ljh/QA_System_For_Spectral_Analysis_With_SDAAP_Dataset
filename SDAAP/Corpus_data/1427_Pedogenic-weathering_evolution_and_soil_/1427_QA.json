        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the sensor fusion approach, combining PXRF and VNIR data, can be used to discriminate and predict pedogenic-weathering proxies in loess-derived soils from different regions of China. The study conducted on 502 soil samples from four loess chronosequences representing different climatic zones of China used a spectral modeling approach with portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) and visible to near-infrared reflectance (VNIR) data. The three-dimensional model developed using principal component analysis (PCA) effectively discriminated soils accumulating under varying climatic conditions. Additionally, predictive models constructed with machine learning methods, including partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and Cubist algorithms, showed that the Cubist algorithm performed better in predicting pedogenic-weathering proxies. The cross-validation results indicated that the sensor fusion approach was superior in terms of accuracy and robustness of results compared to single-sensor models. Therefore, the combination of PXRF and VNIR data can be used to discriminate and predict pedogenic-weathering proxies in loess-derived soils from different regions of China."
