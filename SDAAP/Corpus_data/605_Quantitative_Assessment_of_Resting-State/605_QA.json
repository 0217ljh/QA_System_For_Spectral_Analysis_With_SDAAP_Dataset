        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, spectroscopic methods, specifically resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), can be considered as a feasible approach for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The related study investigated the feasibility of individual MCI detection from healthy controls (HC) using a minimum duration of fNIRS signals. The results showed that there was no significant difference among the various time windows evaluated for MCI detection. This suggests that even a minimum duration of 30 seconds of resting-state fNIRS signals could be used to detect MCI. Therefore, spectroscopic methods, such as fNIRS, can be considered as a viable alternative to traditional methods for MCI detection."
