        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the ranking-based strategy using vegetation indices (VIs) and the Random Forest (RF) machine learning technique can be applied to other crops for yield prediction. The related study specifically focuses on the application of this approach to maize yield prediction. Therefore, it is unclear whether the same approach would be effective for other crops. Further research and experimentation would be necessary to determine the applicability of this strategy to other crops."
