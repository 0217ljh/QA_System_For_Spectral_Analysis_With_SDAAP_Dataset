        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the developed method using Raman hyperspectral imaging system can be considered superior to traditional methods in achieving variety classification of coated maize seeds and assessing variety purity. The study showed that the MCARS-GA-SVM model based on Raman spectral data obtained a calibration accuracy of 99.29% and a prediction accuracy of 100%, which were stable and easily replicated. The accuracy on the independent validation set was 96.88%, demonstrating the practical applicability of the model. Additionally, a simplified model with only 3 variables achieved more than 95% accuracy on each data set. This indicates that the Raman hyperspectral imaging system, combined with the developed models, can provide a real-time detection system with high accuracy for classifying coated seed varieties and assessing variety purity, which is of great significance for increasing crop yield."
