        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed method using FTIR spectroscopy, coupled with chemometrics, can be considered superior to traditional methods for identifying and quantifying artificial sweeteners. The support vector machine model had better predictivity compared to other models, indicating more effective identification performance. Additionally, multivariate calibration models based on partial least squares regression were constructed and validated, showing good agreement with the reference HPLC method for determining sweeteners in beverage samples. This suggests that the FTIR spectroscopy method, combined with chemometrics, is a promising and rapid tool for objectively identifying and quantifying artificial sweeteners."
