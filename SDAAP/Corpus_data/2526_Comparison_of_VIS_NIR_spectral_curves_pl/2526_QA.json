        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the recognition results of VIS/NIR spectral curves plus RGB images can be considered as a cost-effective alternative to hyperspectral images for wood species identification in the related study. The study compared the classification results of Pterocarpus wood species using both hyperspectral images and the combination of VIS/NIR spectral curves and RGB images. The recognition results of the VIS/NIR spectral curves plus RGB images were largely similar to those of hyperspectral images. This suggests that by collecting the spectral information and image information of wood sections separately, the cost of data acquisition can be reduced and the speed of data processing can be improved, while still achieving a similar recognition effect as that of hyperspectral images."
