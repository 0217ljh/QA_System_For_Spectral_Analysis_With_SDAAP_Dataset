        "Output": "Yes, the quantitative inversion model based on the ELM algorithm, using MSC-processed and PCA-dimensioned data, can be considered superior to traditional methods for determining iron grades in skarn-type iron ores based on visible and near-infrared spectral analysis. The research shows that this model has a coefficient of determination (R') of 0.99, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0057, and mean relative error (MRE) of 2.0%. These results indicate that the model has high stability, accuracy, and credibility in predicting iron grades. Compared to traditional methods, which have issues such as high cost, long assay cycle, and lag effect, the quantitative inversion model based on the ELM algorithm provides a real-time and rapid analysis of skarn-type iron ore grade, improving the efficiency of iron ore mining."
