        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of spectral signature data derived from Sentinel-2A satellite images contributed to the enhancement of existing geological maps and mineral resources exploration in the Croatian karst region dominated by carbonate rocks in several ways. \n\nFirstly, the preprocessing and processing of existing analog data (geological maps) in combination with Sentinel-2A satellite images and the United States Geological Survey spectral indices helped to reduce the spatial error of the geometry of geological boundaries. The application of the K-means and random forest algorithm in the digital processing of legacy maps improved the accuracy of the geological boundaries from 100 m and 300 m to below 100 m. This reduction in spatial error allowed for more precise delineation and mapping of the various lithological units in the karst region.\n\nSecondly, the spectral analysis and discriminant function analysis of the Sentinel-2A satellite images enabled the discrimination of individual lithological units. This means that different rock types within the karst region could be identified and differentiated based on their spectral signatures. This information is crucial for evaluating the geological potential for mineral resources, as different lithological units may have varying mineral compositions and economic value."
