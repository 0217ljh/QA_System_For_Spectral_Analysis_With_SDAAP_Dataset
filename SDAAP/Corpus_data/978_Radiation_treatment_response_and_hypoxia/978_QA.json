        "Output": "The GBR-NMF-RF-SHAP model contributes to the identification of radiation response biomarkers and hypoxia indicators in H460 human lung cancer cells and H460 xenografts by combining Raman spectroscopy (RS) with a data analytical framework. This model allows for the monitoring of individual biochemical responses to radiation within the tumour microenvironment.\n\nThe GBR-NMF-RF-SHAP model utilizes group and basis restricted non-negative matrix factorization (GBR-NMF) to analyze the biochemical responses observed with RS. It also incorporates a random forest (RF) classifier and a feature metric importance calculation method called Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).\n\nBy applying this model, a wide range of radiation response biomarkers and hypoxia indicators, such as glycogen, lipids, DNA, and amino acids, were identified in H460 human lung cancer cells and H460 xenografts. The model also revealed correlations between hypoxic regions and specific Raman chemical biomarkers like glycogen, alanine, and arginine in H460 xenografts.\n\nIn summary, the GBR-NMF-RF-SHAP model combined with RS provides a comprehensive approach to understanding the individual biochemical dynamics in radiation response."
