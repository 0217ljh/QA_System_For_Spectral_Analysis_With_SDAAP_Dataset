        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of the 2D CNN model in the past study on the identification of rock samples using LIBS was compared to other identification methods, including 1D CNN, kNN, PCA-kNN, SVM, PCA-SVM, PLS-DA, and Human-Assisted ANN (HA-ANN). The results indicated that the 2D CNN model had the highest accuracy among all the methods. The validation set of the 2D CNN achieved an accuracy of 0.9877, while the test set reached an accuracy of 1, indicating perfect classification. This suggests that the 2D CNN model outperformed the other methods in accurately identifying the different types of rocks based on their spectroscopic data."
