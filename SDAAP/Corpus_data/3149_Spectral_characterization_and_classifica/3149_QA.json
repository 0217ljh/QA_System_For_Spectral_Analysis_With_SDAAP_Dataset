        "Output": "Classification accuracy was chosen as the metric to evaluate the early identification and classification of crown root rot and vascular wilt diseases caused by FORL and F.S. The classification accuracy achieved as early as 3 days after inoculation (DAI) was the maximum in this study."

        "Output": "Yes, the related study found that certain spectral bands can effectively distinguish healthy and diseased tomato plants at different disease stages. The spectral bands 508, 711, 540, 717, 536, 644 nm were found to be the most effective in distinguishing Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis lycopersici (FORL)-infected plants from healthy plants, while the spectral bands 705, 1883, 525, 518, 444, 522 nm were the most effective in distinguishing Fusarium solani (F.S.)-infected plants from healthy plants. These findings suggest that hyperspectral reflectance can be used as an alternative approach for the early identification and classification of crown root rot and vascular wilt diseases in tomato plants."
