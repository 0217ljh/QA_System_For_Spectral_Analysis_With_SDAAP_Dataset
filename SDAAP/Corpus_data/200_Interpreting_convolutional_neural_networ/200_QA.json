The CNN model was trained to classify VOCs with an accuracy of 99.9%. This indicates that the CNN approach is highly effective in accurately identifying and classifying different types of VOCs.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, the study mentions the development of a microplasma-generation platform that efficiently collected 64 k spectra from various types of VOCs at different concentrations. This platform was used as the training and testing sets for the CNN model. Additionally, the CNN model was able to identify and report the type of VOCs within 10 seconds once the microplasma was ignited. This suggests that the CNN approach is efficient in providing real-time VOC monitoring.\n\nIn comparison to traditional methods, the use of CNN for VOC classification offers several advantages. Traditional methods may rely on manual analysis or less advanced machine learning techniques, which may not achieve the same level of accuracy as the CNN model. Additionally, the real-time capabilities of the CNN model provide a faster and more efficient approach compared to traditional methods.\n\nOverall, the use of interpretable CNN for real-time VOC classification using optical emission spectroscopy"
