        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the Deep Learning approaches is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2 value). These metrics are used to assess the accuracy and precision of the predictions made by the Deep Learning models.\n\nThe text does not specify how far these metrics can go in terms of their range or limitations. However, it does mention that the average RMSE on the prediction is very low, with values as low as 0.02 wt% for certain elements. This suggests that the Deep Learning models have shown promising results in terms of accurately predicting the alloying element concentrations in the post-consumer scrap pieces."

        "Output": "The performance of Deep Learning approaches in estimating alloying element concentrations in post-consumer aluminium scrap using quantitative Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) analysis is compared to traditional univariate regression and Machine Learning methods in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2 value. The study found that the Deep Learning approaches outperformed the traditional methods in terms of these performance metrics. The average RMSE on the prediction was just 0.02 wt% for Al and Si, and not more than 0.01 wt% for Fe, Cu, Mn, Mg, and Zn. This indicates that the best-performing Deep Learning model shows promise for the future of LIBS in metal sorting applications."
