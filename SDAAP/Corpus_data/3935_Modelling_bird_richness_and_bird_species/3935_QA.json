        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study assessed the usefulness of airborne laser-scanning (ALS) and multispectral aerial images in predicting species richness and single-species presence of birds by developing prediction models using two different approaches: generalized linear models and the machine learning method random forest. The predictor variables used in these models were descriptors of three-dimensional forest structure obtained from ALS and descriptors of tree species composition obtained from multispectral aerial images. The models were then cross-validated to evaluate their predictive capability. The study found that ALS variables enabled slight or fair predictions of bird presence, and including multispectral data slightly improved the predictions, particularly for the Willow Warbler species. The conclusion of the study suggests that better matching the scale of recording for birds and the predictor variables obtained by remote sensing can further improve the predictability of species richness and single-species presence."
