These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's prediction ability, accuracy, and precision.\n\nThe R-T measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted and actual values. A value of 1 indicates a perfect correlation, while a value of 0 indicates no correlation.\n\nThe RMSET quantifies the average difference between the predicted and actual values, providing an indication of the model's accuracy. A lower RMSET value indicates better accuracy.\n\nThe RSDT measures the variability of the predicted values around the mean, indicating the precision of the model. A lower RSDT value indicates higher precision.\n\nThese metrics together provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in predicting the content of berberine in Coptidis Rhizoma samples using FT-NIR spectral analysis."
