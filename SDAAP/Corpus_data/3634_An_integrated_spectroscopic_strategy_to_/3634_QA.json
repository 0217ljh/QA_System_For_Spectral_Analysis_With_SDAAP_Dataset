        "input": "",
        "Output": "The related study states that a rapid and effective geographical traceability system for emblic medicines has not been designed yet. However, the proposed integrated spectroscopic strategy, which includes spectral pretreatment, outlier diagnosis, feature selection, data fusion, and machine learning algorithm, aims to address this issue. The results of the study demonstrate that this strategy is effective and can be generalized, achieving a rapid, nondestructive, and green quality detection for emblic medicines originating from seventeen geographical origins. Therefore, compared to traditional methods, the proposed integrated spectroscopic strategy offers a more efficient and effective approach to geographical traceability for emblic medicines."
