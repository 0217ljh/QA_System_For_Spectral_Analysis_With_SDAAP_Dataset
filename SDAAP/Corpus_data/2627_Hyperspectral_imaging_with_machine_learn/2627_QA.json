        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data can be considered a superior and non-destructive method for distinguishing Astragalus seeds from similar seeds, as compared to traditional methods. The related study states that current methods for distinguishing Astragalus seeds from similar seeds are time-consuming, laborious, and destructive. In contrast, HSI allows for the collection of morphological and spectral data of each seed batch without destroying the seeds. \n\nThe text also mentions that machine vision and HSI were used to collect data and establish discriminant models through various algorithms. The results showed that support vector machine (SVM) modeling of machine vision data could distinguish Astragalus seeds from similar seeds with over 99% accuracy. Additionally, the FD-UVE-SVM model based on hyperspectral data reached 100% accuracy in the validation set and maintained stability in further testing.\n\nTherefore, HSI data can be considered a superior and non-destructive method for distinguishing Astragalus seeds from similar seeds, addressing challenges in the cultivation of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus (AMM), and preventing adulteration of commercial seeds."
