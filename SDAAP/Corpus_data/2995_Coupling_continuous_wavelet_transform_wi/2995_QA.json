        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in the study on improving the performance of wavelet analysis in winter wheat water status monitoring was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, with a lower value indicating a better fit of the model.\n\nThe study reported that the best prediction of canopy water content, plant water content, and canopy equivalent water thickness was achieved by the random forest (RF) model with an R-2 value of 0.92 and an RMSE of 2.39%, the support vector machine (SVM) model with an R-2 value of 0.93 and an RMSE of 2.12%, and the SVM model with an R-2 value of 0.79 and an RMSE of 99.31 \u6e2dm, respectively. The wavelet index model also showed a good monitoring ability with R-2 values ranging from 0.71 to 0.82."

The study utilized machine learning algorithms such as multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) in combination with wavelet analysis to construct prediction models for winter wheat water status. These models, particularly those based on multiple sensitive wavelet features, showed improved performance in predicting canopy water content, plant water content, and canopy equivalent water thickness compared to traditional methods. The machine learning models were able to avoid collinearity between features, make full use of spectral information, and enhance the monitoring ability of wavelet transform for winter wheat water status. Therefore, the findings suggest that the use of machine learning algorithms combined with wavelet analysis and spectral information can indeed improve the monitoring of winter wheat water status compared to traditional methods."
