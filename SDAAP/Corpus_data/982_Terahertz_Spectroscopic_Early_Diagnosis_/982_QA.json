Based on the information provided in the related study, the combination of terahertz spectroscopic detection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum with machine learning algorithms can be considered a superior method for the early diagnosis of cerebral ischemia compared to traditional methods. The study conducted spectroscopy on CSF and serum samples from rats with different ischemic times and analyzed the changes in absorption coefficient and refractive index. The results showed that the absorption coefficient of CSF and serum varied with different ischemic times. By using machine learning algorithms, specifically the support vector machine classification model, the researchers were able to automatically classify and recognize the degree of cerebral ischemia with a recognition accuracy of 89.3%. This suggests that the combination of terahertz spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms provides a new and effective detection method for the early diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, which could potentially be superior to traditional methods."
