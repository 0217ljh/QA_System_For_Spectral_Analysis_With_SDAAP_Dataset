        "Output": "The spatial correlation of the data predicted by spectroscopy models was found to be similar to the data obtained through traditional chemical analyses in the study evaluating clay and soil organic matter (SOM) data. The clay and SOM maps produced using the spectroscopy predictions showed similarities and feasible accuracy for the use and management of agricultural soils in vineyard areas."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of data predicted by spectroscopy models is comparable to the accuracy of data obtained through traditional chemical analyses in predicting clay and soil organic matter (SOM) data. The study found that the RF + SGD model had a cross-validation performance of R(2)cv = 0.95 and RMSEcv = 1.06% for clay prediction, while the PLSR + SGD model had a cross-validation performance of R(2)cv = 0.98 and RMSEcv = 0.07% for SOM prediction. These values indicate a high level of accuracy in predicting both clay and SOM using spectroscopy models. The data predicted by Vis-NIR-SWIR spectroscopy preserved the spatial structure of the data obtained by traditional wet chemical analysis, further supporting the accuracy of the spectroscopy models in predicting clay and SOM data."
