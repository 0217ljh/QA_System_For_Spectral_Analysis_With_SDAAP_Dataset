        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the research investigating the feasibility of predicting the results of the USEPA 3051a method for 28 chemical elements from pXRF data is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). These metrics were used to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by different regression models and machine learning algorithms. The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the predicted values that can be explained by the model, while the RPD value provides a measure of the precision of the predictions relative to the standard deviation of the reference method. These metrics help evaluate the effectiveness of the pXRF data in predicting the results of the USEPA 3051a method and provide insights into the potential of using proximal sensors as an alternative to laboratory analyses."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The results of the study suggest that pXRF data can be used as an alternative to the USEPA 3051a method for large-scale routine geochemical characterization of tropical soils. The study found that linear regressions and machine learning algorithms using pXRF data were able to accurately predict the results of the USEPA 3051a method for 28 chemical elements. The machine learning algorithms, specifically support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), performed better than the linear regressions. The R-2 and RPD values ranged from 0.52 to 0.94 and 1.43 to 3.62, respectively, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted values and the actual USEPA 3051a results. Additionally, the lowest values of RMSE and NRMSE values (0.28 to 0.70 mg kg(-1)) further support the accuracy of the predictions. This suggests that pXRF data can provide a cost-effective, time-saving, and environmentally friendly alternative to laboratory analyses for large-scale routine geochemical characterization of tropical soils."
