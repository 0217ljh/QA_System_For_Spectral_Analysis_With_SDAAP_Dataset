        "input": "",
        "Output": "The extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm was used to develop a categorization model for predicting the growth process of yeast in industrial fermentation. The ELM algorithm was employed after selecting characteristic wavelength variables of near infrared (NIR) data using the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method. The ELM algorithm was trained using the selected NIR data and their corresponding optical density (OD) values, which were determined using the photoelectric turbidity method. The trained ELM model was then used to predict the growth phases of yeast based on the NIR spectral data. The experimental results showed that the ELM model achieved a prediction accuracy of 98.68% for the training set and 97.37% for the testing set, indicating the effectiveness of the ELM algorithm in predicting the growth process of yeast in industrial fermentation."
