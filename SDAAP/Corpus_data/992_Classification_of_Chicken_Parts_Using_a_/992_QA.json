        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of portable NIR equipment and ML algorithms can be considered a superior method for classifying chicken parts compared to traditional methods. Traditional methods, such as physical-chemical analysis, have disadvantages such as time constraints and the requirement of chemicals. In contrast, the use of portable NIR equipment combined with ML algorithms offers a rapid, noninvasive, and precise characterization of biological samples. In the related study, the combination of portable NIR equipment and ML algorithms achieved a classification accuracy of 98.8% for differentiating breast samples from thighs and drumstick. This demonstrates the potential of this approach for accurate classification of chicken parts in the processing industry."
