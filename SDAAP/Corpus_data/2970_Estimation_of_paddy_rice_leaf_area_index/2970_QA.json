        "Output": "The machine learning methods (support vector regression, random forests, and artificial neural network) were found to be more accurate and robust compared to the traditional regression models (narrowband NDVI with optimized band combinations and linear multivariate calibration partial least squares regression) for estimating the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of paddy rice. \n\nWhen validating the calibrated models against the standalone validation dataset, the machine learning methods yielded lower validation RMSE values (0.82 for support vector machine, 0.67 for artificial neural network, and 0.84 for random forests) compared to the traditional regression models (1.17 for NDVI(766,830) and 1.01 for NDVI(1114,1190) for narrowband NDVI).\n\nAdditionally, the models built on the first derivative spectra, using the machine learning methods, were found to be more accurate than the models built on the raw spectra. The combination of the red edge and NIR bands (766 nm and 830 nm) as well as the combination of SWIR bands (1114 nm and 1190 nm) were identified as optimal for producing the narrowband NDVI."
