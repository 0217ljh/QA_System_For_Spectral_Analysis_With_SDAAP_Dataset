        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the calibration model for the rapid and non-destructive prediction of egg storage time is the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The R-squared value indicates how well the model fits the data and explains the variability of the dependent variable (egg storage time) based on the independent variables (spectral data). In this case, the calibration model achieved an R-squared value of 0.8319 +/- 0.0377, which means that approximately 83.19% of the variability in egg storage time can be explained by the model."

        "Output": "Yes, the spectral acquisition method used in the related study can be considered a superior alternative to traditional methods for predicting egg storage time using low-cost devices. The study presents a novel approach that utilizes a low-cost near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectrometer connected to a smartphone. This method is non-destructive and rapid, allowing for the prediction of egg storage time at room temperature. The results of the study show that the technique achieved a coefficient of determination (R-squared) of 0.8319 +/- 0.0377 and a root mean squared error in cross-validation test set (RMSECV) of 1.97 days, indicating its accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, the use of low-cost devices makes this method more accessible and cost-effective compared to expensive laboratory equipment used in traditional methods. Therefore, the spectral acquisition method presented in this study offers a superior alternative for predicting egg storage time using low-cost devices."
