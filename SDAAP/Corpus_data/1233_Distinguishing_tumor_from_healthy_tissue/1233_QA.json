        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, according to the provided text, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using an extended wavelength range (450-1550 nm) offers advantages over using the conventional wavelength range in distinguishing malignant liver tissues from surrounding tissues. The study found that tumors were distinguished from surrounding liver tissues with a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 100%, classification rate of 100%, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 100% using the extended wavelength range and a combination of principal component analysis and support vector techniques. This suggests that the extended wavelength range provides more accurate and reliable results in differentiating between malignant liver tissues and surrounding tissues."
