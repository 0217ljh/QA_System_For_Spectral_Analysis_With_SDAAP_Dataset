        "instruction": "How does the LASSO algorithm effectively solve the spectral multicollinearity problem and reduce the number and calculation complexity of soil hyperspectral variables in estimating soil petroleum hydrocarbon content?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The LASSO algorithm effectively solves the spectral multicollinearity problem by introducing a penalty term that encourages sparsity in the regression model. This penalty term, known as the L1 norm, shrinks the coefficients of correlated variables towards zero, effectively selecting a subset of variables that are most relevant for predicting the target variable.\n\nBy reducing the coefficients of correlated variables to zero, the LASSO algorithm automatically selects a subset of variables that have the strongest relationship with the soil petroleum hydrocarbon content. This helps in reducing the number of variables used in the estimation model, thereby reducing the calculation complexity.\n\nAdditionally, the LASSO algorithm also performs feature selection, which means it can identify and exclude irrelevant variables from the model. This further reduces the number of variables and simplifies the calculation process, leading to improved estimation accuracy.\n\nOverall, the LASSO algorithm effectively addresses the spectral multicollinearity problem by promoting sparsity in the regression model, resulting in a reduced number of variables and calculation complexity in estimating soil petroleum hydrocarbon content."
