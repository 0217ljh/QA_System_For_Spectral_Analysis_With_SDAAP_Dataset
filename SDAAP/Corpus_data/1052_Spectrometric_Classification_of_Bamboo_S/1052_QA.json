        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the classification models was overall accuracy. The best performing model, the SVM model combined with the Det+2nd derivative, achieved an overall accuracy of 0.95. Additionally, using less than 16% of the full-length NIR spectra still resulted in a high accuracy of 0.91."
