        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric used in the analysis of sera samples for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma were sensitivity and specificity.The best model achieved a sensitivity of 80-100% and a specificity between 83 and 100% for CCA, depending on the spectral window used to model the spectra. Sensitivity and specificity are commonly used metrics in diagnostic performance evaluation. Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positive results, while specificity measures the proportion of true negative results."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and spectral modeling show promise as a diagnostic tool for cholangiocarcinoma. The past study demonstrates that ATR-FTIR can discriminate cholangiocarcinoma sera from healthy donors, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and biliary disease (BD) using multivariate analysis. Spectral markers specific to cholangiocarcinoma were identified, and principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed discrimination between cholangiocarcinoma and healthy sera. However, it was not possible to separate cholangiocarcinoma from HCC and BD using these methods.\n\nThe study also established spectral modeling using various machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and neural network (NN). The neural network model achieved a sensitivity of 80-100% and a specificity between 83 and 100% for cholangiocarcinoma, depending on the spectral window used.\n\nBased on these findings, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and spectral modeling can be considered a potentially superior diagnostic method for cholangiocarcinoma compared to traditional methods.
