        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of UAV-borne hyperspectral data for estimating grassland biomass has several advantages compared to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and spatial analysis. \n\nFirstly, the traditional methods for estimating grassland biomass are labor-intensive and prone to error due to small sample size. In contrast, the use of UAV-borne hyperspectral data provides high spatial resolution and coverage, allowing for a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of grassland biomass. This means that the estimation of grassland biomass using UAV-borne hyperspectral data is less prone to errors and provides more reliable results.\n\nSecondly, the study utilized four machine learning algorithms to model grassland biomass using UAV-borne hyperspectral data. Among these algorithms, the rule-based ML method Cubist regression (CBR) performed the best, delivering high prediction accuracies for both fresh matter yield (FMY) and dry matter yield (DMY). The study reported prediction accuracies of 7.6% nRMSE(p) and 0.87 R-p(2) for FMY, and 12.9% nRMSE(p) and 0.75 R-p(2) for DMY."
