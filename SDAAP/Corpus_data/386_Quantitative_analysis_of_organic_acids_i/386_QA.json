        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the model's performance in the analysis of OA concentrations in pomelo fruit samples was the root mean square error (RMSE). The model training results showed that the RMSE was 0.834 g/kg, indicating the average difference between the predicted and actual OA concentrations in the pomelo fruit samples. This suggests that the model had a relatively low error in its predictions. Additionally, the correlation coefficient was reported as 0.936, indicating a strong positive correlation between the predicted and actual OA concentrations. Overall, the model performed well in the analysis of OA concentrations in pomelo fruit samples."

        "Output": "Yes, the past study suggests that the proposed automatically training of the network architectural kernel can be used to improve the PLS modeling effects for the FT-NIR rapid analysis of OA in pomelo fruit. The model calibration results showed that the optimal network structure with 130 hidden nodes and 20 output nodes, along with the optimal kernel, improved the PLS model. The model training results demonstrated a root mean square error of 0.834 g/kg and a correlation coefficient of 0.936. Additionally, the model prediction results indicated that the proposed training method is feasible for improving the PLS modeling effects in the analysis of OA in pomelo fruit using FT-NIR spectroscopy."
