        "input": "",
        "Output": "The optimal variables for modeling in the related study on estimating leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) using UAV imagery were determined through a two-step process. \n\nFirst, Pearson correlation filtering was applied to identify the hyperspectral variables (H-variables) that had a significant correlation with LCC. This step helped to narrow down the pool of potential inputs for the models.\n\nSecond, a recursive feature elimination procedure was conducted. This procedure involved systematically removing less important variables from the pool of H-variables and evaluating the performance of the models at each step. The goal was to find the subset of variables that resulted in the highest accuracy for LCC estimation.\n\nBy combining these two steps, the study identified the optimal H-variables that were most relevant for modeling LCC estimation using UAV imagery."
