        "input": "",
        "Output": "The spectral predictors were used in the Random Forest (RF) models to predict above-ground biomass (AGB) in potato plants by applying three types of spectral predictors: the full spectrum, published spectral indices (Pub-SIs), and optimized spectral indices (Opt-SIs). The full spectrum refers to the complete set of spectral bands obtained from the canopy hyperspectral reflectance of potato plants. The Pub-SIs were selected from twelve published spectral indices, and their spectral bands were optimized using band optimization algorithms. The Opt-SIs, which were found to be the best input variables for the RF models, were obtained by optimizing the spectral bands of the Pub-SIs. By using these spectral predictors as input variables in the RF models, the prediction accuracy for potato AGB was greatly enhanced, with improvements in R-2 values ranging from 6% to 16% across different growth stages. Additionally, the Opt-SIs were able to significantly reduce the number of input variables, reducing collinearity and redundancies in the spectral data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The optimized spectral indices (Opt-SIs) combined with Random Forest (RF) models improved the prediction accuracy of above-ground biomass (AGB) in potato plants compared to traditional empirical models in several ways. \n\nFirstly, the Opt-SIs were found to be the best input variables for the RF models, indicating that they provided more informative and relevant spectral information for estimating AGB. This suggests that the Opt-SIs were able to capture the variations in AGB more effectively than traditional empirical models.\n\nSecondly, the RF models based on Opt-SIs outperformed the best empirical model based on Opt-SIs. The RF models showed an increase in the coefficient of determination (R-2) by 6%, 10%, and 16% at the tuber formation, tuber bulking, and across the two growth stages, respectively. This indicates that the RF models using Opt-SIs were able to better explain the variations in AGB compared to traditional empirical models.\n\nFurthermore, the Opt-SIs significantly reduced the number of input variables required for the RF models. This reduction in input variables helps to reduce collinearity and redundancies in the spectral data, leading to more accurate predictions of AGB."
