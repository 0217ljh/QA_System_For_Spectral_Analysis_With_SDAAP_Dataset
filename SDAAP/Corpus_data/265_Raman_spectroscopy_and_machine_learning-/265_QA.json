        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the developed probe using the optical sensor based on sputum samples can be considered superior to traditional diagnostic methods for the detection of tuberculosis (TB) in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The past study states that the probe's accuracy is 100% for true-positive and 93.4% for true-negative when tested on 112 potential TB patients. This indicates that the probe has a high level of accuracy in correctly identifying both TB-positive and TB-negative patients. Additionally, the probe is described as quick, portable, easy-to-use, and non-invasive, which suggests that it is efficient and convenient compared to standard TB diagnostic tests that take days to weeks to produce results. Therefore, the developed probe offers a viable and rapid TB diagnostic platform, making it superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency."
