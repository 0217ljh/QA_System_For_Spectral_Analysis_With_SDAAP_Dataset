        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the model performance in the study on radiomics-based differentiation of GBM and IMD was the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). This metric measures the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate for different classification thresholds. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to quantify the performance of the models.\n\nThe AUC ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 0.5 indicating a random classifier and a value of 1 indicating a perfect classifier. In this study, the AUC values ranged from 0.951 to 0.953, indicating that the models had high discriminatory power in differentiating between GBM and IMD. The closer the AUC value is to 1, the better the model's performance in correctly classifying the two types of brain tumors. Therefore, the chosen metric of AUC can provide valuable information about the effectiveness of the models in this study."
