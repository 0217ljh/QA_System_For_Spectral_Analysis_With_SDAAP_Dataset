        "Output": "The metric chosen in this research work is the Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel based Modified Possibilisticc-Means (MPCM) algorithms. These algorithms were used to identify paddy stubble burnt fields in a test site in Patiala, Punjab, India. The effectiveness of these machine learning approaches was tested for the identification of burnt fields and to determine the better classifier between ED and Gaussian Kernel MPCM.\n\nThe metric of Euclidean Distance measures the straight-line distance between two points in a multidimensional space. It is used to calculate the similarity or dissimilarity between different data points.\n\nThe Gaussian Kernel is a non-linear function that calculates the similarity between data points based on their distance. It assigns higher weights to nearby points and lower weights to distant points.\n\nThe metric of Euclidean Distance and Gaussian Kernel MPCM classifiers were used to analyze the Sentinel 2A/2B cloud-free temporal data and generate Class Based Sensor Independent Indices (CBSII) database. The burning of paddy stubble was observed from the last week of October to the first week of November, and the variation of CBSII-NDVI temporal plot was used to visualize the burnt fields."
