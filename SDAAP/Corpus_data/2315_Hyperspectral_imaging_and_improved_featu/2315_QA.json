        "Output": "The metric chosen to develop a rapid and non-destructive protocol for assaying deoxynivalenol (DON) in barley kernels is the coefficient of determination in prediction (R-P(2)). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (DON content in barley kernels) that can be explained by the independent variables (hyperspectral imaging data). \n\nThe R-P(2) value obtained in the related study was 0.728, indicating that approximately 72.8% of the variance in DON content can be explained by the hyperspectral imaging data."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the findings of the related study, hyperspectral imaging can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for non-destructive DON assays of barley samples. The study showed that hyperspectral imaging, specifically using full-wavelength locally weighted partial least squares regression (LWPLSR), achieved high accuracy in predicting DON levels in barley kernels. The coefficient of determination in prediction (R-P(2)) was 0.728, and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 3.802. \n\nFurthermore, the study also used competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and the iterative selection of successive projections algorithm (ISSPA) to optimize the selected feature wavelengths. The model developed using 7 feature variables yielded a R-P(2) of 0.680 and an RMSEP of 4.213 in DON content prediction. \n\nAdditionally, partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was able to discriminate barley kernels with different levels of DON based on the selected wavelengths, with a high Matthews correlation coefficient in cross-validation (M-RCV) of 0.931."
