        "Output": "Near-infrared spectroscopy is used in determining the composition and content of magnesite by analyzing the absorption degrees of different types of H group in magnesite to near-infrared spectroscopy. This spectroscopic technique is simple, fast, accurate, and efficient without destroying the sample. By collecting magnesite NIR data samples and using principal component analysis (PCA) for data dimensionality reduction, the main element contribution rate is obtained. This process helps in identifying characteristic variables that can be used for quantitative analysis. The near-infrared spectroscopy, combined with the ELM magnesite grade classification model, allows for rapid classification of magnesite grade."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed combination of near-infrared spectroscopy and the ELM magnesite grade classification model contributes to achieving rapid classification of magnesite grade in several ways. \n\nFirstly, near-infrared spectroscopy is used to determine the composition and content of magnesite. Different types of H group in magnesite have different absorption degrees to near-infrared spectroscopy, allowing for the differentiation of magnesite grades. This spectroscopy technique is simple, fast, accurate, and efficient without destroying the sample.\n\nSecondly, the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) algorithm is utilized to establish a mathematical model for quantitative analysis. This model takes into account the magnesite NIR data samples and uses principal component analysis (PCA) for data dimensionality reduction. By selecting the most significant characteristic variables, the ELM algorithm can effectively classify magnesite grades.\n\nFurthermore, the ELM algorithm model is trained using a set of samples and tested using another set of samples. The model's hidden layer nodes are selected to optimize the classification performance. This approach ensures that the ELM model can accurately classify magnesite grades."
