This joint use of ANN and SAM demonstrated a 1.2% to 21% improvement in classification accuracy compared to the training sample size.\n\nHowever, the study also found that the performance of the proposed method was dependent on the amount of learning data available. In cases where few training data were available, the proposed approach using ANN and SAM was quite robust and showed good performance. On the other hand, the SAE and standard ANN algorithms were more successful in cases where more learning data were present.\n\nTherefore, the proposed age-based pavement assessment method using hyperspectral images and the integrated algorithm with ANN and SAM showed promising results and improved classification accuracy compared to other algorithms such as SVM and SAE, especially when limited training data were available."

This joint use results in a 1.2% to 21% improvement in classification accuracy compared to the training sample size. \n\nThe study also mentions that the proposed approach is quite robust in cases where few training data are available. This suggests that the ANN and SAM algorithm combination is effective even when there is limited data for training. \n\nOn the other hand, the study notes that SAE and standard ANN algorithms are more successful when there is more learning data available. This implies that these algorithms may perform better in cases with a larger amount of training data. \n\nOverall, the joint use of ANN and SAM in the proposed method shows promising results for age-based pavement assessment using hyperspectral images, particularly in cases with limited training data."
