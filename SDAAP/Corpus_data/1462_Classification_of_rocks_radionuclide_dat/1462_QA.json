        "Output": "The purpose of assessing the performance of different classification methods in classifying radionuclide data obtained from three different types of rocks is to determine which method is most effective in accurately categorizing the rocks into their respective types (metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous) based on the radionuclide data. This assessment helps in understanding the reliability and accuracy of each classification method and allows for the selection of the most suitable method for future classification tasks involving similar data."
