        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of FTIR spectroscopy combined with statistical multivariate analysis can be considered superior to traditional methods in identifying high explosive materials in residue samples after explosions. This is because FTIR spectroscopy provides high sensitivity and selectivity in the detection of samples, allowing for accurate identification of specific materials. Additionally, the use of statistical multivariate analysis enhances the analysis process by considering multiple variables simultaneously, leading to more reliable and precise results. The related study demonstrates the successful application of this approach in identifying high explosive materials such as C-4, TNT, and PETN in residue samples after both high- and low-order explosions. The best results were achieved using the hybrid LDA-PCA technique, which further highlights the effectiveness of this method in forensic science."
