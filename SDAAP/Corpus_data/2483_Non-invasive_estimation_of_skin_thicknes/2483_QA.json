        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the skin thickness estimation was the mean absolute error. The results showed that the mean absolute errors were on the order of the Ultrasound resolution, which was the gold standard. This suggests that the hyperspectral-based method for estimating skin thickness was close to the gold standard and accurate in clinical settings."

        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral-based methods can accurately estimate skin thickness in clinical settings. The related study states that the researchers developed a method that combined a physics-based model of human skin with machine learning and hyperspectral imaging to estimate physiological skin parameters, including skin thickness. They also developed a protocol to test their methodology using ultrasound to acquire a gold standard dataset for skin thickness estimation. The results of their study showed mean absolute errors on the order of the ultrasound resolution, indicating that the hyperspectral-based method was able to accurately estimate skin thickness."
