The results showed that the efficiency of ELM is mainly affected by the number of nodes for a certain dataset. Despite some instability, ELM becomes stable close to the optimal parameters. \n\nIn terms of predictive performance, ELM was found to have a better or comparable performance compared to its competitors. This indicates that ELM is a viable and effective algorithm for the spectral quantitative analysis of complex samples. \n\nOverall, the ELM algorithm combines the advantages of both linear and non-linear methods, providing a more efficient and stable approach for analyzing complex samples compared to traditional methods."
