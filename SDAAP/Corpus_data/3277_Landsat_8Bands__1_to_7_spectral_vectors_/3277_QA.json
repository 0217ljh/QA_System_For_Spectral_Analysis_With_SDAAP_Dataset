        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed spectral vector-based methodology using Landsat 8 bands is found to be more effective in improving the classification of urban land features compared to traditional methods. Traditional methods typically rely on analyzing multispectral (MS) images directly, whereas the proposed methodology explores the visible wavelengths from deep-blue to shortwave infrared using spectral vectors.\n\nBy using two different ratio models and combining two and three bands in the cloud environment of Google Earth Engine, the methodology introduces new entries for land use land cover (LULC) classification. This approach allows for the detection and discrimination of LULC features, as well as an accurate extraction of human settlements.\n\nThe methodology also involves building arrays of derivative bands and new pixels' values, which are then subjected to a decision tree analysis to select the most suitable derivative bands for further analysis. These selected bands are stacked and submitted to five machine learning classifiers, including Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GBR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Minimum Distance (MD)."
