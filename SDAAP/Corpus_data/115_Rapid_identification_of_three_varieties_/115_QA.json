        "Output": "In the study on the rapid and non-invasive identification of Chrysanthemum varieties using machine learning and near-infrared spectroscopy, machine learning models were utilized through partial least squares analysis. The near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra of Chrysanthemum varieties were preprocessed using a first-order derivative (D1) and autoscaling. A model was then built using partial least squares analysis, which is a machine learning technique. This model was used to conduct qualitative analysis and identify three Chrysanthemum varieties. The accuracy rates of the model were evaluated in both the calibration set and the prediction set."
