        "Output": "Yes, near-infrared spectral images and machine learning approaches can effectively quantify different levels of physical perturbation on mushroom pilei in the research on assessing mechanical damage in mushrooms. The text states that an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier is implemented, using near-infrared spectral images as input, to classify the different levels of mechanical vibration. The use of machine learning techniques, specifically ANNs, has shown to perform better for this specific application compared to support vector machines. The frame-based classification approach, which utilizes interest points instead of exhaustive search, has also been shown to increase classification accuracy. Overall, the combination of near-infrared spectral images and machine learning approaches has proven to be effective in quantifying physical perturbation on mushroom pilei."
