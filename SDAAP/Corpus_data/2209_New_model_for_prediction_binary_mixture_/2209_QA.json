These statistical parameters were used to assess the accuracy and precision of the models in predicting the antihistamine decongestant contents. \n\nThe metric can go a long way in selecting the best model for determining antihistamine decongestant contents. By comparing the values of MSE, R2, r, mean recovery (%), and RSD for each method, it is possible to identify the model that provides the most accurate and precise predictions. Additionally, the comparison of these metrics with the reference method, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), further validates the performance of the proposed methods. The absence of significant differences between the suggested methods and the reference method, as determined by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, indicates that the chosen metrics are effective in selecting the best model."

The study found that the proposed intelligent methods, ANNs and LS-SVM, showed promising results in predicting the antihistamine decongestant contents. \n\nIn the first step, the feed-forward back-propagation network with two different training algorithms, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back-propagation (GDX), were employed. The performance of the LM algorithm was found to be better than the GDX algorithm.\n\nIn the second step, the radial basis network was utilized and its results were compared with the previous network. \n\nLastly, the LS-SVM method was proposed as another intelligent method to construct the antihistamine decongestant prediction model. The results of the LS-SVM method were compared with the two aforementioned networks.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of these methods, statistical parameters such as mean square error (MSE), regression coefficient (R2), correlation coefficient (r), mean recovery (%), and"
