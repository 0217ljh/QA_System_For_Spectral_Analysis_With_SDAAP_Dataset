        "Output": "The metric used in the rapid and nondestructive recognition method of tire rubber was classification accuracy. The recognition accuracy was used to assess the performance of the models. The recognition accuracy is a commonly used metric in classification tasks, which measures the percentage of correctly classified samples. In this case, the recognition accuracy was reported to be 100% for all samples based on the tire type, with a training set value of 96.9% and a test set value of 92.3%. "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers optimized the parameters of the machine learning models by adjusting various factors that affect the recognition performance. These factors include the k value for weighted k nearest neighbor analysis (WKNN), the kernel function for support vector machine (SVM), the number of estimators for random forest (RF), and other parameters such as maximum depth and minimum sample leaf. The researchers compared the performance of the models using different parameter settings and determined the optimal combination. In this case, the results showed that the SVM model with a polynomial kernel function, C = 20, and gamma = 1 was considered to be the best performing model."

The recognition performance of the four models used in the related study, namely SVM, LR, WKNN, and RF, was evaluated and compared. The results indicate that the SVM model with a polynomial kernel function, C = 20, and gamma = 1 was considered optimal, achieving a recognition accuracy of 100% for all tire samples.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, the method is described as rapid and nondestructive, suggesting that it provides a quick and efficient way to recognize tire rubber.
