The RMSE value obtained for the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was 0.059. \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the research states that the proposed convolutional neural networks for multi-regression (CNN-MR) achieved a further improvement compared to the benchmark PLSR method, with an RMSE of 0.035.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were utilized in the research on the development of the NIR-Spoon for evaluating the mixing proportion of multi-mixture powdery food in two ways. \n\nFirstly, a CNN for multi-regression (CNN-MR) was proposed for spectra processing. This CNN-MR was used to process the spectra obtained from the NIR-Spoon and estimate the mixing proportion of the multi-mixture powdery food. The results showed that the CNN-MR achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.035 and a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.976, which was an improvement compared to the benchmark partial least squares regression (PLSR) method.\n\nSecondly, a CNN for feature selection (CNN-FS) was proposed to select the most relevant features from the spectra. The CNN-FS algorithm selected 25 features that were deemed important for estimating the mixing proportion. The CNN-MR, when using these selected features, still achieved a high correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.970.\n\nOverall, the utilization of CNNs in the research allowed for improved accuracy in estimating the mixing proportion of multi-mixture powdery food using the NIR-Spoon."

The CNN-MR method achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.035 and a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.976, which are better than the RMSE of 0.059 and R2 of 0.938 achieved by the PLSR model. This indicates that the CNN-MR method provides a further improvement in accuracy compared to the benchmark method."
