        "input": "",
        "Output": "The spectral feature processing methods used were the sole use of Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices (D1), the addition of SAR S1 dataset and derivatives to the S2 datasets and derivatives, and the combined use of spectral, backscatter, and image objects (S2+S1+image objects)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the dataset combining spectral pixels with image objects (D3) can be considered as a superior method compared to traditional methods for accurately segregating agroforestry cocoa from open canopy forest cover in the High Forest Zone of Ghana. The study conducted in the Juaboso-Bia REDD+ Hotspot Intervention Area showed that D3 significantly improved the overall classification output with an overall accuracy (OA) of 89.76% and a kappa (k) value of 0.877. This is compared to D1, which had an OA of 79.02% and k value of 0.748, and D2, which had an OA of 80.49% and k value of 0.765. The use of spectral pixels combined with image objects increased the overall classification accuracy and specifically improved the accuracy of isolating agroforestry cocoa from open canopy forest cover. This method provides an improved decision support for government-led monitoring and the private sector's commitment to halt cocoa-driven deforestation in the High Forest Zone of Ghana."
