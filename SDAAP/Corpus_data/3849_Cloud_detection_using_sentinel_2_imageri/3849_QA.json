Both XGBoost and RF exhibited similar performance when using traditional texture features and deep features. However, in the second phase of the study, XGBoost showed better generalization capabilities in different environmental conditions. Additionally, when compared to threshold-based methods such as Function of Mask (Fmask), Sen2cor, and Maccs-Atcor Joint Method (MAJA), XGBoost and RF-based cloud detection were considered to be a good alternative to existing state-of-the-art cloud detection methods."
