        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the detection accuracy of the proposed method is the relative error. The text states that the detection accuracy achieved by the method is a relative error of less than 10%. However, it does not specify how far this metric can go beyond the mentioned threshold."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of bidirectional dictionary LASSO regression (BD-LASSO) in the proposed online detection method for water quality in wastewater treatment plants is to implement dictionary learning from both spectrum and feature aspects. This allows for information extraction at the feature level, improving the detection accuracy and speed. BD-LASSO helps to effectively eliminate interference caused by turbidity, resulting in a higher detection accuracy (relative error <10%) and a shorter detection time (within 5 min)."
