        "Output": "The related study used data from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) sensor of the Sentinel-3B satellite and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of the Terra satellite to analyze the thematic accuracy of burned area maps and their sensitivity under different spectral resolutions in the Cerrado biome. The methodology employed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and training to analyze the spectral peculiarities of each orbital platform. The Transformed Divergence (TD) index separability statistic was used to assess the spectral separability of burned areas. The study found that the near-infrared (NIR) band played a crucial role in detecting burned areas, exhibiting high separability. However, the study also identified factors such as spectral mixing problems, registration date, and spatial resolution of 500 m that contributed to commission errors ranging between 15% and 72% and omission errors between 51% and 86% for both sensors. Overall, the study highlighted the importance of multispectral sensors for monitoring forest fires while acknowledging that spectral resolution and burning date could impact the detection process."
