The ensemble bagged trees method had a composite prediction accuracy of 93% for silt-loam soil samples and 93% for wheat stalk residue samples. In comparison, the index-based method had a prediction accuracy of 86% for silt-loam soil samples and only 30% for wheat stalk residue samples."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral data and machine learning algorithms tested in this study can be used to quantify material properties in agricultural applications more effectively than traditional methods. The study found that using machine learning algorithms, such as cubic support vector machine (SVM) and ensemble bagged trees, resulted in higher prediction accuracies for both silt-loam soil and wheat stalk residue samples compared to the traditional index-based method. The composite prediction accuracies achieved by the machine learning methods were 96% and 93% for silt-loam soil samples, and 86% and 93% for wheat stalk residue samples, respectively. In contrast, the prediction accuracy using the index-based method was only 86% for silt-loam soil and 30% for wheat stalk residue. Therefore, the machine learning methods demonstrated a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy, indicating their effectiveness in quantifying material properties in agricultural applications."
