The study compared several families of machine learning algorithms based on remote sensing data input from Sentinel 2 spectral bands to assess the goodness of fit between satellite-based estimates and laboratory measurements for 21 physico-chemical water parameters. The chosen metric can go as far as minimizing the values of performance metrics for the tested water physico-chemical parameters."

        "Output": "The results of the related study support the use of remote sensing data from Sentinel 2 for estimating water physico-chemical properties in the Danube Delta compared to traditional laboratory-measured values. The study employed machine learning algorithms and remote sensing data input from Sentinel 2 spectral bands to predict the values of 21 water physico-chemical parameters. The estimates for several parameters such as alkalinity, calcium, chloride, carbon dioxide, hardness, potassium, sodium, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, sulphates, and suspended matter showed promising results, with an overall percentage bias of +/- 10% from the observed values. For parameters like copper, magnesium, nitrites, nitrates, turbidity, and zinc, the estimates were fairly accurate, with percentage biases in the range of +/- 10% - 20%. \n\nThese findings indicate that remote sensing data from Sentinel 2 can provide fairly good estimates for most water physico-chemical parameters when compared to traditional laboratory-measured values. This suggests that remote sensing can be a valuable tool for monitoring and assessing water quality in the Danube Delta, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional laboratory analysis."
