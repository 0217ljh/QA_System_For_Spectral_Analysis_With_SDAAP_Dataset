        "Output": "In the study on the estimation of soil moisture content using hyperspectral remote sensing technology and the application of the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, the following spectral feature processing methods were used to filter the redundant variables:\n\n1. Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT): DWT was used to decompose the original spectral data into 8 levels using the db4 wavelet basis. The correlation coefficients between soil moisture content (SMC) and the spectra of each level were computed to select the maximum level of DWT.\n\n2. CARS (the adaptive variable weighting algorithm): CARS was used in conjunction with wavelet transform to optimize the variables. It helped in filtering out redundant wavelength variables and selecting the ones with better correlation with SMC.\n\n3. SPA (successive projections algorithm): SPA was also used in conjunction with wavelet transform to filter the redundant variables. It further refined the selection of wavelength variables based on their correlation with SMC.\n\n4. CARS-SPA: The combination of CARS and SPA algorithms was used to filter the redundant variables and select the wavelength variables with better correlation with SMC. This coupling algorithm simplified the model complexity and increased the robustness of the model."

Determination Coefficient of Calibration (R-c(2)): This parameter indicates the proportion of the variance in the soil moisture content that can be explained by the prediction model during the calibration phase.\n\n3. Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP): This parameter measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values of soil moisture content during the prediction phase.\n\n4. Determination Coefficient of Prediction (R-p(2)): This parameter indicates the proportion of the variance in the soil moisture content that can be explained by the prediction model during the prediction phase.\n\n5. Relative Prediction Deviation (RPD): This parameter is a measure of the accuracy of the prediction model, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of the reference values to the root mean square error of prediction.
