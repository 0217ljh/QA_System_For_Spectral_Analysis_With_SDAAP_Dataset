        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the developed method is the support vector machine regression (SVR) model prediction set parameters. Specifically, the metrics used are Rp2, RMSEP, and RPD. \n\nRp2 measures the coefficient of determination between the predicted and actual values of heavy metal lead (Pb) concentration. It indicates the proportion of the variance in the predicted values that can be explained by the actual values. A higher Rp2 value indicates a better fit of the model.\n\nRMSEP (Root Mean Square Error of Prediction) measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values of heavy metal lead concentration. It provides an estimate of the accuracy of the predictions. A lower RMSEP value indicates higher accuracy.\n\nRPD (Residual Predictive Deviation) is a measure of the ratio between the standard deviation of the reference values and the RMSEP. It assesses the precision of the predictions. A higher RPD value indicates higher precision.\n\nThese metrics collectively evaluate the accuracy, precision, and fit of the developed method for heavy metal lead detection."

        "Output": "The study verified the potential of fluorescence hyperspectral technology combined with deep learning algorithms for detecting heavy metals in oilseed rape leaves by developing a deep learning method involving wavelet transform (WT) and stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE). The study used the standard normalized variable (SNV) algorithm as the best preprocessing algorithm and applied it to the fluorescence spectral data of oilseed rape leaves. Wavelet transform (WT) was then used to decompose the SNV-treated fluorescence spectra to obtain optimal wavelet decomposition layers using different wavelet basis functions. Stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) was used for deep feature learning under the optimal wavelet decomposition layer. The best established support vector machine regression (SVR) model prediction set parameters were determined, with Rp2, RMSEP, and RPD values of 0.9388, 0.0199 mg/kg, and 3.275, respectively, using sym7 as the wavelet basis function. These results demonstrated the potential of fluorescence hyperspectral technology combined with deep learning algorithms in detecting heavy metals in oilseed rape leaves."
