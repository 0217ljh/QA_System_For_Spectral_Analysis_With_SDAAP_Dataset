        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of midinfrared-spectrum images in the CNN model can be considered superior to traditional methods for classifying colon cancer and noncancerous colon tissues. Traditional methods, such as machine-learning-based algorithms like support-vector-machine (SVM) models, may result in biased results and deviations depending on the initial data and threshold values. On the other hand, the CNN model, which is a deep-learning-based algorithm, has been shown to effectively classify colon cancer tissue and noncancerous colon tissue using midinfrared-spectrum images. This approach is not only effective for submillimeter-sized tissue microarray (TMA) samples but also for routine colon cancer tissue samples that are a few tens of millimeters in size. Therefore, the CNN model offers a more accurate and reliable method for classifying colon cancer and noncancerous colon tissues compared to traditional methods."
