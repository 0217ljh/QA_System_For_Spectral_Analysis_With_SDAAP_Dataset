The text mentions the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) signals to classify different working memory load levels. However, it does not compare the accuracy or performance of spectroscopic methods to traditional methods. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine whether the classification accuracy achieved in this study can be attributed to the superiority of spectroscopic methods over traditional methods."
