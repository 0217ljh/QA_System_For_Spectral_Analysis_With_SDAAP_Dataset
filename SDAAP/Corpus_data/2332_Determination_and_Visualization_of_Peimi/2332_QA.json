        "Output": "In the study, three machine learning models were utilized to analyze the spectral data and predict the peimine and peiminine content in Fritillaria thunbergii bulbi. These models were:\n\n1. Partial Least Squares (PLS): PLS regression was used to build a regression model using the full spectra and optimal wavelengths. PLS is a statistical method that finds the linear relationship between the spectral data and the reference peimine and peiminine content determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This model was used for calibration, cross-validation, and prediction.\n\n2. Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM): LS-SVM was also employed to build a regression model using the full spectra and optimal wavelengths. LS-SVM is a variant of support vector machine (SVM) that performs regression tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best fits the spectral data and predicts the peimine and peiminine content. This model was used for calibration, cross-validation, and prediction.\n\n3. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM): ELM was used as another regression model to analyze the spectral data and predict the peimine and peiminine content."
