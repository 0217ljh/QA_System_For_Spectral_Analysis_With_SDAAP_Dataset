        "Output": "In the study, the machine learning models were utilized to classify the moldy grades of maize kernels based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with sparse auto-encoders (SAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. \n\nFirst, the HSI data in the range of 400-1000 nm were obtained to capture the spectral information of the maize kernels. \n\nThe SAE algorithm was then used to represent the depth spectral features of the HSI data. This algorithm helps in learning a compact representation of the spectral features by reducing the dimensionality of the data. \n\nNext, the CNN algorithm was applied to extract image features from the HSI data. CNNs are effective in capturing spatial patterns and features from images. \n\nThe spectral features obtained from SAE and the image features extracted by CNN were combined. \n\nThree different classifiers, namely K nearest neighbors, support vector machine (SVM), and partial least squares discriminant analysis, were used in combination with the spectral and image features to establish classification models. \n\nThe fusion of SAE and CNN combined with the SVM classifier, known as the SAE-CNN-SVM model, yielded the most satisfactory identification results."

The comparison results indicated that this fusion model had the most satisfactory identification result with high correct recognition rates of 99.47% and 98.94% for the training and testing sets, respectively. Additionally, the values of sensitivity and specificity were 0.95-1, further demonstrating the effectiveness of this model. Therefore, the SAE-CNN-SVM model with hyperspectral imaging can provide good recognition ability for the early detection of moldy maize kernels, potentially supporting the development of online detection during storage."
