        "Output": "Yes, the fine-tuned self-organizing map (SOM) approach for cloud masking in Sentinel-2 images using spectral features can be considered superior to traditional algorithms such as Sen2Cor and Fmask. The study evaluated the performance of the fine-tuned SOM and compared it to the state-of-the-art algorithms Sen2Cor and Fmask. It was shown that the fine-tuned SOM successfully recognized the bright non-cloud areas and outperformed these traditional algorithms. The evaluation was done both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the behavior of the fine-tuned SOM was interpreted through multiple visualization techniques. Therefore, based on the results of this study, the fine-tuned SOM approach can be considered superior to traditional algorithms for cloud masking in Sentinel-2 images."
