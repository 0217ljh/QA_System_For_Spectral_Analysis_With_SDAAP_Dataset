        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed method is the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It provides a measure of how well the model is able to predict the quality parameters of the agricultural products.\n\nThe text states that the proposed method achieved better performance compared to other sample selection strategies, such as random sampling (RS), traditional Kennard-Stone (KS), and joint x-y distances (SPXY). The RMSE of the soluble solid content prediction models based on the proposed unsupervised active learning algorithm was reduced by 2.0% to 13.2% compared to the other three algorithms. Similarly, the RMSE of the firmness prediction models was reduced by 1.2% to 15.7%.\n\nTherefore, the proposed method's performance, as evaluated by the RMSE metric, shows a significant improvement in predicting the quality parameters of agricultural products compared to other algorithms."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed training sample selection strategy based on unsupervised active learning aims to improve the model accuracy in near-infrared spectroscopy regression tasks while minimizing destructive physical and chemical experiments by selecting the most representative samples for labeling. \n\nFirstly, the method divides the diversity of unlabeled spectral datasets through hierarchical agglomerative clustering, creating different clustering clusters. This clustering helps to identify different groups or categories within the dataset.\n\nThen, the locally linear reconstruction method is used to select the most representative samples from each clustering cluster. This selection process ensures that the chosen samples are diverse and representative of the overall dataset.\n\nThese selected samples are then used to form a training sample set, which is used to establish a partial least squares regression model. This model is trained to predict the quality parameters of the unlabeled samples.\n\nBy carefully selecting representative samples for labeling, the proposed method reduces the number of labeled samples needed for training the model. This reduces the time and economic costs associated with labeling samples and avoids destructive physical and chemical experiments.\n\nThe experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing sample selection strategies, such as random sampling, traditional Kennard-Stone, and joint x-y distances."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed training sample selection strategy based on unsupervised active learning is superior to traditional methods in terms of reducing the need for destructive physical and chemical experiments in near-infrared spectroscopy regression tasks. The method selects the most representative samples from unlabeled spectral datasets using hierarchical agglomerative clustering and locally linear reconstruction. By establishing a partial least squares regression model based on the selected training samples, the method can predict the quality parameters of unlabeled samples without the need for destructive experiments.\n\nCompared to traditional methods such as random sampling (RS), traditional Kennard-Stone (KS), and joint x-y distances (SPXY), the proposed method achieves optimal performance. It reduces the root mean square error of the soluble solid content prediction models by 2.0% to 13.2% and the root mean square error of the firmness prediction models by 1.2% to 15.7%. This indicates that the proposed method can effectively improve the model accuracy and reduce the reliance on destructive physical and chemical experiments in model training."
