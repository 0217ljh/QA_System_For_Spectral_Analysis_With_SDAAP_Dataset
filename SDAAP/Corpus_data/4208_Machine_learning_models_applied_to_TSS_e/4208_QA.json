The results showed that the Support Vector Machine Radial Sigma (SVM-RS) model had the highest accuracy, with an r^2 value of 0.87. This indicates that the SVM-RS model was able to explain 87% of the variability in the TSS data, suggesting a strong correlation between the predicted and observed TSS values. On the other hand, the Random Forest (RF), Enhanced Adaptive Regression Through Hinges (EARTH), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Cubist models had limitations that hindered their use in accurately estimating TSS in reservoirs."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the results of the related study, the use of a multispectral sensor onboard a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) can be considered superior to traditional methods for monitoring the concentration of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in reservoirs. The study demonstrated that the multispectral sensor, specifically the MicaSense RedEdge sensor, had high accuracy in estimating TSS in small reservoirs. This suggests that the use of orbital sensors, such as the one used in this study, can overcome the limitations of conventional monitoring methods, which use point sampling and do not adequately represent the spatial variability of water quality parameters. Therefore, the use of a multispectral sensor onboard an RPA, combined with machine learning algorithms, can provide a more effective and cost-efficient approach to monitoring TSS in reservoirs."
