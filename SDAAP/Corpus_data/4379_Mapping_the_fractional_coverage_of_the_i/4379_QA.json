        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to identify the optimal fit between land cover fractions and the spectral information of Sentinel-2 is the Random Forest (RF) model. The RF model is used to analyze the relationship between the land cover fractions obtained from the UAV orthoimages and the spectral information from Sentinel-2. By using the RF model, an optimal fit is determined to correct the spatial offset between the two datasets."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The developed methodological framework using UAV and satellite data provides a more efficient and cost-effective approach compared to traditional methods in estimating the fractional coverage of Ulex europaeus. Traditional methods typically rely on labor-intensive fieldwork, which can be time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, the combination of UAV and satellite data allows for large-scale mapping of invasive species, such as Ulex europaeus, across large areas.\n\nThe framework involves three main steps: land cover classification of UAV orthoimages, reducing the spatial shift between UAV-based land cover classification maps and Sentinel-2 imagery, and identifying optimal satellite acquisition dates. By using machine learning techniques, the spatial offset between the UAV and satellite data is corrected, leading to a significant improvement in estimating the current distribution of Ulex europaeus.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that the Sentinel-2 acquisition from November, which coincides with the flowering time of Ulex europaeus, was particularly important in distinguishing this invasive species from other plant species. This highlights the effectiveness of the developed framework in accurately identifying and mapping Ulex europaeus.\n\nOverall, the developed methodological framework using UAV and satellite data offers a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods in estimating the fractional coverage of Ulex europaeus."
