        "Output": "In the related study on the detection of diseases in maize seeds using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and deep learning methods, three fusion strategies were employed: data-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and decision-level fusion.\n\n1. Data-level fusion: This strategy involves combining different types of feature data at the data level. In this study, successive projections algorithm (SPA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to extract feature variables. By fusing these different types of feature data, the analysis and identification of diseases in maize seeds were enhanced.\n\n2. Feature-level fusion: This strategy involves combining different types of feature data at the feature level. In this study, the spectral features, color features, and texture features were considered. The results showed that the modeling performance based on spectral features outperformed that based on color and texture features. By fusing these different types of feature data at the feature level, the accuracy of disease identification was improved.\n\n3. Decision-level fusion: This strategy involves combining the decisions made by different classification models. In this study, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN-RB) were used to build classification models.

The study demonstrates that the modeling performance based on spectral features outperforms that based on color and texture features. The accuracy of the convolutional neural network (CNN-RB) model, which utilizes deep learning, was 94.44%, higher than the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models. Additionally, the decision-level fusion technique, which combines multiple sources of information, achieved the highest accuracy of 98.12%. These results suggest that the proposed HSI and deep learning methods can effectively enhance feature extraction and improve recognition performance, indicating their superiority over traditional methods in disease detection in maize seeds."
