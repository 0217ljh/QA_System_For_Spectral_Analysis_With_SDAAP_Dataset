        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for food tray sealing fault detection is accuracy. The accuracy achieved for different deep learning methods in the studied dataset was 88.7% for Deep Belief Network (DBN), 88.3% for Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), 89.3% for Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE), and 90.1% for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Therefore, the accuracy metric can go up to 90.1% in terms of accuracy for the proposed approach."

The related study specifically focuses on food tray sealing fault detection using hyperspectral images. Therefore, it is unclear whether this approach can be directly applied to other types of food packaging inspections to improve efficiency and accuracy. Further research or information would be needed to determine the applicability of this approach to other types of food packaging inspections."
