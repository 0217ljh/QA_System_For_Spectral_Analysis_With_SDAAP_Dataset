        "Output": "Yes, the proposed random forest-based algorithm can be considered superior to traditional methods in distinguishing Ulm prolifera and Sargassum from GF-1 WFV images. The algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 97.6% in distinguishing the two species, except when they were mixed together. This algorithm is more robust than existing methods as it allowed more Sargassum samples from different ocean regions to be used in the training, and it avoids negative effects caused by the selection of a threshold. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is proven effective in distinguishing Ulm prolifera and Sargassum in the Yellow and East China Seas and in detecting Sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean."
