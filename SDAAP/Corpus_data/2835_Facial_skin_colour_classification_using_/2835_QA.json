        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the developed two-stage integrated classifier, based on hyperspectral imaging and machine learning, can be used to accurately categorize the high granularity labels of facial skin-colour types used in the beauty industry. The study found that various machine-learning methods had advantages in categorizing different subsets of colour types. By analyzing the features of the data, it was discovered that skin chromaticity and brightness could be classified separately to provide valuable information. The two-stage integrated classifier, which combines the advantages of various machine-learning methods, achieved an accuracy of 90.4%. This classifier can be utilized by the beauty industry to evaluate the effect of skincare products on facial skin colour."
