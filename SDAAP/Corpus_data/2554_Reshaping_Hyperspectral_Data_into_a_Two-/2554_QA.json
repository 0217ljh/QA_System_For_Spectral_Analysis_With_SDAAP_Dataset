        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models for species identification based on leaf-level hyperspectral data was accuracy. The related study states that the best-performing CNN model had a validation accuracy of 98.6% and a prediction accuracy of 91.6%. \n\nAccuracy is a commonly used metric in classification tasks and measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances. In the context of species classification, accuracy indicates how well the CNN model is able to correctly identify the species based on the leaf-level hyperspectral data.\n\nWhile accuracy is an important metric, it does not provide a complete picture of the model's performance. Other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can provide additional insights into the model's ability to correctly classify different species."
