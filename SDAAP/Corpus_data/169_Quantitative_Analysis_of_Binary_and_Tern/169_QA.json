As the mixture composition increased, the advantages of using a nonlinear model for analysis became more apparent. \n\nOne advantage of the LS-SVM model is that it has a fixed modeling step compared to BPNN, which means it does not require complicated parameter discussion and optimization. This makes LS-SVM more efficient in realizing the quantitative analysis of multivariate mixtures.\n\nAdditionally, the past study observed that the spectral characteristics of the analyte also affect the accuracy of quantitative detection to some extent. This implies that the nonlinear models, LS-SVM and BPNN, may be better suited to capture and analyze the complex spectral characteristics of multivariate mixtures compared to the traditional linear model, PLS.\n\nOverall, the past study suggests that in the quantitative analysis of multivariate mixtures, the advantages of using nonlinear models, such as LS-SVM and BPNN,"
