The AUC is a commonly used metric in medical diagnosis to assess the accuracy of a classifier. In this study, the ML classifier achieved an AUC of 92% with cross-validation, indicating a high level of accuracy in differentiating between GBM and BM."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the radiomic features-based Machine Learning (ML) classifier trained from post-contrast 3DT1 MR imaging can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods in differentiating between Glioblastomas (GBM) and Brain Metastases (BM), compared to human experts' blinded examination. The ML classifier had a high performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The sensitivity and specificity of the ML classifier were 85% and 87% respectively, with a balanced accuracy of 86% and an AUC of 92% with cross-validation. On the test set, the ML classifier achieved a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 86%, balanced accuracy of 80%, and an AUC of 85%. These results indicate that the ML classifier performed comparably to the human experts' blinded examination, with no statistically significant differences observed between the two methods. Therefore, the radiomic features-based ML classifier shows promise as a reliable and accurate tool for differentiating between GBM and BM."
