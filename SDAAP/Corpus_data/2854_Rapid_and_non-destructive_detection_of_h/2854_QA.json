        "Output": "In the study, three machine learning models were utilized to classify the chickpeas into HTC and ETC categories. These models were Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Convolutional Neural Network-Attention (CNN-ATT). The models were developed based on the full spectrum and significant wavelengths of the NIR hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data obtained from the chickpeas. The optimal models were obtained using SVC and CNN-ATT, which demonstrated 100% accuracy in classifying the chickpeas into HTC and ETC categories."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the study's findings, the near infrared hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system can be considered superior to traditional methods in classifying chickpeas into Hard to Cook (HTC) and Easy to Cook (ETC) categories. The study used the NIR-HSI system to classify chickpeas based on their spectral data, and the models developed using this system demonstrated 100% accuracy in classifying the chickpeas into HTC and ETC categories. This suggests that the NIR-HSI system is an effective and reliable method for classifying chickpeas, surpassing traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency."
