The RMSE values obtained in this study ranged between 0.378 and 0.466 t/ha. This metric measures the average difference between the predicted carbon stock values and the actual carbon stock values in the reforested urban landscape.\n\nThe RMSE can provide a measure of the overall accuracy of the carbon stock estimation using Sentinel-2 spectral data."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of Sentinel-2 spectral data for quantifying carbon stock in a reforested urban landscape can be considered superior to traditional methods. The related study found that Sentinel-2 spectral data provided accurate and concise quantification of forest carbon stocks in a reforested urban landscape. The use of random forest ensemble with Sentinel-2 data resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE) between 0.378 and 0.466 t/ha and R-squared values of 79.82% and 77.96% for calibration and validation datasets, respectively. This indicates that the Sentinel-2 spectral data-based approach can effectively estimate carbon stock in reforested urban landscapes. Additionally, the related study identified specific spectral indices, such as the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, modified simple ratio index, and normalized difference vegetation index, as the best predictor variables for carbon stock. These findings highlight the value and prospects of using Sentinel-2 spectral data for predicting carbon stock in reforested urban landscapes, providing critical information for informed management policies and plans to optimize carbon sequestration capacity and climate change mitigation potential."
