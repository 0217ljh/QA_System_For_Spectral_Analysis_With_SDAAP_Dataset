By observing the spectra of these metal devices, they were able to achieve rough classification. To further enhance the classification process, they conducted principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of the spectral data. This allowed them to establish a model based on the three principal components as the coordinate axis in the principal component space. Finally, they employed the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to verify the classification effectiveness, resulting in a final classification accuracy of 99%."
