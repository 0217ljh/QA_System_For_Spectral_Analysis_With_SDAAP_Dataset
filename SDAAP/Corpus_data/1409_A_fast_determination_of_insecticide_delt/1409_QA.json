By combining ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), and fusion strategies, the low-level fusion strategy demonstrated better predictive ability compared to mid-level fusion and individual methods. It achieved a lower root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.0645% and a higher coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.9978. This approach proved to be an efficient method for the rapid analysis of deltamethrin formulations, making it valuable for pesticide quality control and on-site monitoring."
