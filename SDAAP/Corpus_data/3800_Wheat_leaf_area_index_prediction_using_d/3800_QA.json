        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of LAI estimation in the study is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The study found that after removing the soil background from the high-resolution UAV imagery, the accuracy of LAI prediction for wheat improved significantly. The R-2 value increased by approximately 0.27, indicating a higher level of explained variance in the LAI estimation. Additionally, the RMSE decreased by about 0.476, indicating a reduction in the average difference between the predicted and actual LAI values. Therefore, the chosen metric of R-2 and RMSE demonstrated the improvement in accuracy of LAI estimation in the study."
