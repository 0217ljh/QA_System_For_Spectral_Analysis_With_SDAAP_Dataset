        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the models in the past study was the coefficient of determination (R-2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the concentration of elements that can be explained by the models. The R-2 values ranged from 0.00 to 0.89, indicating that the models were able to explain between 0% and 89% of the variance in the concentration of elements in soils and sediments. However, it should be noted that the prediction of the concentration of elements in sediments through models calibrated with soils had low accuracy, with an average R-2 of 0.11. Therefore, the accuracy of the models can vary depending on the specific element and the type of sample (soil or sediment) being analyzed."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The multivariate models, such as partial least square regression (PLSR) and support vector machine (SVM), were evaluated in the past study by combining them with spectral pre-processing techniques (Detrend, Savitzky-Golay Derivative, and Standard Normal Variate) and comparing them to the raw spectrum (RAW). The accuracy of the models was assessed by comparing the predictions of the concentration of elements in soils and sediments to the actual values obtained through wet oxidation and ICP-OES analysis. The performance of the models was measured using the coefficient of determination (R-2), with higher values indicating better predictions."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for accurately estimating the concentration of elements in soils and sediments. The past study evaluated multivariate methods and pre-processing techniques and found that the support vector machine (SVM) model combined with spectral pre-processing techniques resulted in better predictions for soils, sediments, and soils + sediments. The accuracy of the predictions was further increased by using NIR spectroscopy with pre-processing techniques compared to using the raw spectrum. Therefore, NIR spectroscopy with appropriate multivariate models and pre-processing techniques can provide fast and low-cost estimation of element concentrations in soils and sediments."
