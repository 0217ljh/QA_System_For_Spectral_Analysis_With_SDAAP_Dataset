        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to analyze the accuracy of the estimation methods to estimate the biomass of individual organs was the coefficient of determination (r^2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The coefficient of determination measures the proportion of the variance in the biomass estimation that can be explained by the model, with values ranging from 0 to 1. A higher r^2 value indicates a better fit between the estimated and measured biomass. The root mean square error measures the average difference between the estimated and measured biomass, with lower values indicating higher accuracy.\n\nIn terms of estimating the biomass of individual organs, the study found that the MGPRS model using the combined indices (SOMVI and SODVI) as input achieved the best predictive accuracy. The r^2 values for stem biomass estimation ranged from 0.71 to 0.84, while the r^2 values for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation ranged from 0.67 to 0.87. The RMSE values for stem biomass ranged from 0.4 to 1.12 kg/m^2, and for AGB estimation, they ranged from 0.16 to 0.56 kg/m^2."

        "Output": "The performance of combined indices (SOMVI and SODVI) and MGPRS in estimating the biomass of individual organs in rice crops using a combination of optical and SAR imagery was compared to traditional methods. The results showed that the combined indices performed better than those derived from either the optical or SAR data alone. \n\nIn terms of biomass estimation, the best predictive accuracy was achieved by the MGPRS using SODVI as input. The r(2) value for stem biomass was 0.84, with an RMSE of 0.4 kg/m(2), while for aboveground biomass (AGB), the r(2) value was 0.87, with an RMSE of 0.16 kg/m(2). This was higher than using SOMVI as input for the MGPRS or using single-target Gaussian process regression (SGPR).\n\nFor leaf biomass estimation, relatively higher accuracy was achieved using SOMVI as input for the MGPRS, with an r(2) value of 0.83, compared to using SODVI as input, which had an r(2) value of 0.73."
