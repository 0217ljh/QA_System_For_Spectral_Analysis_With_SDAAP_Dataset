        "Output": "The results of the past study support the use of machine learning methods over linear multivariate methods for predicting soil properties using visible and near infrared spectroscopy. The past study compared the predictive performance of two linear multivariate methods (principal component regression and partial least squares regression) with two machine learning methods (least squares support vector machines and Cubist) for estimating soil total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), and moisture content (MC).\n\nThe past study found that the machine learning methods (LS-SVM and Cubist) outperformed the linear multivariate methods in predicting all three soil properties. LS-SVM provided the best prediction for MC and OC, while the Cubist method provided the best prediction for TN. This indicates that machine learning methods are capable of tackling non-linear problems in the dataset, which is often the case in soil spectroscopy.\n\nFurthermore, the past study reported the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and residual prediction deviation (RPD) values for each method. The machine learning methods had lower RMSEP values and higher RPD values compared to the linear multivariate methods, indicating better prediction accuracy and reliability.\n\nTherefore, based on these findings, it can be concluded that machine learning methods are more effective and accurate in predicting soil properties using visible and near infrared spectroscopy"
