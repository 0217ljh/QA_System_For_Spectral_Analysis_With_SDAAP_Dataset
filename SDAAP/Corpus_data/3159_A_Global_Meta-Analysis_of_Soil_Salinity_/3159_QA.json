        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the model accuracy in this study is the R-2 (R-squared) value and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (soil salinity in this case) that can be explained by the independent variables (features used in the model). The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values of soil salinity."
