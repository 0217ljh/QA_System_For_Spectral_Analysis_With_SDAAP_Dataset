        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral measurements and machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate the dust retention content (DRC) on plant leaves in a more accurate and efficient manner compared to traditional methods. The integration of machine learning algorithms with hyperspectral data allows for the identification of important variables and the development of estimation models. In this study, the random forest (RF) algorithm was used to identify important hyperspectral variables, and three machine learning techniques (support vector machine, classification and regression tree, and RF) were used to develop estimation models for DRC. The results showed that the SVM and RF models performed well, with estimations similar to the measured DRC. The average le for SVM and RF model were 0.85 and 0.88, indicating a high level of accuracy. This technical approach of using hyperspectral measurements and machine learning algorithms proved to be successful in estimating DRC on plant leaves. Therefore, it can be concluded that hyperspectral measurements and machine learning algorithms offer a more accurate and efficient method for estimating DRC compared to traditional methods."
