        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the DOM humification level was the self-organizing map (SOM). This method was used to analyze the fluorescence spectroscopy data and determine the humification level of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the lakes. The SOM model identified representative neurons (1, 11, 25, and 36) to assess the humification level.\n\nThe SOM analysis was able to differentiate the lakes based on their non-point source inputs. It found that the Gaotang Lake (GT), which had mainly agricultural non-point source inputs, had a significantly higher humification level compared to the Yaogao Reservoir (YG), which had mainly terrestrial source inputs. This differentiation was statistically significant (P < 0.01), indicating that the SOM metric was effective in distinguishing the humification levels between the two lakes."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning models, specifically a self-organizing map (SOM), were utilized to assess the dissolved organic matter (DOM) humification level in the lakes with different non-point source inputs. The SOM model was combined with conventional three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy methods to analyze the DOM properties.\n\nIn the study, representative neurons (1, 11, 25, and 36) were selected to assess the DOM humification level. The SOM model was able to differentiate between the two lakes based on their non-point source inputs. It showed that the Gaotang Lake (GT), which had a mainly agricultural non-point source input, had a significantly higher DOM humification level compared to the Yaogao Reservoir (YG), which had a mainly terrestrial source input.\n\nBy analyzing the fluorescence regional integral (FRI) in five representative areas, the SOM model further revealed that during the flat water period, the GT water column exhibited more terrestrial characteristics. However, both lakes had humus-like fractions in the DOM derived from microbial decomposition.\n\nOverall, the SOM model, a machine learning technique, played a crucial role in assessing and comparing the DOM humification level in the lakes with different non-point source inputs."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Spectroscopic methods were utilized in assessing the sources and properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the lakes with different non-point source inputs by using conventional three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. This method involves analyzing the fluorescence properties of the DOM samples collected from the lakes. The fluorescence spectra provide information about the composition and characteristics of the DOM, allowing researchers to identify different sources and assess the humification level of the DOM. Additionally, a self-organizing map (SOM) was used in combination with the spectroscopic methods to further analyze and classify the DOM samples based on their humification level and source characteristics."
