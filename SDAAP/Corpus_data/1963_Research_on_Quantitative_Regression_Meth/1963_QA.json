        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, according to the study, the use of characteristic wavelengths combined with ensemble learning can indeed improve the modeling efficiency and prediction accuracy of organic infrared spectra in the quantitative analysis. The study found that the ensemble learning model, specifically the Stacking model, showed improved prediction accuracy compared to the traditional partial least squares (PLS) quantitative regression model. Additionally, when the characteristic wavelengths were selected using the combined partial least squares (SiPLS) and successive projections algorithm (SPA), the prediction results further improved, with the SiPLS-Stacking model achieving the best prediction results for total aromatic content. Furthermore, using the selected characteristic wavelengths reduced the average training time of the model by more than 50%, significantly improving the modeling speed. Overall, the study demonstrates that combining characteristic wavelengths with ensemble learning can enhance the modeling efficiency and prediction accuracy of organic infrared spectra in quantitative analysis."
