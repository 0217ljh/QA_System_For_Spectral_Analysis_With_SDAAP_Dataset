        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction accuracy in this study is RLoo2. RLoo2 is a measure of the coefficient of determination (R-squared) calculated using the leave-one-out (Loo) cross-validation method. It indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (forest volume) that can be explained by the independent variables (remote sensing data and ground survey data). \n\nThe text states that the prediction accuracies of the six models tested in this study are better, with RLoo2 values above 0.6."

        "Output": "The prediction accuracy of machine learning methods and ordinary Kriging hybrid methods was compared in estimating forest volume models based on multi-source remote sensing data combined with ground survey data. The related study found that the prediction accuracies of both methods were better, with RLoo2 values above 0.6. However, the hybrid models, which combined machine learning with the ordinary Kriging method, improved the accuracy of forest volume estimation to different extents. Among the six estimation models tested, the random forest Kriging (RFK) hybrid model had the best prediction effect, with an RLoo2 reaching 0.915. Therefore, the hybrid model constructed by combining machine learning and the ordinary Kriging method greatly improved the accuracy of forest volume estimation compared to using machine learning methods alone."
