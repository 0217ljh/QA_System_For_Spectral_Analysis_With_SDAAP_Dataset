They used multiple scattering correction (MSC) to preprocess the spectra and then applied various pattern recognition algorithms such as PLS-DA, KNN, NB, RF, SVM-Linear, SVM-Polynomial, SVM-RBF, and SVM-Sigmaid. The recognition accuracy of each model was calculated and compared. The results showed that the recognition accuracy of the models established by different algorithms ranged from 80.8% to 100%.

The study demonstrates that using near-infrared spectral data and pattern recognition algorithms, such as PLS-DA, KNN, NB, RF, SVM-Linear, SVM-Polynomial, SVM-RBF, and SVM-Sigmaid, can achieve high recognition accuracy ranging from 84.4% to 100%. Additionally, by using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of hyperspectral data and establishing classification models based on characteristic wavelengths, recognition accuracy ranging from 80.8% to 98.4% was achieved. These results indicate that near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology is effective in classifying different types of maize seeds and detecting their purity. Furthermore, this technology offers the advantages of being rapid and non-destructive, providing a new method for seed purity detection."
