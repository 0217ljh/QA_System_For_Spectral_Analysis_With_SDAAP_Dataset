        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were used to identify cotton seed years with high precision and screen cotton seeds quickly and nondestructively. The researchers collected a total of 1,440 cotton seeds from the years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. These seeds were divided into training, validation, and test sets.\n\nHyperspectral images of the cotton seeds were collected in the range of 915 to 1,698 nm. The average spectra from 1,002 to 1,602 nm were extracted as the raw data, after removing obvious noise at the beginning and the end. The spectra were preprocessed using the Savitzky-Golay smoothing algorithm.\n\nThe principal component analysis loading (PCA-loading) method was then used to select 13 effective wavelengths. Six classification models were established based on the full spectra and the effective wavelengths. These models included logistic regression (LR), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), recurrent neural network (RNN) long-short memory network (LSTM), and convolution neural network (CNN)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of machine learning and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology can be considered superior to traditional methods for identifying cotton seed years with high precision and screening cotton seeds quickly and nondestructively. The related study states that six classification models, including logistic regression, partial least squares discriminant analysis, support vector machine, recurrent neural network, long-short memory network, and convolution neural network, were established based on full spectra and effective wavelengths. These models achieved high identification accuracy, with the CNN and SVM models consistently achieving excellent results. The results indicate that deep learning methods, such as CNN, are generally better than traditional machine learning methods, but both approaches can maintain good identification accuracy. Therefore, the combination of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology and machine learning methods provides a high-precision and nondestructive approach for identifying cotton seed years and screening high-quality cotton seeds."
