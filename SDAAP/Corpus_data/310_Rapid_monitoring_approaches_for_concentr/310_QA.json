        "Output": "Yes, the combination of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRs) and chemometrics can be considered superior to traditional methods for rapid monitoring of the concentration process of lanqin oral solution (LOS) in terms of quality control. The past study developed rapid monitoring methods using NIRs and chemometrics for the quality control of the concentration process of LOS. The quantitative models constructed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) showed satisfactory results with low relative standard error values for various components of LOS. Additionally, the qualitative analysis using the genetic algorithm joint extreme learning machine (GA-ELM) achieved 100% prediction accuracy in distinguishing the end point of the concentration process. These results indicate that the combination of NIRs and chemometrics has great potential in improving the efficiency and accuracy of quality control in the production of LOS."
