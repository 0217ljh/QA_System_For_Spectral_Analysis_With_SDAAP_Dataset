        "Output": "Yes, the non-linear methods used in the study can be considered superior to traditional methods for the fast characterization of organic waste using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in anaerobic digestion plants. The study found that the non-linear methods, such as partial least squares regression (PLSR) based methods, machine learning methods, and deep learning methods, showed errors 28% lower than linear methods. The standard errors of prediction obtained for various parameters were also similar to successful NIRS applications developed on freeze-dried samples. These findings suggest that the non-linear methods have the potential to be more accurate and efficient in characterizing organic waste using NIRS in anaerobic digestion plants."
