        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to predict the potato tubers is the R-2 value, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (water content of potato tubers) that can be explained by the independent variables (selected characteristic bands). \n\nThe R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates that the model can perfectly predict the water content based on the selected characteristic bands. \n\nIn the related study, the best model achieved an R-2 value of 0.8908, indicating that approximately 89.08% of the variance in the water content of potato tubers can be explained by the selected characteristic bands. \n\nTherefore, this metric can go up to a maximum value of 1, representing a perfect prediction of the water content based on the hyperspectral reflectance response."

These algorithms were used to obtain the first 40 effective characteristic spectra of hyperspectral images, which helped reduce data redundancy and improve prediction accuracy. The combined model based on Lasso and XGBoost algorithm was found to have the strongest prediction ability among the models tested."

The study found that this model had the strongest prediction ability compared to other algorithms such as CatBoost and LightGBM. The best model, MF-Lasso-XGBoost, achieved an R-2 value of 0.8908, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting water content. Additionally, the model had low values for RMSE (0.0610) and MAE (0.0389), further indicating its effectiveness in predicting water content. The R-cv(2) value of 0.8448 suggests that the model's performance is consistent and reliable. Overall, the combined model based on Lasso and XGBoost algorithm is superior to traditional methods in predicting the water content of potato tubers using hyperspectral reflectance response."
