        "input": "",
        "Output": "It can be inferred that Raman spectroscopy is a superior method compared to traditional methods for estimating the dependency between glioma tissue and blood serum biomarkers. The past result mentions that Raman spectroscopy was used to study the separability of experimental and control groups, and to discover the most informative Raman spectral bands. Additionally, it states that Raman spectroscopy was able to observe an increase in the contribution of certain biomarkers in dried blood serum Raman spectra during glioblastoma development, which overlapped with results from direct Raman spectroscopy studies of glioma tissues. This suggests that Raman spectroscopy is a valuable tool for tracking changes in the state of brain tissues during glioma development."
