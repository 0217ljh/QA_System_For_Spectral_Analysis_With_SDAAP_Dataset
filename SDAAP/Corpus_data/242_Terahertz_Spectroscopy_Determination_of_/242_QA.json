        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the investigation was the correlation coefficient of prediction (R-p) and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The R-p value of 0.994 indicates a strong correlation between the BA concentrations and THz absorption coefficients, suggesting that the LS-SVM model is effective for predicting the BA additive in wheat flour. The RMSEP value of 0.12% indicates that the model has a low prediction error, further supporting its accuracy. Therefore, this metric can go a long way in the investigation by providing a reliable and precise quantitative analysis of the BA additive in wheat flour."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the investigation, machine learning models were utilized to develop quantitative determination models between benzoic acid (BA) concentrations and terahertz (THz) absorption coefficients in wheat flour. Two machine learning methods, namely partial least square (PLS) regression and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM), were employed.\n\nFirst, correlation analysis was conducted to select a frequency pair of 1.94 and 1.86 THz that improved the predictive ability of multiple linear regressions (MLR) model. This step helped identify the most relevant THz frequencies for measuring BA additive concentrations.\n\nNext, the PLS regression model was used to establish a quantitative determination model between BA concentrations and THz absorption coefficients. This model aimed to predict the BA additive concentrations based on the THz absorption data.\n\nAdditionally, the LS-SVM model was employed as an alternative machine learning method for quality control of wheat flour. This model showed higher effectiveness compared to MLR and PLS models, with a correlation coefficient of prediction (R-p) of 0.994 and a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.12%. The LS-SVM model demonstrated its potential for accurately analyzing BA additive in wheat flour.\n\nOverall, the investigation utilized machine learning models,"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of terahertz spectroscopy and LS-SVM (least square support vector machine) is shown to be more effective than traditional methods, such as multiple linear regressions (MLR) and partial least square (PLS) regression, for quantitatively analyzing benzoic acid (BA) additive in wheat flour. \n\nThe LS-SVM model, when combined with terahertz spectroscopy, demonstrated a high correlation coefficient of prediction (R-p) of 0.994 and a low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.12%. This indicates that the LS-SVM model is able to accurately predict the concentration of BA additive in wheat flour.\n\nIn comparison, MLR and PLS models were also used in the investigation, but the LS-SVM model outperformed them in terms of predictive ability. This suggests that the combination of terahertz spectroscopy and LS-SVM is a more effective tool for quality control and quantitative analysis of BA additive in wheat flour."
