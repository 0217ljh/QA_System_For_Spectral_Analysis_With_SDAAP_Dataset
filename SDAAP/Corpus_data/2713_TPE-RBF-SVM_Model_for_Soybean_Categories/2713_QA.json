        "Output": "Yes, based on the information provided, the TPE-RBF-SVM model can be considered a superior spectroscopic method for pattern recognition of soybean categories based on hyperspectral data. The model demonstrated significantly improved metrics compared to other machine learning algorithms, with an accuracy of 0.9165 in the independent test dataset. This accuracy is 9.786% higher than the vanilla RBF-SVM model and 10.02% higher than the extreme gradient boosting model. Therefore, the TPE-RBF-SVM model is a fast and effective non-destructive testing method for accurately categorizing soybeans based on their internal physical and chemical components."
