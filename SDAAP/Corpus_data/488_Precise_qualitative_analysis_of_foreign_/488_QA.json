        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models based on MSI-LIBS is accuracy. The accuracy of the models was measured using both the cross-validation set and the prediction set. \n\nIn terms of accuracy improvement, the models based on MSI-LIBS showed a significant improvement compared to traditional LIBS. The accuracy of the support vector machine model increased from 80.98% to 85.17% in the cross-validation set, and from 81.50% to 85.82% in the prediction set. Similarly, the accuracy of the k-nearest neighbor model increased from 75.61% to 79.32% in the cross-validation set, and from 76.03% to 79.74% in the prediction set. The accuracy of the random subspace method-linear discriminant analysis model increased from 79.25% to 81.18% in the cross-validation set, and from 79.07% to 81.28% in the prediction set.\n\nTherefore, the metric of accuracy showed a notable improvement in the performance of the models based on MSI-LIBS, indicating the effectiveness of this method in enhancing the accuracy of LIBS classification."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The multidimensional spectral information laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (MSI-LIBS) method is proposed as a novel approach to improve the qualitative accuracy of foreign protein adulteration in milk powder. Compared to traditional LIBS, the performance of models based on MSI-LIBS is significantly enhanced. The accuracy of the cross-validation set of support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and random subspace method-linear discriminant analysis models increased from 80.98%, 75.61%, and 79.25% to 85.17%, 79.32%, and 81.18%, respectively. Similarly, the accuracy of the prediction set increased from 81.50%, 76.03%, and 79.07% to 85.82%, 79.74%, and 81.28%, respectively. Additionally, the visualization results of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding demonstrated a more distinct boundary between the spectra of different samples based on MSI-LIBS. These results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of MSI-LIBS in improving the performance of LIBS classification for detecting foreign protein adulteration in milk powder."
