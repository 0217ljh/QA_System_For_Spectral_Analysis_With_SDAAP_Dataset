        "Output": "The purpose of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the related study was to classify the different drug abusers based on the data collected from the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device. The study aimed to analyze the activation patterns of different functional areas of the prefrontal cortex in drug addicts who used heroin, Methamphetamine, and mixed drugs. By inputting the data of drug abusers with high degrees of activation into CNNs, the researchers were able to classify the different drug abusers and determine the specific activation patterns for each group. This classification using CNNs allowed for a better understanding of the effects of different drugs on brain activation and could potentially contribute to personalized rehabilitation strategies for drug addiction."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, it can be inferred that functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a method used in this study to analyze the effects of different drugs on brain activation in drug abusers. However, the text does not provide a direct comparison between fNIRS and traditional methods. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether fNIRS is considered a superior method compared to traditional methods based solely on the given information."
