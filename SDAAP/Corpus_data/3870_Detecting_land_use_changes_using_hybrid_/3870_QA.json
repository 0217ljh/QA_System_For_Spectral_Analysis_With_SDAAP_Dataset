        "input": "",
        "Output": "The conventional training methods used in the study were Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation (LM), Scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation (SCG), and BFGS quasi-Newton backpropagation (BFG). These methods were compared to the evolutionary algorithms (particle swarm optimization and invasive weed optimization) in terms of their robustness and reliability for detecting changes in agricultural lands through remote sensing data processing. Based on the results of the case study, the evolutionary algorithms were found to be less accurate and computationally complex compared to the conventional training methods. Specifically, the BFG method was slightly more robust than the LM method, but the LM method was preferred for application in projects due to its lower computational complexities."

These methods have been shown to be reliable and robust in detecting agricultural lands, making them suitable for this type of analysis."
