        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification performance of the pipeline for diagnosing hyperspectral skin cancer images is the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC is a commonly used metric in machine learning to assess the performance of binary classification models. In this case, it suggests that the classification performance of the pipeline can be improved to above 90% with appropriate thresholding."
