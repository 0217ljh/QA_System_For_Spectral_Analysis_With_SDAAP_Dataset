        "Output": "In the research, two machine learning algorithms, Gaussian process (GP) regression and extreme learning machine (ELM), were utilized to improve the calibration models for determining the end-point of the column chromatographic process of Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex using near infrared spectroscopy. These algorithms were compared to partial least squares (PLS) regression.\n\nAmong the three algorithms, GP regression showed the greatest potential in developing a robust model. It provided ideal results for determining the end-point of berberine hydrochloride, phellodendrine chloride, and the total alkaloids. This suggests that GP regression can be an efficient tool in improving the calibration models.\n\nAdditionally, the moving block standard deviation (MBSD) algorithm, which is a calibration-free method, was used to accurately detect the elution end-points of berberine hydrochloride and the total alkaloids. This algorithm offers a more convenient way of determining the end-point in the column chromatographic process.\n\nOverall, the research demonstrated that both GP regression and MBSD can be effective tools in improving the calibration models and determining the end-point of the column chromatographic process of Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex."

Based on the findings of the related study, near infrared spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for determining the end-point of the column chromatographic process of Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex. The study applied near infrared spectroscopy to develop a robust calibration model using partial least squares (PLS) regression.

Among these methods, GP regression exhibited the greatest potential to develop a robust model, providing ideal results for the end-point determination of berberine hydrochloride, phellodendrine chloride, and the total alkaloids.
