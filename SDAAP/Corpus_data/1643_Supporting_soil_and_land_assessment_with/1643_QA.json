        "Output": "The metric chosen for analyzing the use of soil feature estimates for soil and land classification is the Vis-NIR technology. This metric can go as far as providing a quick and cheap alternative to subjective determinations, allowing for more precise characterization of soil properties and increasing the density of survey points in vast areas of land."

        "Output": "The effectiveness of the Stacked AutoEncoder, convolutional neural network (CNN), and stack model composed of multilayer perceptron algorithms in predicting soil properties using Vis-NIR spectral response was assessed in the study. The research found that modeling with CNN was identified as the optimal solution. It was determined that similar, and in some cases, better results can be obtained from ensembles of machine learning algorithms. However, the estimates of soil characteristics made with the help of the Stacked AutoEncoder showed the greatest errors. Therefore, the CNN model was found to be the most effective in predicting soil properties using Vis-NIR spectral response."

        "Output": "The accuracy of the proposed Topsoil Quality Index (TQI) based on Vis-NIR spectral response is practically identical to the TQI estimated indirectly based on estimated values of selected soil features. The research confirms the suitability of Vis-NIR spectroscopy for topsoil assessment and shows that the accuracy of the estimation of TQI is comparable whether it is estimated directly or indirectly."
