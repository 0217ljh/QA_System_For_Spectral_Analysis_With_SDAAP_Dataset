        "Output": "The researchers validated the total organic carbon detection algorithm model developed using the Ada-iPLSR method by conducting experiments with total organic carbon standard solution samples. They prepared 43 standard solution samples with concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mg.L-1. Out of these, 35 samples were collected in the first period and used to divide the spectra into training and test sets. The algorithm model was established and verified using these samples. To evaluate the robustness of the model, the remaining 8 standard samples were collected in another period for test verification. The experimental results showed that the model had high accuracy and robustness, with root mean square errors of 1.304 mg.L-1 for group verification and 1.533 mg.L-1 for test verification. These results were better than those obtained using partial least squares regression and Extreme Learning Machine methods."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the Ada-iPLSR method using UV-Vis spectroscopy can be considered superior to traditional methods for the rapid and accurate detection of total organic carbon in surface water. The past study states that the UV-Vis spectroscopy method has the advantages of environmental protection, simple operation, and real-time on-line in-situ detection. It also mentions that the Ada-iPLSR method, which is based on UV-Vis spectroscopy, has high accuracy and robustness in detecting total organic carbon. The experimental results show that the root mean square errors of group verification and test verification are better than other methods such as partial least squares regression and Extreme Learning Machine methods. Additionally, the method is able to quickly and accurately detect total organic carbon in surface water, providing a method support for the on-line detection of total organic carbon in water quality."
