        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to measure the separability of strawberry guava cover classes was the Jeffries-Matusita distance. This metric was used to compute the separability between different classes based on the Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix texture measures and spectral indices (ARI1 and ReNDVI). The addition of these features, along with the spectral bands, substantially increased the separability of strawberry guava cover classes.\n\nThe use of the Jeffries-Matusita distance as a metric for separability helped improve the classification accuracy of strawberry guava. It enhanced the ability to distinguish between different levels of strawberry guava canopy cover. This improvement in separability contributed to achieving higher than 80% overall and individual class accuracies in the classification of strawberry guava using both Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods."
