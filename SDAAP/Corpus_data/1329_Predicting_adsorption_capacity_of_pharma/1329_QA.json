        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the adsorption capacity of PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) on microplastics is the total adsorption capacity (qe) measured in &mu;g/g (micrograms per gram). This metric quantifies the amount of PPCPs that can be adsorbed onto a given mass of microplastics.\n\nThe text states that the total adsorption capacity (qe) of 66 PPCPs on 15 original microplastics was in the range of 171.8 - 1043.7 &mu;g/g. However, the adsorption capacity of long-term aged microplastics was much higher, ranging from 7114.0 - 13,114.4 &mu;g/g.\n\nThe text also mentions that around 69.8% of the total adsorption capacity (qe) was primarily influenced by the total energy, energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital, and energy gap of the PPCPs. These factors were calculated using the B3LYP/6-31 G* level.\n\nIn terms of predicting adsorption behavior, the text describes the development of predictive models based on attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These models, including the maximal information coefficient and gradient boosting"

The researchers developed predictive models based on attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These models included the maximal information coefficient and gradient boosting decision tree regression.\n\nThe models were trained using spectroscopic data from 192 microplastics, and they were used to predict the individual and total adsorption capacity (qe) of the PPCPs on the microplastics. The models exhibited high accuracy, with Rtraining 2 values of 0.9772 and 0.9661 for the two different techniques, respectively. The p-values for the models were below 0.001, indicating their statistical significance.\n\nThe spectroscopic analysis and machine learning models provided insights into the adsorption process. They highlighted the alterations in surface functional groups and emphasized the importance of the 1528-1700 cm-1 spectral region and carbon skeleton in the adsorption mechanism.\n\nOverall, the utilization of machine learning techniques allowed for accurate prediction and analysis of the adsorption mechanism of PPCPs on microplastics, considering different treatments and long-term aging effects."
