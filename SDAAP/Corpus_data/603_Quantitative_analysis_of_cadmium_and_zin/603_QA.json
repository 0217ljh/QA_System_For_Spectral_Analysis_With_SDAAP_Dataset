        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in the related study is the RPD (Residual Predictive Deviation) value. The RPD value is a measure of the ratio between the standard deviation of the reference values and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). It indicates the ability of the model to accurately predict the content of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in algal pellets.\n\nThe RPD value can range from 1 to infinity, with higher values indicating better predictive performance. In the related study, the RPD values obtained for Cd and Zn analysis ranged from 6.44 to 13.27 and 7.87, respectively. These values suggest that the models have a good predictive ability and can accurately quantify the Cd and Zn contents in algae and the aquatic environment.\n\nOverall, the RPD metric provides a quantitative measure of the accuracy and reliability of the models in predicting the Cd and Zn contents. The higher the RPD value, the more robust and effective the model is in detecting and quantifying these heavy metals."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the analysis of Cd and Zn contents in algal pellets using LIBS technology, two machine learning models were utilized: partial least squares (PLS) regression and extreme learning machine (ELM). These models were constructed after spectral preprocessing using standard normal variate transformation (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and Savitzky-Golay smoothing (SG).\n\nFor univariate analysis, ELM models were developed based on specific wavelengths for Cd and Zn content prediction. The ELM model for Cd utilized the Cd II 226.45 nm wavelength of SNV preprocessed spectra, while the ELM model for Zn utilized the Zn II 206.19 nm wavelength of SNV preprocessed spectra. These models achieved the best results for Cd and Zn content prediction, with high R-p (correlation coefficient), RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction), and RPD (residual predictive deviation) values.\n\nIn multivariate analysis, the PLS model with global spectra was used for Cd detection. This model achieved the best performance with high R-c (correlation coefficient) and R-p values, low RMSECV (root mean square error of cross-validation) and RMSEP values, and a high RPD value.
