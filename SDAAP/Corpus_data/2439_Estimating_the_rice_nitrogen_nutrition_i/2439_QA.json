        "input": "",
        "Output": "The logarithmic difference transformation of the spectrum in the related study contributes to improving the estimation accuracy of the NNI estimation model in several ways. \n\nFirstly, the study found that simple logarithmic or difference transformation had little effect on NNI estimation. However, when the logarithmic difference transformation was applied, it effectively improved the NNI estimation results. This suggests that the logarithmic difference transformation enhances the ability of the model to accurately estimate the NNI.\n\nSecondly, the estimation model based on the logarithmic difference spectrum and Bald Eagle Search-Extreme Learning Machine (BES-ELM) had the highest estimation accuracy. The coefficient of determination (R2) values of the training set and verification set were 0.839 and 0.837, respectively. Additionally, the root mean square error (RMSE) values were 0.075 and 0.073, respectively. These results indicate that the logarithmic difference transformation contributes to improving the accuracy of the NNI estimation model.\n\nOverall, the logarithmic difference transformation of the spectrum effectively improves the estimation accuracy of the NNI estimation model in this study. It enhances the model's ability to accurately estimate the NNI and provides a new approach for improving NNI estimation methods based on hyperspectral technology."
