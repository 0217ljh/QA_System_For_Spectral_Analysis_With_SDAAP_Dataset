        "Output": "The different types of satellite data used to assess the accuracy of the classification model for peatland restoration monitoring in northern Scotland were:\n\n1. Sentinel-2 satellite data: This data was used to create one version of the model. It was compared against sub-metre resolution aerial imagery to evaluate the accuracy obtainable from both sources.\n\n2. Sub-metre resolution aerial imagery from GetMapping: This data was used to create another version of the model. It was compared against Sentinel-2 satellite data to assess the accuracy of prediction.\n\nAdditionally, in a further study, multiple years of satellite data (2015-2021) were used, including Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, to confirm the findings obtained with a single climatically average year and to examine the efficacy of different restoration methods."
