        "Output": "The researchers compared the prediction performance of three types of NIR spectra (equatorial surface spectra, distal end surface spectra, and juice spectra) in determining the internal quality parameters of Newhall navel oranges using machine learning methods. They systematically investigated each stage of the approach and obtained a much larger sample set than previous studies to ensure credibility and robustness. The prediction performance of the three types of spectra was evaluated and compared. The researchers found that all three types of spectra yielded promising results for quality measurements, with the equatorial surface spectra performing slightly but consistently better than the distal end spectra. However, the juice spectra performed best in predicting most internal quality parameters, except for the vitamin C content, where the surface spectra performed better. This indicated that the prediction with NIRS might result from indirect factors."
