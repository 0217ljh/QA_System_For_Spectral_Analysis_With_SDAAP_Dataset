        "Output": "The performance results of the three prediction approaches in developing DMI prediction models based on milk MIRS data were as follows:\n\n1. Partial least-squares regression: This method proved to be the best approach for predicting DMI from milk MIRS data. The prediction accuracy, as measured by R-2 (coefficient of determination), ranged from 0.07 to 0.40 when using the full milk MIRS alone. However, when additional variables were added to the model, the R-2 improved and the prediction error decreased.\n\n2. Support vector machine regression: The performance of support vector machine regression in predicting DMI from milk MIRS data was not explicitly mentioned in the text. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific performance results for this approach.\n\n3. Random forest regression: The performance of random forest regression in predicting DMI from milk MIRS data was also not explicitly mentioned in the text. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific performance results for this approach."

        "Output": "Based on the findings of the related research, the use of milk mid-infrared spectra (MIRS) as a spectral feature processing method cannot be considered superior to traditional methods in developing dry matter intake (DMI) prediction models. The research compared three different approaches for developing DMI prediction models based on MIRS data and found that the full milk MIRS alone provided low to moderate prediction accuracy. However, when additional variables such as milk yield and concentrate DMI were included in the model, regardless of the prediction tool used, good prediction accuracy was achieved. Therefore, the inclusion of additional variables rather than relying solely on MIRS data proved to be more effective in predicting DMI."
