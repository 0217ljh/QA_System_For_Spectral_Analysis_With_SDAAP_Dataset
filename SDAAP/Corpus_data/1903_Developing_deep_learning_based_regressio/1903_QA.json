        "Output": "Yes,based on the results of the related study, near-infrared hyper-spectral imaging (NIR-HSI) can be considered as superior to conventional methods for determining the chemical compositions in black goji berries. The study found that deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep autoencoder, used as modelling and feature extraction methods, obtained good and equivalent performances compared to the conventional methods. This suggests that NIR-HSI, combined with deep learning approaches, has great potential for accurately determining the chemical compositions in black goji berries."
