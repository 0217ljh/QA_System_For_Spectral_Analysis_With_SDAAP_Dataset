        "Output": "Yes, the combination of 1st derivative + gap and random forest (RF) can be considered superior to traditional methods for predicting soil organic matter (SOM) and other soil properties using absorbance spectra collected in the visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) region. The related study found that these preprocessing and modeling algorithms resulted in confident predictions (R-2 > 0.60) for SOM, pH, %sand, %silt, and %coarse sand (%CS). Additionally, the combination of 1st derivative + gap and RF was identified as the best performing combination for predicting SOM. Therefore, it can be concluded that this combination is superior to traditional methods for predicting soil properties using VIS-NIR spectroscopy."
