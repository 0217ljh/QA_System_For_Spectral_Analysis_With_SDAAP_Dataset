        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the inversion accuracy and precision in the grade inversion of Deerni copper ore bodies using hyperspectral data is R-2. The R-2 value, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (copper grade in this case) that can be explained by the independent variables (hyperspectral data). \n\nThe R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the model and the data. In the related study, the highest modeling precision achieved was an R-2 value of 0.950. This means that approximately 95% of the variance in the copper grade can be explained by the hyperspectral data and the inversion model. \n\nIt is important to note that while an R-2 value of 0.950 indicates a high level of accuracy and precision in the grade inversion, there is still a small amount of unexplained variance. Therefore, there is room for further improvement in the model, but the achieved R-2 value demonstrates a strong correlation between the hyperspectral data and the copper grade in the Deerni ore bodies."
