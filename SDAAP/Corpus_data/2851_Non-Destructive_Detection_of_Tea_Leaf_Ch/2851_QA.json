        "Output": "The results showed that the kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) performed the best in estimating chlorophyll content in tea leaves cultivated under different shade treatments. It had a root-mean-square error of 8.94 +/- 3.05 mu g cm(-2) and performance to deviation values ranging from 1.70 to 8.04 for the test data. This suggests that a combination of hyperspectral reflectance and KELM has the potential to trace changes in the chlorophyll content of shaded tea leaves."
