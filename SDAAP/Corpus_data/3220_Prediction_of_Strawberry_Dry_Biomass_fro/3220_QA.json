        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the regression techniques employed in the biomass modeling was R-2 (R-squared). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (strawberry dry biomass weight) that can be explained by the independent variables (canopy geometric parameters and spectral variables). \n\nThe paper states that the artificial neural network (ANN) had the highest accuracy in a five-fold cross-validation, with R-2 values ranging from 0.89 to 0.93. This indicates that the ANN model was able to explain 89% to 93% of the variance in strawberry dry biomass weight using the given independent variables. \n\nThe other five models (MLR, RF, SVM, MARS, and XGBoost) had lower R-2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.80."

        "Output": "Yes, the addition of vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from UAV multispectral imagery can improve the accuracy of biomass modeling when combined with canopy geometric parameters and machine learning models. The related study found that the inclusion of VIs increased the R-2 (coefficient of determination) from 0.77-0.80 to 0.83-0.86, reduced the RMSE (root mean square error) from 8.89-9.58 to 7.35-8.09 g, and decreased the MAE (mean absolute error) from 6.30-6.70 to 5.25-5.47 g. This indicates that the VIs provided additional information that improved the accuracy of biomass estimation. Specifically, red-edge-related VIs such as the normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), simple ratio vegetation index red-edge (SRRedEdge), modified simple ratio red-edge (MSRRedEdge), and chlorophyll index red and red-edge (CIred&RE) were identified as the most influential VIs for biomass modeling. Therefore, the combination of canopy geometric parameters and VIs obtained from UAV imagery was found to be effective for estimating strawberry dry biomass using machine learning models."
