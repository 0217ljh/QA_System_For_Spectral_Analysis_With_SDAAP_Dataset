        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting the establishment year of rubber plantations was the F1 score. In the study, the model achieved an accuracy of 84.4% for lowland modelling datasets and 84.7% for highland modelling datasets. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted establishment year was 0.83 years at the plantation scale."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The process for optimizing hyperparameters in the decision tree Machine Learning (ML) algorithm used in the study involved a repeated training and cross-validation assessment. The training model was repeated 30 times, and during each repetition, the hyperparameters were adjusted to find the best performance. The appropriateness of the hyperparameters was evaluated based on the F1 score. The hyperparameter that resulted in the highest F1 score was selected as the optimized hyperparameter for the decision tree ML algorithm."

        "Output": "The accuracy of the RP model using only the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profile is 84.4% for lowland modelling datasets and 84.7% for highland modelling datasets. This indicates that the RP model with NDVI profile performs well in identifying the ages of rubber plantations in Thalang district, Phuket province, southern Thailand. However, the comparison to traditional methods is not provided in the given related study, so we cannot determine how the accuracy of the RP model using NDVI profile compares to traditional methods."
