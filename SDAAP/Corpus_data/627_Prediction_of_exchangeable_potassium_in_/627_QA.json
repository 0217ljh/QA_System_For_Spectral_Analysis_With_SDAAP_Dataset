The R-squared value measures the proportion of the variance in the Kex content that can be explained by the model. In the related study, the implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.79, indicating that 79% of the variance in Kex can be explained by the model."

        "Output": "The significance of using the GradientShap algorithm in identifying important spectral regions for predicting exchangeable potassium (Kex) content in soil using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is two-fold.\n\nFirstly, the GradientShap algorithm helps provide interpretive keys to end-users. By identifying the spectral regions considered important by the CNN model for predicting Kex, the algorithm allows users to understand which specific features in the soil spectral data are most relevant for accurate predictions. This information can be valuable for researchers, agronomists, and farmers who need to optimize remediation strategies for radiocaesium contamination in agriculture. By knowing the important spectral regions, they can focus on collecting and analyzing data from those regions to improve the accuracy of Kex predictions.\n\nSecondly, the GradientShap algorithm demonstrates the benefit of including all Soil Taxonomy Orders in CNN-based modeling. By using the algorithm in the context of the implemented CNN on various Soil Taxonomy Orders, the related study shows that the spectral features learned by the model can be reused across different orders. This means that the CNN model can effectively predict Kex in soil samples from different orders, even if some orders are underrepresented in the training data. This finding highlights the versatility and generalizability of the CNN model, making it"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a large Mid-Infrared (MIR) soil spectral library can be considered superior to traditional methods for determining the exchangeable potassium (Kex) content in soil for optimizing remediation of radiocaesium contamination in agriculture. The related study states that the implemented CNN model leads to a significantly higher prediction performance of Kex compared to the baseline method of Partial Least Squares Regression. The CNN model increases the coefficient of determination from 0.64 to 0.79 and reduces the Mean Absolute Percentage Error from 135% to 31% when a large amount of data (10,000 samples) is available. This indicates that the CNN model provides more accurate predictions of Kex content in soil."
