The results showed that the support vector machine (SVM) model and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model achieved high accuracies. The model accuracies based on SVM ranged from 98.73% to 99.04%, while the PLS-DA model accuracies ranged from 98.73% to 99.68%.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In their research, the researchers compared the modeling results of FT-NIR spectra with different data matrices by using different chemometric methods and machine learning techniques. They combined the FT-NIR spectra into four data matrices and applied multiple pretreatment combinations to process these matrices. They then evaluated the model accuracies based on support vector machine and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) under the best preprocessing method. By comparing the modeling results of FT-NIR spectra with different data matrices, they found that the PLS-DA model based on low-level data fusion had the highest accuracy (99.68%). However, the residual neural network (ResNet) model based on the stipe, cap, and average spectral data matrix achieved even better accuracy (100%). This comparison allowed the researchers to determine that distinct models should be selected for different spectral data matrices of porcini mushrooms."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectral information combined with chemometric methods and machine learning can be considered superior to traditional methods for accurately evaluating and identifying different species of porcini mushrooms in the research. The research findings indicate that the model accuracies based on support vector machine and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) using FT-NIR spectra combined with chemometric methods were between 98.73% and 99.68%. This suggests that the combination of FT-NIR spectral information and advanced analytical techniques can provide highly accurate results in identifying different species of porcini mushrooms. Additionally, the advantages of FT-NIR spectra, such as being nondestructive and fast, make this method a promising analytical tool in food safety control."
