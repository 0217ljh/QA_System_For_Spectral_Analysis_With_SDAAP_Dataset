        "Output": "Yes, according to the related study, novelty detection classifiers using multispectral UAV imagery were able to effectively map the presence of Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. weed. The study employed a multispectral camera on a fixed wing UAV to obtain high-resolution images. Four novelty detection classifiers, including One Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), One Class Self-Organizing Maps (OC-SOM), Autoencoders, and One Class Principal Component Analysis (OC-PCA), were used to identify S. marianum among other vegetation in a field. The input features for these classifiers included the three spectral bands and texture. The study reported that the OC-SVM classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 96% in identifying S. marianum. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using novelty detection classifiers with multispectral UAV imagery for effective mapping of S. marianum weed."
