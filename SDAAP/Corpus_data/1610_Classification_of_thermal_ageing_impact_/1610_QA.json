Additionally, the plasma temperature can be evaluated using OES, which helps in understanding the effects of different voltages on the material.\n\nFurthermore, the use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) with machine-learning algorithms allows for the classification of the ageing of the material. The intensity ratio and electron density obtained from LIBS studies correlate well with the plasma temperature, indicating the effectiveness of this technique in evaluating the material's ageing.\n\nThe machine-learning techniques, specifically the artificial neural network algorithm, provide better classification accuracy for all the aged samples compared to traditional methods like principal component analysis. This suggests that the combination of LIBS and machine-learning algorithms offers superior performance evaluation capabilities for the thermal ageing of ester fluid-impregnated pressboard material."
