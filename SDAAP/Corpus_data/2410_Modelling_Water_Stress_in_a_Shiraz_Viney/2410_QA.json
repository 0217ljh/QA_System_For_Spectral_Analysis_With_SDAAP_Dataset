        "Output": "The two ensemble learners, random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were applied to analyze the hyperspectral data in discriminating stressed and non-stressed Shiraz vines using terrestrial hyperspectral imaging. The study used a total of 176 wavebands for analysis. RF produced a test accuracy of 83.3% (KHAT = 0.67), while XGBoost produced a test accuracy of 80.0% (KHAT = 0.6) when using all wavebands. Additionally, a subset of 18 wavebands, derived using RF mean decrease accuracy (MDA) and XGBoost gain, was also evaluated. This subset of wavebands resulted in slight increases in accuracy ranging from 1.7% to 5.5% for both RF and XGBoost."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of terrestrial hyperspectral imagery and machine learning can provide a semi-automated framework for vineyard water stress modeling. The study applied two ensemble learners, random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), to discriminate stressed and non-stressed Shiraz vines using terrestrial hyperspectral imaging. The results showed that both ensemble learners were able to effectively analyze the hyperspectral data and achieve high test accuracies."
