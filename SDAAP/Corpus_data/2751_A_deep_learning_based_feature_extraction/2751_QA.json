        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to predict the TVB-N content in Pacific white shrimp was the R-p(2) value. The R-p(2) value is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model and indicates the proportion of the variance in the TVB-N content that can be explained by the model. In the related study, the best prediction model, SAEs-LS-SVM, had an R-p(2) value of 0.921. This indicates that the model was able to explain approximately 92.1% of the variance in the TVB-N content. Therefore, the chosen metric performed well in predicting TVB-N content."
