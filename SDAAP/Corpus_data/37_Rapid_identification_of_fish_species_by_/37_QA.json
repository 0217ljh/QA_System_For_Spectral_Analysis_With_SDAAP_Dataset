        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the effectiveness of different data fusion strategies in improving classification accuracy for fish species identification using LIBS and Raman spectroscopy by comparing the results with the individual LIBS or Raman data. They used two machine learning methods, SVM and CNN, to establish classification models based on the LIBS and Raman data obtained from 13 types of fish species. They then applied data fusion strategies, including low-level, mid-level, and high-level fusions, to combine the LIBS and Raman data. The researchers found that all of these data fusion strategies offered a significant improvement in fish classification compared to using the individual LIBS or Raman data alone. Additionally, they observed that the CNN model worked more powerfully than the SVM model. The low-level fusion CNN model provided the best classification accuracy of 98.2%, while the mid-level fusion, which involved feature selection, improved computing efficiency and gained interpretability of the CNN model."
