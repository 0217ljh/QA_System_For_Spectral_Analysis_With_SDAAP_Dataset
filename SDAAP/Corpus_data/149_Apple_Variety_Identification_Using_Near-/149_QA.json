        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the modelswas identification accuracy. The past study reported that the SPA-ELM model achieved an identification accuracy of 98.33% on the calibration set and 96.67% on the prediction set. Therefore, the identification accuracy metric reached a maximum accuracy of 98.33% in terms of distinguishing apple variety and geographical origin using NIR spectroscopy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The experimental results of this study suggest that the ELM models performed better than the BPNN and SVM models in identifying apple variety and geographical origin using NIR spectroscopy. However, this does not necessarily imply that spectroscopic methods are superior to traditional methods in this context. \n\nThe past study only compared the performance of different pattern recognition methods using NIR spectroscopy, and it does not provide any direct comparison or evaluation of traditional methods. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that spectroscopic methods are superior to traditional methods based solely on the results of this study."
