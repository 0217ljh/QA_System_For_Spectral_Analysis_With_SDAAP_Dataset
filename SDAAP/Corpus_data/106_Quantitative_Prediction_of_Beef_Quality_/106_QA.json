        "Output": "Past study investigated the influence of animal gender on beef quality prediction using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) by evaluating the performance of these techniques on a large dataset acquired under industrial conditions. The dataset consisted of 234 beef M. longissimus thoracis steaks from heifers, steers, and young bulls. The spectral dataset was collected using visible and near infrared (VISNIR) spectroscopy with a wavelength range of 350 to 1800 nm. \n\nTo handle the high dimensionality of the VISNIR data (over 1600 spectral bands), the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was applied for feature extraction and data reduction. The extracted principal components (less than 100) were then used for data modeling and prediction.\n\nThe prediction results showed that SVM had a greater potential to predict beef eating quality than PLSR, especially for the prediction of tenderness. Additionally, the study investigated the influence of animal gender on beef quality prediction. It was found that beef quality traits were predicted most accurately in beef from young bulls."

        "Output": "Spectroscopic methods, specifically Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were evaluated for their effectiveness in analyzing meat tenderness and predicting beef eating quality. The results of past study suggest that SVM has a greater potential to predict beef eating quality, particularly in terms of tenderness, compared to PLSR. Therefore, spectroscopic methods, specifically SVM, can be considered superior to traditional methods for analyzing meat tenderness and predicting beef eating quality."
