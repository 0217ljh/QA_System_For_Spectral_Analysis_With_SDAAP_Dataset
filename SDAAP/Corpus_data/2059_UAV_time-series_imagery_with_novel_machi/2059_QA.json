        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction models in the study was the coefficient of determination (R2). The R2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the predicted values that can be explained by the model. In this study, the R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.78, indicating that the models could explain 60% to 78% of the variance in the predicted values. This metric provides a measure of how well the models can predict the IHD and FHD of rice accessions based on the canopy reflectance extracted from multispectral images."

        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, the Res2Net50 model used in the study showed promising results in classifying growth stages and predicting the days from sowing to initial heading (IHD) and days from sowing to full heading (FHD) of rice accessions. The model successfully identified five growth stages with overall accuracies of 86% and 83% in two different locations. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) models developed using the Res2Net50 classification achieved good performances in predicting IHD and FHD, with coefficient of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.60 to 0.78 and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 3.9 days to 5.1 days. The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) varied between 4% to 6%. \n\nFurthermore, the proposed method was validated with ten cultivars and achieved a rRMSE of 3%-4%, which was comparable to field inspection. The feasibility of the proposed method in monitoring the rice heading dynamics was also validated using model transfer in EXP 2. \n\nBased on these results, it can be inferred that the Res2Net50 model, along with the PLSR models developed using its"
