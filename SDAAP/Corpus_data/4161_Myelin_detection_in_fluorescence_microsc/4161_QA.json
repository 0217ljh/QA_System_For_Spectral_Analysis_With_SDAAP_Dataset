This accuracy value was one of the highest among the 23 different supervised machine learning techniques that were assessed.\n\nTherefore, the customized-CNN showed promising results and performed well in detecting myelin in the fluorescence microscopy images. It can be considered as a feasible and robust method for remyelination drug screening in the context of MS drug discovery."

The research only mentions the development of this approach specifically for myelin detection in fluorescence microscopy images. Therefore, it is unclear whether this approach can be directly applied to other spectroscopic methods for drug discovery in MS. Further research and experimentation would be needed to determine the applicability of this approach to other spectroscopic methods."
