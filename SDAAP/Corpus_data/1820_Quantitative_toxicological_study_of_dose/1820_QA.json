        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the developed dual-modality measurement and quantitative analysis method can be used to assess the risk of arsenic contamination and metabolism in the study. The method combines synchrotron-radiation-based scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy (SR-STXM) and Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy (SR-FTIR) techniques to evaluate various dose-dependent iAs-related cytotoxicological manifestations. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based machine learning is employed on SR-STXM data to quantify cytomorphological feature changes and dose-dependent iAs-induced feature classifications. The SR-FTIR technique is used to obtain infrared spectral absorption peaks and changes in dose-dependent iAs-induced cells, which are then classified using the multi-spectral-variate principle component analysis (PCA-LDA) method. This method provides the morphological and spectral characteristics evolution of iAs-related cells or particles, allowing for the assessment of the actual risk of arsenic contamination and metabolism."
