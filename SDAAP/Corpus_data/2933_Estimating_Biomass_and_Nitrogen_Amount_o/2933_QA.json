        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the estimation accuracy for estimating crop biomass and nitrogen content was the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE%). The PCC measures the linear relationship between the estimated values and the reference measurements, with a value ranging from -1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while a value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. The RMSE% measures the average difference between the estimated values and the reference measurements, expressed as a percentage of the reference measurements."

        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were utilized to estimate crop biomass and nitrogen content using remote sensing techniques with drones and aircrafts. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used as the estimator for this purpose. The RF algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. It is capable of handling both numerical and categorical data and is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional datasets.\n\nThe RF algorithm was trained using spectral and 3D features extracted from the airborne miniaturized multispectral, hyperspectral, and RGB cameras. These features were obtained from the data captured by the cameras onboard the drone and aircraft. The spectral features were derived from the hyperspectral camera based on the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI), while the RGB features were obtained from the regular RGB camera.\n\nTo validate the consistency of the RF results, Simple Linear Regression (SLR) was also used. SLR is a statistical technique that establishes a linear relationship between the independent variables (spectral and 3D features) and the dependent variables (crop biomass and nitrogen content). It helps in assessing the accuracy and reliability of the RF predictions."
