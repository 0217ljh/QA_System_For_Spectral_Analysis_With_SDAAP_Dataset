The classification accuracies for select strains from blood agar were 0.7826, 0.8696, and 0.9565 at the genus, species, and strain levels, respectively. When using the FT-IR data from three different culture media for cross-validation, the accuracy at the strain level was 0.3681."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of FT-IR with multivariate analysis can be considered a superior method for the rapid classification of E. coli and Shigella compared to traditional analytical methods. The related study states that FT-IR shows great potential in the classification of bacteria with high specificity and low cost. The study evaluated the efficiency of this technique when combined with multivariate analysis and found that it was able to classify E. coli and Shigella strains with high accuracy at the genus, species, and strain levels. This indicates that FT-IR combined with multivariate analysis is more reliable and effective in bacterial classification compared to traditional methods."
