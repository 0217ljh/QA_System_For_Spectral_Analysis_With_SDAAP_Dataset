The Cubist method had the highest performance in predicting soil organic matter (SOM) with an R-2 value of 0.64 and an RMSE of 1.95. The Random Forest (RF) approach showed the highest performance in predicting pH H2O with an R-2 value of 0.49 and an RMSE of 0.45, and in predicting pH KCl with an R-2 value of 0.44 and an RMSE of 0.61."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models in the rlated study in predicting SOM and pH were calibrated and validated using the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. This approach involves training the models on a subset of the data and then testing their performance on the remaining data points. The process is repeated multiple times, each time leaving out one data point for testing and using the rest for training. This allows for an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance and helps to assess its ability to generalize to new data. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used as metrics to determine the performance of the machine learning models in predicting soil organic matter (SOM) and pH."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the Cubist method and Random Forest approach can be considered superior to traditional methods in predicting soil organic matter (SOM) and pH in the foothills of the Ural Mountains in Russia using digital mapping and environmental variables. According to the study, these machine learning techniques showed the highest performance in predicting SOM and pH compared to other methods. The Cubist method resulted in the most accurate spatial prediction for SOM, while the Random Forest approach showed the highest performance in predicting pH H2O and KCl. These ML models were calibrated and validated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, and their performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) metrics. Therefore, based on the results of this study, the Cubist method and Random Forest approach can be considered superior to traditional methods for predicting SOM and pH in this specific region using digital mapping and environmental variables."
