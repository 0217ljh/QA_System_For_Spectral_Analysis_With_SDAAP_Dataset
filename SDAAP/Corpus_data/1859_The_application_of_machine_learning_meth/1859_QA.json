The highest average classification score achieved was 67.73% for Logistic regression and 55.38% for Random Forest, based on 10-fold cross-validation testing. \n\nAs for how far this metric can go, the text suggests that there is scope to enhance these classification scores to an accuracy of 100% by combining the geochemical datasets together. However, it also mentions the difficulty in linking different analytical techniques and datasets, which may affect the accuracy of the classification. Therefore, it is unclear how far the metric can go in achieving perfect accuracy without further improvements and considerations."
