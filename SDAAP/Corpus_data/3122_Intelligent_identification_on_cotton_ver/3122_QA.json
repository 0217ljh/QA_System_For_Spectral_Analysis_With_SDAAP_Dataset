        "Output": "In the related study on cotton verticillium wilt identification based on spectral and image feature fusion, the classification models were built using two machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation neural network (BPNN).\n\nFor the spectral feature processing, the preprocessing methods used were Savitzky-Golay smoothing (SG), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), de-trending (DT), and mean normalization (MN) algorithms. The feature band extraction methods used were principal component analysis (PCA) and successive projections algorithm (SPA).\n\nFor the RGB image feature processing, the EfficientNet model was applied to build the classification model. From the last convolutional layer of the EfficientNet model, 16 image features were extracted.\n\nThe obtained spectral and image features were then fused, and the classification models were established using SVM and BPNN algorithms.\n\nOverall, the specific machine learning algorithms used in this study were SVM and BPNN for building the classification models based on the fused spectral and image features."
