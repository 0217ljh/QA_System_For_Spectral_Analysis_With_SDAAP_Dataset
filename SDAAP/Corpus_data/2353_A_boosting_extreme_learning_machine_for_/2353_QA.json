        "input": "",
        "Output": "The boosting ELM approach is a quantitative model that aims to improve the predictive accuracy and stability of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) in the analysis of complex samples. It involves building a large number of ELM sub-models sequentially by selecting a certain number of samples from the original training set based on the distribution of sampling weights. \n\nThe predictions of these ELM sub-models are then aggregated using the weighted median. This aggregation process helps to reduce the instability and increase the accuracy of the predictions. \n\nIn addition, the boosting ELM approach determines the activation function and the number of hidden nodes of the ELM sub-models simultaneously using the ratio of the mean value and standard deviation of correlation coefficients (MSR). This ensures that the sub-models are optimized for the specific dataset, further improving the accuracy and stability of the overall model.\n\nThe boosting ELM approach has been tested with diesel fuel and blended edible oil samples and compared with other methods such as partial least squares (PLS) and traditional ELMs. The results demonstrate that the boosting ELM approach is an efficient ensemble model that outperforms these other methods in terms of predictive accuracy and stability. Therefore, it is considered as a promising alternative for near-infrared (NIR) spectral quantitative analysis of complex"
