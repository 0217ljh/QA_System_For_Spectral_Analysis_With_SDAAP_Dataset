Based on the information provided in the related study, the use of VNIR spectral reflectance data for estimating crop canopy nitrogen concentration (CNC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) can be considered superior to traditional methods in precision agriculture. The related study mentions that VNIR spectral response has been widely used to estimate CNC and AGB of canopies. Additionally, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, such as partial least squares regression (PLSR) and convolutional neural network (CNN), have emerged as promising approaches for mapping CNC and AGB using VNIR spectral reflectance. These models showed good performance in predicting CNC and AGB in the test data. Furthermore, the VNIR spectral reflectance data was found to be informative for CNC and AGB models."
