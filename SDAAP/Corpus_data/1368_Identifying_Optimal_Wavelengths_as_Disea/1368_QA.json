        "Output": "Yes, the identified wavelengths using in-situ spectroscopy and machine learning can be used in the related research to develop optical sensors for automated stem rot detection in peanut fields. The study found that wavelengths of 501-505, 690-694, 763, and 884 nm were repeatedly selected by two or more feature selection methods as the most important wavelengths for discriminating between healthy and diseased peanut plants infected with Athelia rolfsii. These selected wavelengths can be applied in designing optical sensors that can detect stem rot in peanut fields automatically."
