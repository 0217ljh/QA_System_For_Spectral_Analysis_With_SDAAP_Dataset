        "Output": "The goal of the KarMeN (Karlsruhe Metabolomics and Nutrition) study was to investigate how sex and age-related physiological conditions are reflected in the metabolome of healthy humans and whether sex and age can be predicted based on the plasma and urine metabolite profiles."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, the blood and urine samples were analyzed using targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches. These approaches included mass spectrometry coupled to one- or comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography or liquid chromatography, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These techniques allowed for the identification and measurement of over 400 analytes in plasma and over 500 analytes in urine."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, spectroscopic methods, specifically mass spectrometry coupled to one- or comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography or liquid chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were used in the KarMeN study to analyze plasma and urine samples from healthy humans. These methods allowed for the identification of metabolite patterns that could accurately classify participants according to sex with over 90% accuracy. Additionally, metabolite profiles were able to predict age for both men and women separately. Therefore, spectroscopic methods can be used to accurately predict sex and age based on plasma and urine metabolite profiles in healthy humans, as demonstrated in the KarMeN study."
