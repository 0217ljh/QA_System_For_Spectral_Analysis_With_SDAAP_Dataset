        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the efficiency of visible and near-infrared (VIS/NIR) sensors and predictive modeling can be used to detect and classify South American Leaf Blight (SALB) in rubber trees and predict disease-induced photosynthetic changes. The study used leaf hyperspectral reflectance combined with five machine learning (ML) techniques (random forest, boosted regression tree, bagged classification and regression trees, artificial neural network, and support vector machine) to detect and classify SALB levels with high accuracies. Additionally, the ML models were able to predict leaf gas exchange-related traits such as net CO2 assimilation rate and extrinsic water use efficiency with high accuracy. This research provides a basis for future designs of a remote monitoring system for early detection and accurate diagnosis of SALB, which is crucial for effective rubber crop protection."
