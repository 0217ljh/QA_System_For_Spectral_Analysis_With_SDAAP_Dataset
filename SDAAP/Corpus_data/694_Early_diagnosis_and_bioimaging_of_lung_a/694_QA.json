        "Output": "In the related research on the early fast diagnosis and in vivo imaging method for lung adenocarcinoma, machine learning models were utilized to classify the collected spectral data from normal and patients' cells/tissues. Specifically, the support vector machine (SVM) classification model and the grid search method were used to select the optimal model parameters. The feature selection algorithm was also employed to select important wavelengths from the Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-vis absorbance, and fluorescence spectra data. These machine learning models were trained on a training set and evaluated on a test set to determine their accuracy. The optimal model achieved an accuracy of 96.89% on the training set and 88.57% on the test set. This model was then used to classify all samples, resulting in an overall accuracy of 94.37%. Additionally, an optimized algorithm was used for classification based on the intracellular absorbance and fluorescence data obtained using anthocyanin, achieving an accuracy of 91.38% on the training set and 80.77% on the test set. Overall, the utilization of machine learning models in the related research contributed to the accurate and effective diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma."
