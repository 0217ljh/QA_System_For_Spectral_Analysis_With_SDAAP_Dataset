They exhibited the best classification capability among the spectral feature processing methods used in the related study, with a mean correct classification rate of 95.97%. This indicates that the ELM models were able to accurately distinguish between bruised and non-bruised apples based on the hyperspectral images.\n\nIn comparison to other spectral feature processing methods, such as Partial Least Squares Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), the ELM models outperformed them in terms of classification capability. The ELM models achieved a higher correct classification rate, indicating their superior ability to accurately identify bruised apples.\n\nTherefore, based on the results of this study, the ELM models were the most effective in identifying bruised apples at different stages after bruising, surpassing other spectral feature processing methods in terms of classification capability."
