        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the detection results of rice IPCL in the study is the Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient for the qualitative model (SVM), and the R2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean square error) for the quantitative models (LSSVR, PSO-LSSVR, 1D-CNN). \n\nThe OA measures the percentage of correctly classified samples, while the Kappa coefficient measures the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of agreement by chance. \n\nThe R2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the IPCL that can be explained by the model, with a higher value indicating a better fit. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual IPCL values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy.\n\nThe study reports that the NL-SVM achieved an OA of 99.383% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.993, indicating a high level of accuracy and agreement in the qualitative detection of rice IPCL. The MAS-1D-CNN achieved an R2 of 0.964 and an RMSE of 0.033%, indicating a strong correlation and low prediction error in the quantitative detection of rice IPCL.\n\nTherefore,"

        "Output": "The researchers combined spectral pretreatment techniques with machine learning models to investigate the effects on the qualitative and quantitative models of rice industrial paraffin contamination levels (IPCL) by using various preprocessing methods such as Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC), Standard Normal Variate (SNV), Normalization (NL), Moving Average Smoothing (MAS), Savitzky-Golay Smoothing (S-G-S), First Derivative (FD), and Second Derivatives (SD) on the original spectral data. They then compared and analyzed the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The qualitative model (Support Vector Machine - SVM) and quantitative models (Least Squares Support Vector Regression - LSSVR, Particle Swarm Optimization-LSSVR - PSO-LSSVR, and 1D Convolutional Neural Network - 1D-CNN) were used to detect the rice IPCL."

        "Output": "Yes, the NL-SVM and MAS-1D-CNN models can be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting rice industrial paraffin contamination levels. The study showed that the NL-SVM model achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 99.383% and a Kappa value of 0.993, while the MAS-1D-CNN model achieved an R2 value of 0.964 and an RMSE value of 0.033%. These results indicate that both models have high accuracy and precision in detecting the contamination levels. Additionally, even after lightweight processing by the CARS algorithm, the NL-SVM and MAS-1D-CNN models still showed good detection results, with an OA of 97.531% and 97.531%, and a Kappa value of 0.970 and 0.970, respectively. Therefore, based on the results of this study, the NL-SVM and MAS-1D-CNN models can be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting rice industrial paraffin contamination levels."
