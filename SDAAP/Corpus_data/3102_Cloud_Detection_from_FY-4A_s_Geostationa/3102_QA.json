        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the cloud detection models is the Heidke skill score (HSS). The HSS measures the skill of a forecast or detection method by comparing it to a reference forecast or detection method. It takes into account both hits and correct rejections, as well as false alarms and misses. \n\nThe HSS can provide a good assessment of the accuracy of the cloud detection models, as it considers both the ability to correctly identify clouds (hits) and the ability to correctly identify non-clouds (correct rejections)."

The models using 689 channels as features achieved a Heidke skill score (HSS) of 0.780 on land and 0.945 at sea, with false alarm rates (FAR) of 16.6% on land and 4.7% at sea. The models using 38 channels had a slightly lower performance, with an HSS of 0.741 on land and 0.912 at sea, and FAR of 17.7% on land and 7.1% at sea.\n\nIn terms of time cost, the machine learning cloud detection method has a significant advantage over the traditional methods.
