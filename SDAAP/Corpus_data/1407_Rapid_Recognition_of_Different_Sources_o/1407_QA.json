According to the text, the prediction accuracy of the ML-ELM algorithm was 25.33%, 20.00%, and 17.33% higher than that of the LDA, SVM, and ELM algorithms, respectively, for 4 cases. Therefore, the ML-ELM algorithm showed higher accuracy compared to the other algorithms in identifying the sources of heroin drugs. However, the text does not provide information on how far this metric can go beyond the mentioned cases."

        "Output": "The ML-ELM algorithm combined with hand-held NIR technology is superior to traditional methods in rapidly and non-destructively identifying the sources of heroin drugs. According to the text, the ML-ELM algorithm had the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to traditional algorithms such as LDA, SVM, and ELM. The prediction accuracy of the ML-ELM algorithm was significantly higher than that of the other algorithms, with a 25.33%, 20.00%, and 17.33% improvement over LDA, SVM, and ELM, respectively. The ML-ELM models also demonstrated the best generalization ability and prediction results for recognizing the different sources of heroin drugs. Therefore, the combination of hand-held NIR technology and the ML-ELM algorithm allows for rapid, accurate, and non-destructive identification of the sources of heroin drugs on the spot."
