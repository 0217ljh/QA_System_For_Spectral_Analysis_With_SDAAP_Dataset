This metric was used to predict AGB primarily from lidar data, with an R-2 value of 0.8, RMSE of 115 Mg ha(-1), and a bias of 2 Mg ha(-1). This metric allowed for AGB estimation at a resolution of 30 m where lidar data were available."

        "Output": "The study's conclusion regarding the unbiased estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) using the prototype Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) contributes to the evaluation of spectroscopic methods compared to traditional methods in forest management and planning decisions by demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of the CMS in providing accurate AGB estimates. The CMS utilizes a combination of lidar metrics, Landsat image time series variables, climate metrics, and topographic metrics to estimate AGB at both landscape and regional scales. The use of machine-learning algorithm Random Forests (RF) further enhances the accuracy of the estimates.\n\nBy comparing the CMS estimates with field plot data collected by the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program, the study shows that the CMS estimates are unbiased and can be used to inform forest management and planning decisions. This suggests that spectroscopic methods, such as lidar and Landsat data, can provide reliable and unbiased AGB estimates, which can be crucial for making informed decisions related to forest management and planning.\n\nIn contrast to traditional methods, which may rely on manual measurements and subjective assessments, the CMS offers a more objective and efficient approach to estimating AGB."
