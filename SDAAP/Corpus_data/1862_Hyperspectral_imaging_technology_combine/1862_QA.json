        "Output": "The performance of the deep forests (DF) model was found to be better than the traditional classifier models (decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM)) in classifying rice seeds with different degrees of frost damage using hyperspectral imaging technology. The study showed that the DF model performed well even with small-scale sample sets, making it a suitable choice for classification in this context."
