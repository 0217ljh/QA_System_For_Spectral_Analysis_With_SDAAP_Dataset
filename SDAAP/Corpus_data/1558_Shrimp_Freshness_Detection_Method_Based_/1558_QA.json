        "input": "",
        "Output": "The specific metric that was chosen to evaluate the freshness discrimination performance in the study on shrimp freshness discrimination was classification accuracy. The classification accuracy of the broad learning system (BLS) was 97.14%, which is a high level of accuracy. Therefore, the experimental results suggest that the broad learning system is a more accurate method for shrimp freshness detection compared to traditional methods."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed shrimp freshness detection method based on a broad learning system can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy. The study compared the broad learning system (BLS) with classical discriminant models such as partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and extreme learning machine (ELM). The results indicated that the BLS had high accuracy and shorter discrimination time compared to these traditional methods. Additionally, the combined RF-BLS model obtained the best freshness discrimination performance. Therefore, the experimental results suggest that the broad learning system is a more accurate method for shrimp freshness detection compared to traditional methods."
