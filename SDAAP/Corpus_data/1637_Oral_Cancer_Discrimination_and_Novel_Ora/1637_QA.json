These spectra were selected to reflect intra-sample heterogeneity, resulting in a total of 46 representative spectra. \n\nThe PLSDA model achieved 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while both the SVM and XGBDA models generated 95% sensitivity and 96% specificity, respectively. These models were trained to classify the spectra based on their similarity to either HK or OSCC cases. \n\nOverall, the machine learning discriminant models were trained using the representative spectra from HK and OSCC samples to develop a potential risk stratification strategy for the precancerous OED (oral epithelial dysplasia) samples and aid in early oral cancer detection."

        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging technique shows promise in the detection and classification of oral hyperkeratosis (HK), oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) biopsy samples. The study used FTIR imaging in a transmission model to evaluate these oral conditions. The technique involved defining FTIR imaging areas in each sample section and generating representative spectra for the epithelial tissue in each area.\n\nExploratory analyses using Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis showed good separation between the HK and OSCC spectra, indicating that FTIR imaging can differentiate between these conditions. However, there were overlaps observed between OED spectra and either HK or OSCC spectra, suggesting that further analysis and classification are needed.\n\nMachine learning discriminant models based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), support vector machines discriminant analysis (SVMDA), and extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis (XGBDA) were trained using representative spectra from HK and OSCC samples. The PLSDA model achieved 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while both SVM and XGBDA models generated 95% sensitivity and 96% specificity, respectively.\n\nThese results suggest that the FT"
