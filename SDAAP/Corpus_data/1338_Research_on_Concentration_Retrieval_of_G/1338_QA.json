        "Output": "The purpose of the proposed novel quantitative analysis method of polluted gases, specifically focusing on the mixture of CO, CO2, and N2O gases, is to establish a concentration retrieval model that can effectively analyze and quantify the presence of these gases in the polluted environment. The method aims to select the best wavenumbers using interval dividing and optimize the connect weights and thresholds of the input and hidden layers of the extreme learning machine (ELM) using genetic algorithm. By doing so, the method aims to reduce modeling time, improve stability and predict accuracy, and provide an effective approach for remote analysis of polluted gases."

        "Output": "Yes, the proposed Interval-GA-ELM (iGELM) method can be used to achieve improved stability and predict accuracy in the quantitative analysis of polluted gases using FTIR spectroscopy, specifically for the mixture of CO, CO2, and N2O gases. The experiment results showed that the concentration retrieval model established with the selected wavenumbers using iGELM had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 154.9963 and a determined coefficient (r) of 0.9874. Additionally, the running time for the model was just 0.8 seconds. These results indicate that the iGELM method can reduce modeling time and improve stability and predict accuracy, especially in the presence of interferents. Therefore, it provides an effective approach to the remote analysis of polluted gases."
