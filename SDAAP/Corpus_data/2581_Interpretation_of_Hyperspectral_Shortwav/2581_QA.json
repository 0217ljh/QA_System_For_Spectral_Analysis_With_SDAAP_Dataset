        "input": "",
        "Output": "The automated method developed in the related study improves upon traditional analysis in terms of detecting minerals that are considered invisible. Traditional shortwave infrared hyperspectral analysis relies on identifying spectral features of minerals, which can limit the detection of certain minerals. However, the methodology presented in this study overcomes this limitation by using supervised machine learning techniques to process, mask, and extract mineralogical and textural information from hyperspectral data. This approach integrates hyperspectral data with quantitative scanning electron microscopy data, allowing for the detection of major felsic rock-forming minerals, including those that are considered invisible in traditional analysis."
