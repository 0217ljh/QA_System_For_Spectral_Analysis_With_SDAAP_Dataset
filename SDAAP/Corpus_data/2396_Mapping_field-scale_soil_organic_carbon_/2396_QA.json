        "Output": "The results of applying the regression models and machine learning algorithms in predicting SOC at the field scale using time series multispectral images were as follows:\n\n1. The spectral bands and vegetation indices showed strong relationships with SOC in different months.\n2. The ratios of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) for the different models were as follows: STR - 2.218, PLSR - 2.074, SVM - 2.168, BPNN - 2.546, and ELM - 2.380. This indicates that the BPNN model had the highest RPIQ and performed the best in predicting SOC.\n3. The spatial characteristics of SOC were observed both between and within fields. However, only the BPNN and ELM models were able to highlight the spatial heterogeneity of SOC within fields.\n\nOverall, the time series multispectral images provided valuable covariates and helped overcome the influence of surface vegetation in predicting SOC at the field scale. Additionally, the machine learning algorithms, particularly BPNN, were able to extract valuable information from complex variables and improve the accuracy of soil mapping."
