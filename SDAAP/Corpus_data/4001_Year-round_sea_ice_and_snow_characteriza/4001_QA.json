        "Output": "Pair-wise indices such as the spectral gradient ratio (GR) and polarization ratio (PR) were adopted to derive sea ice characteristics, including sea ice concentration and sea ice age. These methods were used to identify specific behaviors for sea ice concentration, sea ice thickness, and snow structure."

        "Output": "The metric chosen to identify specific behaviors for sea ice concentration, sea ice thickness, and snow structure is brightness temperature (TB). The metric can go as far as distinguishing sea ice from open water and observing changes in sea ice thickness based on TB values at different frequencies."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning technique contributes to the comprehensive characterization of sea ice and its snow cover by classifying sea ice microwave signatures in their spectral dimension. This classification is based on the unique dataset of passive microwave observations, which mimics the future Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR). By using machine learning, the CIMR database is able to identify specific behaviors and patterns in the microwave observations related to Sea Ice Concentration (SIC), Sea Ice Thickness (SIT), and snow structure.\n\nThe classification results obtained through the machine learning technique are then interpreted using a state-of-the-art sea ice and Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer model (SMRT). This model helps to explain the microwave observations and their co-variabilities for different seasons and highlighted signatures. It takes into account factors such as the presence of depth hoar over multi-year ice in winter and the presence of superimposed ice in late summer.\n\nOverall, the machine learning technique enhances the understanding and interpretation of the microwave observations by providing a systematic and data-driven approach to classify and analyze the sea ice and snow cover characteristics. This contributes to a more realistic and comprehensive characterization of sea ice and its snow cover using the radiative transfer model."
