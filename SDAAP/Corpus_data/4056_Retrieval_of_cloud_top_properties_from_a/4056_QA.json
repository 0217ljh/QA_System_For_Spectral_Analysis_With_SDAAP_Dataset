These ML algorithms utilize advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the spectral bands of the AHI data and extract information about cloud properties. This ML-based approach improves the accuracy of CTH retrieval, particularly for high and optically thin clouds.\n\nNext, the TRA algorithms are used to derive CTH from the CALIPSO measurements. These TRA algorithms utilize traditional physical principles and equations to estimate CTH based on the lidar and infrared measurements from CALIPSO. \n\nFinally, the joint algorithm combines the CTH estimates from both the ML and TRA algorithms. This combination is done in a way that reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) of CTH retrieval to 1.53 km and enhances the accuracy of layered clouds (CTH < 18 km). By combining the strengths of both ML and TRA algorithms, the joint algorithm provides a more accurate and reliable CTH estimation than either algorithm alone."

The mean absolute error (MAE) of CTH derived from the machine learning algorithms is reported to be between 1.54-2.72 km, whereas the MAE from the traditional physical algorithm is approximately 3.24 km based on CALIPSO data validation. This indicates that the machine learning algorithms reduce the error in CTH estimation, resulting in more accurate measurements.\n\nSecondly, the machine learning algorithms show particular improvements in high and optically thin clouds. These types of clouds are often challenging for traditional physical algorithms to accurately estimate CTH. However, the machine learning algorithms are able to overcome these challenges and provide more precise CTH measurements for such clouds.\n\nFurthermore, the study develops a joint algorithm that combines the optimal machine learning algorithms with the traditional physical algorithm. This combined approach further reduces the MAE to 1.53 km and enhances the accuracy of layered CTH (CTH < 18 km)."
