        "Output": "The fusion algorithm of moth-flame optimization and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) was used in the multiclassification learning model to identify edible oils by combining the strengths of both algorithms. \n\nFirst, the fluorescence spectrum data of oil samples were obtained using the laser induction fluorescence (LIF) technique. Principal component analysis was then used to extract characteristic information from the fluorescence spectra.\n\nNext, the fusion algorithm of moth-flame optimization and KELM was applied to develop the multiclassification learning model. The moth-flame optimization algorithm was used to optimize the parameters of the KELM model, improving its performance and accuracy in identifying the type of oil samples.\n\nThe KELM model, which is a type of extreme learning machine model, is known for its fast learning speed and good generalization ability. By combining it with the moth-flame optimization algorithm, the multiclassification learning model was able to quickly and accurately identify the type of edible oils.\n\nOverall, the fusion algorithm of moth-flame optimization and KELM enhanced the classification performance of the learning model, making it a quick and reliable method for identifying edible oils."

        "Output": "The stability and classification performance of the KELM model is similar to that of the extreme learning machine model and the back propagation neural network model in identifying edible oils using the laser induction fluorescence (LIF) technique and a multiclassification learning model. However, the KELM model has a lower standard deviation compared to the other two models. This indicates that the KELM model has a more stable classification performance and can quickly identify edible oils."
