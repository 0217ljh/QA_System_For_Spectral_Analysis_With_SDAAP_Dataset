        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of the chlorophyll-sensitive bands for TP concentration prediction was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that the PLS model performed well in terms of TP concentration prediction. In the training dataset, the R-2 and RMSE were 0.821 and 0.028 mg/L, respectively. In the testing dataset, the R-2 and RMSE were 0.741 and 0.029 mg/L, respectively. These values indicate a relatively high accuracy in predicting TP concentration using the chlorophyll-sensitive bands."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is reasonable to assume that the proposed method, which considers the correlation between chlorophyll and TP concentration, can be used to predict TP concentration in other macrophytic lakes experiencing severe eutrophication. The related study states that the method was used to predict TP concentration in Lake Baiyangdian, which is described as a typical macrophytic lake with severe eutrophication. The results of the study indicate that the method performs well in terms of TP concentration prediction."
