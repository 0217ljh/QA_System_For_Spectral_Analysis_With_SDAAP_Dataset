        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the Taylor-CC method is superior to the traditional PCC method in the development of Soil Plant Analysis for Camellia oleifera. The Taylor-CC method considers more local and global information of spectral function to estimate the linear/nonlinear correlation between two wavelengths. It identifies core wavelengths/bands of hyperspectral data by using Taylor expansion. \n\nIn comparison, the PCC method is derived from the Pearson correlation coefficient and does not take into account as much local and global information. \n\nThe study conducted experiments using samples of hyperspectral data and compared the results obtained from the Taylor-CC method and the PCC method. The correlation matrix generated by the Taylor-CC method showed a clear diagonal pattern with near zero values at most locations away from the diagonal. This indicates a strong correlation between the identified core wavelengths. \n\nAdditionally, three machine learning models (random forest-RF, linear regression-LR, and artificial neural network-ANN) were trained using the core wavelengths identified by both methods. The results showed that all three models confirmed the superiority of the Taylor-CC method over the PCC method. \n\nTherefore, based on the comparison of results and performance evaluation of the machine learning models, it can be concluded that the Taylor-CC method outperforms the traditional PCC method in hyperspectral data analysis."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the Taylor-CC method is superior to the traditional PCC method in the development of Soil Plant Analysis for sensitive band selection in the response mechanism between spectral characteristics and nutrient content of Camellia leaf. The Taylor-CC method, which utilizes Taylor expansion, considers both local and global information of spectral function to estimate the linear/nonlinear correlation between two wavelengths. It identifies core wavelengths/bands of hyperspectral data more effectively, taking into account the influence of non-target elements and minimizing the interference of background noise. \n\nComparing the results obtained from the Taylor-CC method and the PCC method, the correlation matrix generated by the Taylor-CC method exhibits a clear diagonal pattern with near-zero values at most locations away from the diagonal. This indicates a strong correlation between the identified core wavelengths/bands and the nutrient content of Camellia leaf. On the other hand, the PCC method, derived from the Pearson correlation coefficient, may not capture the same level of correlation and may be less effective in selecting sensitive bands.\n\nFurthermore, three machine learning models (random forest-RF, linear regression-LR, and artificial neural network-ANN) were trained using the core wavelengths identified by both methods."
