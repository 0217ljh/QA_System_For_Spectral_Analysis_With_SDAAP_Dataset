        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in estimating forest attributes was the percentage of the root mean squared error over the mean value (rRMSE). This metric measures the average difference between the observed and estimated stand variables as a percentage of the mean value. \n\nHowever, the rRMSE metric has its limitations. In the related study, the rRMSE values were quite high, above 50%, indicating relatively large errors in the estimation of forest attributes. This suggests that the models had limited accuracy in predicting the actual values of the forest attributes. Therefore, the rRMSE metric alone may not be sufficient to fully assess the performance of the models. Additional information and improvements in the modeling approach, such as incorporating stand information and new spectral products, may be necessary to increase the prediction accuracy of the models."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models, specifically the M5 model tree (M5P) and random forest (RF) methods, were used to estimate forest attributes of beech coppice forest stands in the Sarajevo Canton. The models were developed using training data subsets consisting of 402 sample plots. Predictor subset selection was performed based on wrapping, assuming M5P and RF learning schemes. The models were then evaluated using validation data subsets consisting of 207 sample plots. The performance of the models was assessed using the percentage of the root mean squared error over the mean value (rRMSE) and the square of the correlation coefficient between the observed and estimated stand variables."

        "Output": "Based on the information provided, the integration of forest inventory data and Sentinel S2A satellite data using machine learning methods shows potential for estimating forest attributes of beech coppice forest stands in the Sarajevo Canton. The study utilized machine learning rule-based M5 model tree (M5P) and random forest (RF) methods for attribute estimation. Predictor subset selection was based on wrapping assuming M5P and RF learning schemes.\n\nThe results showed that the predictor subset selection resulted in a varied number of predictors for forest attributes, with spectral biophysical variables dominating in subsets. The models developed using these methods had lower errors for training sets compared to the M5P method."
