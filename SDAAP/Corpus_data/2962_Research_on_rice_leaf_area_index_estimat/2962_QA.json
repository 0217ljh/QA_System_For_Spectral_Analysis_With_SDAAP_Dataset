        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the LAI estimation models is the coefficient of determination (R2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the LAI values that can be explained by the model. \n\nThe R2 value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the predicted and actual LAI values. Therefore, the higher the R2 value, the better the model's ability to accurately estimate LAI."

        "Output": "In the related study, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) combined with the pelican optimization algorithm (POA) was used in the rice LAI estimation models to incorporate both spectral and texture information fusion. The models were developed using two different sets of input parameters: spectral indicators alone and spectral indicators combined with texture measurements.\n\nFor the models using spectral indicators alone, the optimal spectral band, vegetation index, and trilateral parameters were obtained through preprocessing and feature band screening. The combined spectral parameters (SP) of the three were then used as the only input to the SVR model. The pelican optimization algorithm (POA) was applied to optimize the SVR model parameters and improve its accuracy. The performance of the model was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).\n\nFor the models incorporating texture information based on hyperspectral images, eight basic texture features based on Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) were extracted from the hyperspectral images."

        "Output": "The incorporation of texture information based on hyperspectral images improved the performance of the models in rice LAI estimation compared to using spectral indicators alone. The results showed that the models based on spectral indicators combined with texture measurements were all superior to those using spectral indicators alone. The best model achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.917, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.078, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.19%. This indicates that the inclusion of texture information enhanced the accuracy and precision of LAI estimation."
