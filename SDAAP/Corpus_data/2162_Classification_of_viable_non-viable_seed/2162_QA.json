        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification models in the study was classification accuracy. The accuracy values ranged from 0.56 to 0.91 for the standard germination (SG) test and from 0.53 to 0.85 for the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) test. \n\nIn terms of determining seed viability, the classification accuracy metric provides a measure of how well the models were able to correctly classify the seeds as viable or non-viable. Higher accuracy values indicate a higher level of correct classification. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that accuracy alone may not provide a complete picture of the reliability of the models in determining seed viability. Other metrics such as sensitivity and specificity are also important to consider. Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual viable seeds that were correctly identified as viable, while specificity measures the proportion of actual non-viable seeds that were correctly identified as non-viable. \n\nIn this study, the models based on the TTC test results had higher sensitivity values (ranging from 0.86 to 0.99) than specificity values (ranging from 0.07 to 0.74). This indicates that the models were more accurate in identifying viable seeds than non-viable seeds. \n\nOverall,"
