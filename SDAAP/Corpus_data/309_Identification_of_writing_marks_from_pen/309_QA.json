        "Output": "Yes, the combination of LIBS (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy) and machine learning can be considered a superior method for identifying pencil marks in questioned documents compared to traditional methods. The past study demonstrates that by analyzing the spectral data of pencil marks and comparing them to the spectral data of pencil lead, a high identification accuracy of 97.9% and 98.33% was achieved using BP neural network and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) models based on principal component analysis (PCA). This indicates that the combination of LIBS and machine learning can provide a more accurate and reliable approach for identifying pencil marks in questioned documents, making it a promising method for document examination in the judicial field."
