        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed method is Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss with a regularization term. This metric measures the average squared difference between the predicted water depth values and the actual water depth values in the dataset.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the MSE loss can provide a quantitative measure of the performance of the proposed method. A lower MSE value indicates better accuracy, as it means the predicted water depth values are closer to the actual values."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of the spatial-aware feature extraction block (SAB) in the spatial-aware neural network (SAN-Net) proposed for shallow water depth inversion is to capture the spatial features of the neighborhood and improve the feature expression of shallow water depth inversion. The SAB consists of two convolutional pooling operations, which allow it to analyze the surrounding pixels and extract relevant spatial information. By incorporating this spatial awareness, the SAB helps the SAN-Net to better understand the spatial relationships between different depth pixels, enabling more accurate and precise predictions of shallow water depth."
