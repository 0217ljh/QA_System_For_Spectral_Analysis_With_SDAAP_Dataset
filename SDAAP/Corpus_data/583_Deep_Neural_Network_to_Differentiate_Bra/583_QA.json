        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related work, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) appears to be a promising method for measuring frontotemporal activity in patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) and healthy controls (HCs). The related study found that reduced brain cortical activity over the frontotemporal regions was observed in FES patients compared to HCs during verbal fluency tests (VFTs). \n\nIn terms of classification accuracy, the study compared the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep neural network (DNN) classifier. The DNN classifier achieved a higher accuracy (79.7%) compared to the SVM classifier (68.6%) in differentiating between FES patients and HCs based on the NIRS signals during the VFTs. This suggests that NIRS, when combined with DNN, may be a superior method for distinguishing FES patients from HCs compared to traditional methods. "
