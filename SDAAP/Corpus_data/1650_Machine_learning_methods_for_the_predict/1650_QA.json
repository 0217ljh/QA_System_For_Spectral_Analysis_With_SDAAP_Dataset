        "Output": "The text does not explicitly mention the specific metric that was chosen to evaluate the prediction performance of the machine learning methods. However, it does state that the mean average percentage error for predicting C14:0 was less than 7%. This suggests that the mean average percentage error (MAPE) could potentially be the metric used to assess the prediction performance.\n\nIn terms of assessing accuracy, the text does not provide a specific range or threshold for determining the accuracy level. It only mentions that the prediction performance for C14:0 had a low mean average percentage error, indicating a relatively accurate prediction. However, it does not provide any information on how accurate the prediction for CLA was. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how far the chosen metric can go in assessing accuracy based on the information provided in the text."

The text only mentions that machine learning methods, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, were used to predict the content of these fatty acids. It does not provide any comparison or evaluation of the performance of traditional methods in predicting these fatty acids."
