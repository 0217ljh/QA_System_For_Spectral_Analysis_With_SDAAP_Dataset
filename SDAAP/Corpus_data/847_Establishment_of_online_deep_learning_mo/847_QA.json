        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the SGS pretreatment combined with the CBAM-CNN deep learning method can be considered as a superior spectroscopic method compared to traditional methods for improving the import and export trade competitiveness of Yali pears. The research paper states that this online discriminant model achieved the best performance with high accuracy on the calibration and validation sets. Additionally, the prediction time for a single pear was also within the requirements for online sorting. Therefore, this method can effectively detect recessive insect-affected pests in Yali pears during the commercial sorting process, allowing for real-time and accurate inspection. This would enhance the overall quality control and competitiveness of Yali pears in the import and export trade."
