        "Output": "The most important variables identified in the study that contributed to the mapping accuracy of the natural forest in South Africa using SVM and RF algorithms were the red, blue, green, Near Infrared, and Short-Wave Infrared bands. These variables were found to be sensitive to vegetation and played a significant role in accurately classifying the forest into specific thematic cover classes."
