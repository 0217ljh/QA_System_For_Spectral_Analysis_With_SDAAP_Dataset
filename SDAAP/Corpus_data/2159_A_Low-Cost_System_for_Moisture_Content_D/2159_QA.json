        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the MC models in the online system is the coefficient of determination of prediction (r(2)). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the moisture content (MC) that can be explained by the model. \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the r(2) value achieved by the best-performing model, PCA-RFR, was 0.72. The r(2) value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit between the predicted and actual values. Therefore, an r(2) value of 0.72 indicates a relatively high level of accuracy in predicting the moisture content of sugarcane bagasse. However, it is important to note that there is still room for improvement, as the model does not achieve a perfect fit."
