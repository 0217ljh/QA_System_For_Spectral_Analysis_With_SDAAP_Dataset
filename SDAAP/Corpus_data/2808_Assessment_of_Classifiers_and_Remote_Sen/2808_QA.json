        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for tree species recognition in a diverse arboretum was the proportion of correctly-classified trees. This metric measures the accuracy of the classification model in correctly identifying the tree species and genus. The study found that the combination of calibrated reflectance features from VNIR and SWIR imagery, along with 3D point cloud features, achieved the best result. The proportion of correctly-classified trees was 0.823 for tree species and 0.869 for tree genus. This means that the model was able to correctly classify approximately 82.3% of the tree species and 86.9% of the tree genus in the test area."

        "Output": "The alternative classifiers, k nearest neighbor method combined with a genetic algorithm and random forest method, were effective in predicting tree species and genus using the aerial hyperspectral imagery and high spatial resolution photogrammetric color imagery. However, the k nearest neighbor method combined with the genetic algorithm provided consistently better results than the random forest algorithm. The best result was achieved using calibrated reflectance features from VNIR and SWIR imagery together with 3D point cloud features, with a proportion of correctly-classified trees of 0.823 for tree species and 0.869 for tree genus."

        "Output": "The combination of VNIR, SWIR, and 3D features performed better than any of the data sets individually in terms of tree species recognition in the diverse arboretum. The study found that using calibrated reflectance features from VNIR and SWIR imagery together with 3D point cloud features resulted in the highest proportion of correctly-classified trees. The proportion of correctly-classified trees was 0.823 for tree species and 0.869 for tree genus."
