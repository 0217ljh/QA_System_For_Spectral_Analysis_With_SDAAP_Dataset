        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction model to predict the soil Hg content is the coefficient of determination (R-squared or R^2). The R^2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the soil Hg content that can be explained by the hyperspectral data and the prediction model. \n\nAccording to the results mentioned in the text, the best prediction model achieved an R-train^2 value of 0.94 and an R-test^2 value of 0.85. These values indicate that the model can explain 94% of the variance in the training data and 85% of the variance in the testing data. \n\nBased on these results, the chosen metric (R^2) suggests that the prediction model can accurately predict soil Hg content to a significant extent."
