        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the blood-based infrared spectroscopy is sensitivity and specificity. \n\nThe sensitivity of the blood-based infrared spectroscopy for detecting endometrial cancer is 87%, meaning that it correctly identifies 87% of women with endometrial cancer. \n\nThe specificity of the blood-based infrared spectroscopy is 78%, indicating that it correctly identifies 78% of healthy controls without endometrial cancer."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Blood-based infrared spectroscopy shows promise as a cost-effective and minimally invasive approach for the early detection and diagnosis of endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia. The study found that this method had a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 78% for detecting endometrial cancer, with even higher accuracy for Type I endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia. These results suggest that blood-based infrared spectroscopy could potentially be a superior method compared to current invasive, expensive, and moderately accurate approaches for the early detection and diagnosis of endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia."
