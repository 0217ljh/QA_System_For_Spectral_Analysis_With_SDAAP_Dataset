        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the model effectiveness in this study was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (above-ground biomass) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices). The RMSE value measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values of above-ground biomass."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the model using all extracted spectral information and derived spectral vegetation indices in estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) in the studied buffer zone community forest was better compared to traditional methods. The model achieved an R-2 value of 0.81 and an RMSE value of 25.57 t ha(-1), indicating a relatively high level of accuracy in estimating AGB. This suggests that the use of medium-resolution Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data, along with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, as an alternative to hyperspectral data, is effective in inaccessible regions like buffer zone areas. The technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, including fine spatial resolution and strategically-positioned bands, combined with the advanced machine learning algorithm, contributed to the improved performance of the model."
