        "Output": "The use of machine learning algorithms in automating the performance modeling of LULC maps for city planning has shown to be more accurate and robust compared to traditional methods. \n\nIn the study, seven schemes were designed and six machine learning algorithms were used to automate the LULC performance modeling for the city of Melbourne, Australia. The experimental results showed that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the other machine learning algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, achieving a high accuracy of 0.99 on all schemes.\n\nThis indicates that the machine learning algorithms were able to accurately classify the land use and land cover categories in the LULC maps. In contrast, traditional methods may not have achieved such high accuracy levels.\n\nFurthermore, the robustness of the machine learning algorithms was also demonstrated. The statistical analysis showed that the Random Forest algorithm consistently achieved an F1-score of over 0.99 for all five categories, indicating its reliability and consistency. The p-value of 0.05 from the Wilcoxon ranked test over accuracy measures further supports the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.\n\nIn comparison, traditional methods may not have provided such robustness in terms of consistently high performance across different categories and varying training splits."
