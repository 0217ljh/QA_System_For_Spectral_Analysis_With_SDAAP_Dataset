        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the classifications in this study was the True Skill Statistic (TSS), which measures the ability of the classification model to correctly identify both the presence and absence of the invasive water-hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). \n\nThe TSS value obtained in the related study was 0.932, indicating a high level of accuracy in distinguishing between invaded and non-invaded areas. \n\nIn terms of assessing the success of control actions for the invasive water-hyacinth, the TSS metric can provide valuable information. By comparing the classifications before and after control actions, changes in the TSS value can indicate the effectiveness of the management strategies implemented. If the TSS value increases after control actions, it suggests that the invasive water-hyacinth has been successfully reduced or controlled. Conversely, if the TSS value remains low or decreases, it indicates that the control actions may not have been effective in managing the invasive species. \n\nTherefore, the TSS metric can be a useful tool in assessing the success of control actions for the invasive water-hyacinth, providing insights into the effectiveness of management strategies and guiding future monitoring and intervention efforts."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study used classifier fusion techniques implemented in the biomod2 predictive modelling package. The classifier fusion techniques were fed with selected spectral regions to extract a spectral signature from the synchronized day and identify pixels with similar reflectance values over time. The predictions from statistical and machine-learning algorithms were ensembled to map invaded spaces across the whole study area during all seasons."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the approach of using unmanned aerial vehicle imagery synchronized with free Sentinel-2 multispectral data and classifier fusion techniques can be considered superior to traditional methods for mapping the invasive water-hyacinth in the Cavado River. The study conducted in northern Portugal demonstrated that this novel approach provided high accuracy values in mapping invaded spaces across the whole study area during all seasons. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles and multispectral data allowed for spatially and temporally explicit information on the occurrence of the invasive species, which is essential for efficient regional and local action plans. The classifier fusion techniques further enhanced the accuracy of the mapping by extracting spectral signatures and identifying pixels with similar reflectance values over time. This approach not only supports more efficient monitoring actions for non-stationary invasive species but also enables the assessment of the success of control actions and the implementation of long-term strategic monitoring."
