        "input": "",
        "Output": "Underwater hyperspectral imaging combined with machine learning has been shown to be effective in accurately classifying the health status of both orange and white color morphs of Lophelia pertusa corals. In this study, coral samples were exposed to varying concentrations of the toxic compound 2-methylnaphthalene, and their reflectance spectra were used to classify them according to lethal concentration (LC) levels. The machine learning model successfully classified the coral samples to the correct concentration group, indicating its ability to detect changes in the health status of the corals.\n\nThis method shows promise as a remote sensing technique for monitoring the health of coral reefs and assessing the environmental impact on deep-water coral habitats. By using hyperspectral imaging, which captures a wide range of wavelengths, it is possible to gather detailed information about the corals' reflectance spectra. This can provide insights into their health condition and detect early signs of damage before severe impacts occur.\n\nThe ability to remotely monitor coral reefs over larger areas is crucial for effective conservation and management efforts. By developing a remote sensing technique using underwater hyperspectral imaging and machine learning, it becomes possible to assess the health of coral reefs on a larger scale and detect changes in their condition."
