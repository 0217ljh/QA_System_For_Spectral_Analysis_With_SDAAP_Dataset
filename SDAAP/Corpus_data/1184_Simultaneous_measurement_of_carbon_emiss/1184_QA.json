        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictive performance of the model in the study was the gradient-weighted regression activation mapping (Grad-RAM) analysis. The Grad-RAM analysis revealed that the model utilizes the broadband spectrum for temperature prediction and correction of changes in peak intensity due to temperature changes in the concentration prediction process. The Grad-RAM analysis can provide insights into how the model is making predictions and can help improve model performance."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of broadband continuum spectra in the proposed method contributes to the improved predictive performance for gas temperature and CO2 concentration compared to models trained without it in the following ways:\n\n1. Enhanced temperature prediction: The broadband continuum spectrum contains information about the gas density, which is directly related to the gas temperature. By including this spectrum in the training data, the machine learning model can learn to utilize the broadband spectrum to predict the gas temperature more accurately. This allows for a more precise estimation of the temperature, leading to improved predictive performance.\n\n2. Correction of peak intensity changes: The concentration of species in the gas can affect the peak intensity ratios used for mapping species concentrations. However, these peak intensity ratios are also influenced by changes in gas density. By including the broadband continuum spectrum, the model can correct for changes in peak intensity due to temperature variations. This correction helps in accurately predicting the concentration changes, resulting in improved predictive performance for CO2 concentration.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of the broadband continuum spectrum in the training data enables the machine learning model to better understand the relationship between gas temperature, CO2 concentration, and the spectral features. This leads to improved predictive performance for both gas temperature and CO2 concentration compared to models trained without the broadband continuum spectra."
