        "Output": "Yes, the integration of infrared hyperspectral and photogrammetric data in the workflow can provide a more efficient and accurate method for palaeoseismic observations compared to traditional methods. This new workflow allows for the correction and processing of hyperspectral imagery using established image processing algorithms and machine learning approaches. Additionally, the integration of photogrammetric data through structure-from-motion techniques enables the creation of 3D virtual outcrop models. These models provide a visual representation of the outcrop and allow for unbiased assessment of the mineralogical composition of lithologic units and semi-automatic delineation of contacts and deformational structures. Overall, this integrated approach reduces the time-consuming nature of traditional methods and minimizes biases and inaccuracies, leading to more efficient and accurate palaeoseismic observations."
