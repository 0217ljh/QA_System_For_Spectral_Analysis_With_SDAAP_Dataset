        "Output": "The metric chosen to determine the most informative spectral bands was the coefficient of determination (R2). This metric can go as far as identifying dialysis patients by correlating the serum spectral characteristics with the levels of creatinine and urea, which are markers of decreased kidney clearance."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the identified informative spectral bands (641 cm-1, 724 cm-1, 1094 cm-1, 1393 cm-1, and 1001 cm-1) can be used in the multivariate analysis of SERS characteristics of serum in hemodialysis patients to construct classification models for identifying dialysis patients. These spectral bands have been found to be associated with the degree of kidney function inhibition and can demonstrate the distinctive features of hemodialysis patients with end-stage CKD. By incorporating these spectral bands into classification models such as PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), it is possible to develop accurate models for identifying dialysis patients."
