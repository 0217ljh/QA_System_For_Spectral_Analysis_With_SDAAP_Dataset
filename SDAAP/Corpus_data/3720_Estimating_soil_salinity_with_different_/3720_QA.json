        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of spectral classification improved the stability and predictive ability of the models in the study by classifying the Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC). By dividing the FVC into different categories (bare land, mid-low FVC, mid FVC, and high FVC), the researchers were able to better understand the relationship between vegetation coverage and soil salinization. This classification allowed for more accurate and targeted analysis of the data, leading to more reliable predictions of soil salt content. The results indicated that classifying FVC improved the performance of the models, suggesting that considering different levels of vegetation coverage is important in understanding and managing soil salinization."
