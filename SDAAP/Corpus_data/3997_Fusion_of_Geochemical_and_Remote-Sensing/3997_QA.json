        "input": "",
        "Output": "The hybrid model comprising data fusion and machine learning contributes to lithological mapping in the Cuonadong Dome in China by integrating multisource geoscience data to provide more abundant information. This model combines geochemical data and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) remote-sensing images through data fusion technology. By retaining both the geochemical patterns and the textural structure of the remote-sensing images, the hybrid model enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of lithological mapping. Additionally, the model utilizes a random forest metric learning (RFML) approach, which incorporates metric learning in the classification process of each decision tree calculation. This approach maximizes the advantages of random forest and metric learning, resulting in a high classification performance. In the case study of the Cuonadong Dome, the hybrid model successfully discriminated seven target lithological units with an overall accuracy of 93.0%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid method in geological exploration, particularly in areas with limited geological research and poor environments."
