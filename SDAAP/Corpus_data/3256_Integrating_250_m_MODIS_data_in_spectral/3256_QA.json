        "input": "",
        "Output": "The spatio-temporal spectral unmixing model used in the related study improves the accuracy of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) estimation by addressing two key challenges. \n\nFirstly, it deals with the inconsistency between training and predicting data by extracting training samples at the prediction time directly. This means that the training samples used to train the model are constructed based on data acquired at the same time as the prediction, reducing uncertainty in FVC estimation. By using samples that are temporally aligned with the prediction, the model can better capture the current state of the vegetation and provide more accurate estimates.\n\nSecondly, the model integrates additional features from 250 m MODIS data with the original 500 m MODIS data. These new features, specifically from the Red and NIR bands, are stacked with the original 500 m features during sample construction. By incorporating these additional features, the model can better handle areas with strong heterogeneity, where vegetation may not be reliably identified from the complex background. This improves the ability of the model to accurately estimate FVC in areas with diverse vegetation types and complex landscapes."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Incorporating 250 m features and using training samples extracted at the prediction time improves the accuracy of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) estimation compared to traditional methods in several ways. \n\nFirstly, by integrating 250 m features with the original 500 m MODIS data, the proposed method takes advantage of higher resolution data, which provides more detailed information about the vegetation cover. This additional information helps to better identify and distinguish vegetation from complex backgrounds, especially in areas with strong heterogeneity. As a result, the accuracy of FVC mapping is increased significantly.\n\nSecondly, using training samples extracted at the prediction time directly addresses the issue of inconsistency between training and predicting data. Traditional methods often construct training samples based on data acquired at a different time, leading to uncertainty in FVC estimation. By extracting training samples at the prediction time, the proposed method ensures that the training data is more representative of the actual conditions during prediction. This improves the reliability of the model training and subsequently enhances the accuracy of FVC estimation.\n\nOverall, incorporating 250 m features and using training samples extracted at the prediction time allows for a more comprehensive and accurate estimation of FVC.
