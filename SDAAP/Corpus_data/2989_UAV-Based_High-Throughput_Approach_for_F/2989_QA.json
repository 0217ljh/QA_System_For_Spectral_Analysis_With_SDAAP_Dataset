Based on the information provided in the related study, it can be inferred that the proposed high-throughput strategy for predicting the biomass of forests using UAVs, hyperspectral image sensors, and data processing algorithms is considered superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The related study mentions that obtaining accurate measurements of tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH) using LiDAR and 3-D modeling is still a significant challenge. In contrast, the novel strategy described in the related study combines unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hyperspectral image sensors, and data processing algorithms using machine learning to measure the biomass of different tree cultivars in plantation forests with high crown density. The use of UAVs and hyperspectral image sensors allows for more precise and detailed data collection, while the data processing algorithms and machine learning techniques enhance the accuracy of biomass prediction. Additionally, the related study mentions that the classifier generated by random forests had the best prediction accuracy (75%) compared to other algorithms. Therefore, the proposed strategy can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency."
