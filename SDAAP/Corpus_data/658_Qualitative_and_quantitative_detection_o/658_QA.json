        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in related study, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy can be considered an effective method for detecting drug-induced liver injury in mice. The related study utilized this technology and found that it could effectively identify the degree of liver injury, providing an auxiliary diagnostic method for detecting minor liver injury. However, the related study does not directly compare terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to traditional methods, so it cannot be definitively stated whether it is superior to traditional methods based solely on this study."
