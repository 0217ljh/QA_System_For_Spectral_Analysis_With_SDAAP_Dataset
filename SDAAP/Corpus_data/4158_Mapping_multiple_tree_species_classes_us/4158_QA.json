        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed hierarchical classification procedure with optimized node variables and thresholds can be considered superior to traditional methods such as random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods in terms of overall land cover and forest classification accuracy percentages. The results of the study show that the proposed procedure accurately maps the tree species distribution with an overall accuracy of over 86% for both training and test stages. Additionally, the overall forest classification accuracy using the proposed method is more accurate than that using RF and CART, with 3.21% and 7.56% higher overall land cover classification accuracy and 4.68% and 10.28% higher overall forest classification accuracy than RF and CART, respectively. Therefore, the proposed approach outperforms the traditional methods in terms of accuracy for both land cover and forest classification."
