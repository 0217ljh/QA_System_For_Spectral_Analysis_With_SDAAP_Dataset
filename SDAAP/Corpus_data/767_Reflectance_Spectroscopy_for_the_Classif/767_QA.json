        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study is the kappa coefficient analysis, which measures the agreement between the predicted classifications and the actual classifications. The results of the kappa coefficient analysis ranged from 92 to 100% in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) to near-infrared (NIR) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, indicating high classification accuracy and precision.\n\nIn addition to the kappa coefficient analysis, predictive models based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) were also used. These models achieved R-2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.89, indicating a good fit between the predicted and actual values. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) values for each pigment in C-3 and C-4 plants was over 2.1, further demonstrating the accuracy and precision of the models.\n\nOverall, the chosen metrics, including the kappa coefficient analysis and PLSR models, showed high levels of accuracy and precision in evaluating and predicting pigments in agronomic crops."
