        "Output": "The metric chosen to detect changes in soilless tomato crop grown under varying irrigation regimes was crop reflectance, measured using a hyperspectral camera. This metric was used to calculate several crop indices, including the modified red simple ratio index (mrSRI), the modified red normalized vegetation index (mrNDVI), and the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption Reflectance Index (TCARI). \n\nThe study found that when the mrSRI and mrNDVI values increased by more than 2.5% and 23% respectively, the substrate volumetric water content decreased by more than 3%. Additionally, when the TCARI value increased by about 16%, the leaf chlorophyll content decreased by about 3%. \n\nBased on these results, the metric of crop reflectance, along with the calculated crop indices, can be used to estimate plant water status in tomato crops grown under controlled environments."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, hyperspectral machine vision can be considered a superior non-contact method for estimating plant water status in tomato crops compared to traditional methods. The study used hyperspectral machine vision as a non-contact technique to detect changes in spectral reflectance of a soilless tomato crop grown under varying irrigation regimes. The results showed that crop reflectance increased with increasing water deficit, and several crop indices calculated from the reflectance measurements were correlated with substrate volumetric water content and tomato leaf chlorophyll content. This suggests that hyperspectral machine vision can accurately assess plant water status in tomato crops."
