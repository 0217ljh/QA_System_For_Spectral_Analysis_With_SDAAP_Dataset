Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR): This model was constructed based on combinations of vegetation indices (VIs) to improve the estimation accuracy of apple CCC.\n\n2. Artificial Neural Network Regression (ANN): This model was also constructed based on combinations of VIs to estimate the CCC of apple trees.\n\n3. Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR): Similar to PLSR and ANN, this model was constructed using combinations of VIs to estimate the CCC of apple trees.\n\n4. Random Forest Regression (RF) Model: This model was constructed based on combinations of VIs to estimate the CCC of apple trees.\n\n5. Support Vector Machine Combination Regression (C-SVR) Model: This model was constructed using combinations of VIs and the ensemble learning approach. It achieved better estimation results compared to other models.\n\nThe study compared the performance of these models and found that the C-SVR model had higher R-V(2) and RPDV values, indicating better estimation accuracy for apple CCC."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of hyperspectral vegetation indices can be considered superior to traditional methods for estimating the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of apple trees in precision agriculture. The study used hyperspectral vegetation indices combined with ensemble learning approaches to estimate the CCC of apple trees. The results showed that the correlation coefficients between certain vegetation indices and apple CCC were above 0.76, indicating a strong relationship. The models constructed using the hyperspectral vegetation indices achieved better estimation results compared to traditional methods such as partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural network regression (ANN), and support vector machine regression (SVR). The C-SVR model, in particular, showed an increase in R-V(2) and RPDV values by 5.0% and 7.1% respectively, compared to the other models. This suggests that the use of hyperspectral vegetation indices, combined with ensemble learning approaches, can provide higher accuracy in estimating the CCC of apple trees in precision agriculture."
