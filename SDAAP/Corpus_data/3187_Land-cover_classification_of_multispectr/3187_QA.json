Traditional CNN models often have a large number of layers, which leads to higher computational costs. However, the proposed framework addresses this issue by optimizing the hyper-parameters of the CNN model. As a result, the constructed CNN model with the optimized hyper-parameters demonstrates superior computational performance compared to classical CNN models such as AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50.\n\nIn addition to improved computational performance, the proposed framework also achieves higher classification accuracies. By utilizing the completeness and consistency of the spectrum and spatial geometric data provided by multi-spectral LiDAR, the CNN model in the framework is able to learn and express stronger features. This leads to more accurate land-cover classification compared to traditional machine learning methods.\n\nOverall, the proposed CNN-based multi-spectral LiDAR land-cover classification framework offers improved classification accuracy and computational performance compared to traditional methods."
