        "Output": "The machine learning algorithm in the related study was trained using historical field data and spectral information from satellite images. The algorithm was trained on 5 years of historical data from a Moroccan orchard composed of 50 parcels. The data included information such as climate, irrigation water usage, fertilization products, phytosanitary treatment dose, parcel size, and root-stock type for each parcel. Additionally, two popular indices, the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index, were extracted from Sentinel 2 and Landsat satellite images. These data were combined to create a total dataset of 250 rows, representing the 50 parcels over a period of 5 years, with each row labeled with the yield of the corresponding parcel. The machine learning algorithm was then tested and optimized using various parameter settings."

        "Output": "Yes, based on the findings of the related study, the developed approach using spectral information from satellite images can be applied to other tree crops to predict fruit yield. The study mentions that the approach was tested on a citrus orchard and yielded good prediction scores. It also states that the same approach can be used on other tree crops to achieve the same goal of predicting fruit yield. Therefore, it can be concluded that the developed approach has the potential to be applied to other tree crops for fruit yield prediction."
