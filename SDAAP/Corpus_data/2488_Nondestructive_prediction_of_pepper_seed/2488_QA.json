        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in predicting pepper seed germination was accuracy. The accuracy of the hyperspectral model was reported to be 88.99% for germination prediction, while the X-ray model had an accuracy of 75.33%. The ensemble-based information fusion model achieved the highest accuracy of 92.51%. Therefore, the chosen metric of accuracy can provide a good indication of the models' performance in predicting seed germination, with the ensemble-based information fusion model being the most accurate among the models evaluated."
