        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study's use of hyperspectral imaging combined with deep learning approaches is shown to outperform traditional methods in identifying the varieties of sweet maize seeds. The experimental analysis results indicate that the deep learning model achieved a classification accuracy of over 95% in both the training and test sets. This suggests that the combination of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning is a more effective and accurate approach compared to traditional methods such as support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and backpropagation (BP). Additionally, the proposed CNN-LSTM model performed slightly better than the other five models, further highlighting the superiority of the deep learning approach. Overall, the study demonstrates that deep learning combined with hyperspectral imaging has the potential to be a valuable alternative for identifying the variety of sweet maize seeds."
