        "Output": "The potential applications of the presented hyperspectral dataset in general regression and classification research and experiments include:\n\n1) Mineral sample characterisation: The dataset provides hyperspectral reflectance images in the VNIR and SWIR spectral ranges, which can be used to characterize different mineral samples. This can be valuable in geological studies, mining operations, and mineral exploration.\n\n2) Geometallurgical analysis: The dataset includes hyperspectral reflectance images merged to SWIR spatial resolution, which can be used for geometallurgical analysis. This involves studying the relationship between the mineralogy and metallurgical properties of ore deposits, which is crucial in optimizing mineral processing operations.\n\n3) Remote sensing: The hyperspectral reflectance images can be used for remote sensing applications, such as land cover classification, vegetation analysis, and environmental monitoring. The dataset covers a wide spectral range, allowing for detailed analysis of various features and materials on the Earth's surface.\n\n4) Sensor fusion: The dataset includes RGB images constructed from hyperspectral data using a Bilateral Filter based sensor fusion method. This can be useful in sensor fusion research, where different types of sensors are combined to enhance the quality and accuracy of data."
