        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models is the coefficient of determination (R-p(2)), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the R-p(2) value indicates the proportion of the total variation in the N content that can be explained by the model. The closer the R-p(2) value is to 1, the more accurate the model is in predicting the N content. \n\nThe RMSEP value represents the average difference between the predicted and actual N content values. A lower RMSEP value indicates higher accuracy in predicting the N content. \n\nThe RPD value is a measure of the model's ability to differentiate between different N content levels. A higher RPD value indicates better accuracy in distinguishing between different N levels. \n\nBased on the given information, the best-performing model, the PLS(LVs)_ELM model, achieved an R-p(2) value of 0.837, an RMSEP value of 2.393, and an RPD value of 2.220. These values suggest that the model has a good level of accuracy in predicting the N content in apple trees."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The RC_02 method for variable extraction based on LVs is compared to other spectral data processing methods in terms of accuracy and prediction results for estimating apple tree nitrogen (N) status. The results indicate that the RC_02 method, which extracts variables with an RC threshold based on the minimum RMSEP, effectively avoids the omission of effective information. This method is recommended for research that requires accurate wavelength information as a variable.\n\nIn terms of accuracy and prediction results, the RC_02 method performs well compared to other methods. The spectral data processed by SG_FD (Savitzky-Golay smoothing and second-order derivative) had the highest signal-to-noise ratio and was selected for subsequent analysis. The RC_02 method extracted 88 variables, which is more than the other methods. This suggests that it captures a larger amount of relevant information.\n\nThe prediction results showed that the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) model, based on the variable extraction method using LVs and the RC_02 method, outperformed the PLS (Partial Least Squares) model."
