        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the research, two machine learning models were utilized to identify different producing years of dried tangerine using hyperspectral technique. \n\nFirstly, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the spectral data to obtain a qualitative analysis of the dried tangerine. This analysis helped in identifying the important components or variables in the data.\n\nSecondly, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to compare the performances of full-spectra and sensitive variables. PLS-DA is a supervised classification method that combines the features of partial least squares regression and discriminant analysis. It was used to build a linear model based on the sensitive bands identified from the PCA analysis.\n\nAdditionally, an extreme learning machine (ELM) model, which is a type of feedforward neural network, was also established based on the sensitive bands. ELM models were found to outperform PLS-DA in terms of predictive accuracy.\n\nThe results showed that the highest accuracy achieved in the model set was 100% using the ELM model, and 98.33% in the prediction set. The prediction accuracy rate was consistently higher than 85% regardless of the placement of the dried tangerine."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral technique combined with chemometric methods can be used to identify different producing years of dried tangerine, as demonstrated in the research. The research collected hyperspectral images of dried tangerine samples from different producing years and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze the spectral data. Regression coefficient (RC) was used to select the sensitive variables, and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to compare the performances of full-spectra and sensitive variables. The results showed that the hyperspectral technique with chemometric models achieved high accuracy in identifying the different producing years of dried tangerine."
