These algorithms were applied to the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data, which are the multispectral data used for discriminating basalts in the study area. \n\nThe study utilized three different algorithms to construct six models: \n1. KNN prediction of basalts by ASTER images\n2. SVM prediction by ASTER\n3. MLC prediction by ASTER\n4. KNN prediction by Landsat-5 images\n5. SVM prediction by Landsat-5\n6. MLC prediction by Landsat-5\n\nThese algorithms were used to classify and identify the presence of basalts in the study area based on the spectral characteristics of the multispectral data. The performance of each model was evaluated in terms of precision and accuracy to determine the optimum model for identifying basalts."
