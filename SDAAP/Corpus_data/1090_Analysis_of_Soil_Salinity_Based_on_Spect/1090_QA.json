        "input": "",
        "Output": "The improved ELM model in the related study aims to improve the traditional salt content detection methods of saline-alkali soils by using spectroscopy combined with an improved extreme learning machine (ELM) model. The model utilizes the principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the characteristics of the spectral data and then establishes a classification model for the spectral data using the ELM algorithm. Additionally, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of the model, improving its accuracy and speed. By combining the advantages of multilayer ELM with random values (RV-MELM) and the multi-layer ELM model optimized by an improved PSO algorithm (IPSO-MELM), the model is able to search for the optimal values and improve the speed of model optimization. This approach saves time and economic costs compared to traditional methods, making it a more efficient and feasible solution for salt content detection in saline-alkali soils."
