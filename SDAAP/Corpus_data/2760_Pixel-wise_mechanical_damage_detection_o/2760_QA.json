        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of the online tensor dictionary learning algorithm in the SSFE-FCNN classification method for mechanical damage detection on waxy maize is to extract spectral-spatial tensor features from the hyperspectral image (HSI) cubes. This algorithm helps in learning a dictionary of tensor atoms that can effectively represent the spectral-spatial information in the HSI data. By utilizing this dictionary, the SSFE-FCNN is able to extract high-level features from the tensor features and improve the detection performance for mechanical damage on waxy maize."
