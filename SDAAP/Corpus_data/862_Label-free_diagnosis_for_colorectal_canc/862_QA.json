        "Output": "The machine learning models, specifically the support-vector machine (SVM), were utilized in the analysis of the obtained spectra from cancer patients and healthy volunteers for the swift diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The spectra were first analyzed using unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA). Then, the SVM model was employed as a supervised machine learning technique to classify the CRC diagnosis. The SVM model provided superior performance compared to PCA in the classification of CRC. Additionally, the values of carcinoembryonic antigen from the blood samples were combined with the corresponding SERS spectra for SVM calculation, resulting in improved prediction results."
