        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of the new cloud-base height (CBH) inversion algorithm based on infrared hyperspectral radiation using a machine learning algorithm is higher compared to traditional physical algorithms. The correlation coefficients (CCs) between the inversion results of CBH from the new algorithm and the measurement results of the Vaisala CL31 ceilometer (VCEIL) are about 0.9 at the SGP site and 0.85 at the NSA site. In contrast, the CC of the CBH inversion results between the traditional physical algorithm (CO2 slicing algorithm) and VCEIL is only about 0.7 and 0.65, respectively. Therefore, the new algorithm demonstrates improved accuracy in determining CBH compared to traditional physical algorithms."
