The coefficient of determination (R-2) for multi-source data fusion yield estimation models ranged from 0.50 to 0.71, which was higher than the R-2 values for yield estimation models using only multi-spectral sensor data (0.53 to 0.69) or RGB sensor data (0.35 to 0.51). \n\nCompared to using RGB data alone, the multi-source data fusion models increased the R-2 by 0.17 to 0.23 and decreased the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.06 to 0.09 t center dot hm(-2). Compared to using multi-spectral data alone, the multi-source data fusion models increased the R-2 by 0.01 to 0.06 and decreased the RMSE by 0.01 to 0.03 t center dot hm(-2)."
