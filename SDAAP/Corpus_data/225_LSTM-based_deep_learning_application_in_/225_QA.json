        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification performance of the CAD system in past study was accuracy. The accuracy was reported as a percentage value, with the classical methods (K-Nearest Neighborhood, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Trees) achieving an average accuracy of 83% +/- 6.36%. However, the LSTM-based deep learning method proposed in past study achieved a higher accuracy of 93%. Therefore, the accuracy metric in past study ranged from 83% to 93%."

        "Output": "The classification performance of the deep learning method based on LSTM is higher than the classical methods (KEYK, SVM, and DT) in the CAD system developed for tumor detection through MR spectroscopy. The deep learning method achieved a classification performance of 93%, while the classical methods achieved around 83 +/- 6.36%. This indicates that the deep learning method outperformed the classical methods in classifying MRS data and can be used effectively in a CAD system to assist experts in the decision-making process for tumor detection."
