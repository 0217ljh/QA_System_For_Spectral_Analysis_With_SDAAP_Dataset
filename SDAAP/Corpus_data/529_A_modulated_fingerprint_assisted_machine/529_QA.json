Traditionally, obtaining elastic moduli from RUS spectra requires user intervention and the use of published analysis codes. This process can be time-consuming and may introduce errors or inaccuracies.\n\nIn contrast, the modulated fingerprint method utilizes deep-learning-based models and neural networks to automatically obtain elastic moduli from RUS spectra. By converting theoretical RUS spectra into modulated fingerprints and using them as a dataset to train the models, the researchers were able to predict elastic moduli with high accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, the modulated fingerprint-based models were able to successfully predict elastic moduli from both theoretical test spectra and a measured steel RUS spectrum with missing resonances. The models were also capable of resolving RUS spectra from yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) ceramic samples with multiple elastic moduli, even when the spectra had missing frequencies.\n\nOverall, the modulated fingerprint method offers a more efficient and accurate approach to predicting elastic moduli from RUS spectra, compared to traditional methods that rely on user intervention and published analysis codes."
