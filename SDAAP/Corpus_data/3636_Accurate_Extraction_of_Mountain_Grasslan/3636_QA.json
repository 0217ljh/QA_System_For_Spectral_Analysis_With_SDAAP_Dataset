        "Output": "The developed composite multifeature deep learning method of capsule network outperforms traditional methods such as SVM, random forest, and artificial neural network in terms of grassland extraction and classification accuracy in the remote sensing recognition of mountainous grassland in the Tangbula grassland area in Xinjiang, China. \n\nUsing the new method, the accuracy of the grassland and overall classifications reached the highest values of 91.60% and 96.13%, respectively. This is greater than the accuracy values of 85.58% and 92.18%, respectively, achieved by normal classifications without input from texture and topographic features. \n\nTherefore, the developed method is more effective and accurate in identifying and classifying the grassland in the remote sensing images compared to the traditional methods mentioned."
