        "input": "",
        "Output": "The SVR model outperforms the PLSR model in terms of accuracy and precision for determining the concentrations of five main elements (Si, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Al) in sedimentary rock samples using LIBS. The SVR model demonstrated more satisfactory accuracy and precision under the optimized conditions. The accuracy, measured by the average relative standard deviations (RSDs), was significantly enhanced by up to 43.50 times compared to the PLSR model. Additionally, the precision, measured by the root mean square error (RMSE), was improved by 7.19 times for the SVR model. This improvement in accuracy and precision can be attributed to the elimination of self-absorption of plasma efficiently by the SVR model, which is not achieved by the linear machine learning method PLSR. Therefore, the chemometric method of SVR is successfully applied for the quantitative analysis of complex geological samples using the LIBS technique."
