        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study for sample classification accuracy is the overall accuracy. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. In the related study, the overall accuracy was reported to be 100% for samples with 0.1 wt% of PVP using the quadratic support vector machines (SVM) algorithm. This indicates that all samples with this concentration of PVP were correctly classified. "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of sample classification using Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and multivariate analysis in polymeric blends with low concentrations of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) in a poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix is reported to be 100% in the related study. The related study utilized FTIR spectra obtained from thick films of PVA/PVP blends with PVP concentrations below 3% (wt./wt.). The FTIR spectra were analyzed using simple algorithms for sample classification, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM). By selecting the appropriate spectral range and number of principal components (PCs), the quadratic SVM algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 100% in classifying samples with 0.1 wt% of PVP. This suggests that FTIR combined with multivariate analysis can be a reliable method for sample classification even at low concentration changes in polymeric blends."
