        "Output": "The proposed sorting procedure utilizes mid-wavelength infrared (MIR) technology and a cautious machine learning procedure to optimize recycling in industrial sorting by overcoming the limitations of near infrared (NIR) technology and improving the accuracy of sorting dark plastics commonly found in Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE). \n\nThe MIR technology is able to discriminate between different types of plastics, including dark plastics, which NIR technology struggles with. However, the MIR spectral range is poorer in terms of wavelength for some plastics, making the sorting task more challenging. \n\nTo address this challenge, a cautious machine learning procedure is employed, taking advantage of the belief functions theory. When the information provided by the MIR device is insufficient to accurately identify a plastic fragment, the procedure blows the fragment into a container dedicated to more than one specific material. This cautious sorting approach ensures that the containers dedicated to specific materials contain fewer impurities, resulting in higher-quality secondary raw materials.\n\nBy combining MIR technology with a cautious machine learning procedure, the proposed sorting procedure optimizes recycling by minimizing sorting errors, avoiding recycling problems, and reducing the degradation of the final recycled product. This ultimately leads to higher-quality secondary raw materials and improved recycling outcomes in industrial sorting."

MIR technology is used instead of near infrared (NIR) technology to overcome the limitations of NIR in detecting dark plastics.\n\nThe MIR technology, although poorer in terms of wavelength for some plastics of interest, is combined with a cautious machine learning procedure.

Improved sorting accuracy: By combining MIR technology and cautious machine learning, the sorting process becomes more reliable and accurate. This minimizes sorting errors and reduces the risk of recycling problems and quality degradation of the final recycled product.\n\n2. Higher-quality secondary raw materials: The cautious sorting procedure ensures that containers dedicated to specific materials contain fewer impurities.
