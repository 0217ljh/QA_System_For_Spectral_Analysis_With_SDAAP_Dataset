        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of object-based (OB) approaches with the 15 m L8 panchromatic band can be considered superior to pixel-based (PB) approaches in the development of the Landsat 8 data composition and classification process for creating a detailed Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) map of the Maiella National Park in central Italy. The related study states that the OB approaches performed better than the PB ones when using the 15 m L8 panchromatic band. By integrating the panchromatic band within the OB approach, a detailed, 15-m resolution LULC map of the study area was produced. Therefore, the OB approaches with the panchromatic band can be considered superior for this purpose."
