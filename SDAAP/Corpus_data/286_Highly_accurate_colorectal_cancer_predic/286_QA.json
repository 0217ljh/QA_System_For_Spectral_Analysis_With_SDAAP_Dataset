        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the CRC prediction model is the R-2 value. The R-2 value, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (CRC prediction) that can be explained by the independent variables (Raman spectral data). \n\nThe R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit of the model to the data. In the past study, the R-2 values for CRC, adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, and neuroendocrine tumors were reported as 0.9982, 0.9630, 0.9962, and 0.9986, respectively. \n\nA high R-2 value indicates that the model is able to accurately predict the presence of CRC and other specific diseases based on the Raman spectral data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models were used to develop a boosted tree CRC prediction model based on the recorded Raman spectra. The Raman spectra were used as training data for the machine learning algorithm. The model was constructed using the R-2 values, which indicate the accuracy of the prediction. The R-2 values for CRC, adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, and neuroendocrine tumors were calculated, and the model achieved high R-2 values for each of these conditions. This indicates that the machine learning model was able to accurately predict the presence of CRC based on the Raman spectral data."
