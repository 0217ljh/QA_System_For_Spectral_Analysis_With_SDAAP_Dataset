        "Output": "In the research, the metric chosen to estimate forest height was the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE was used to evaluate the accuracy of various feature selection and machine learning methods in estimating forest height using AISA hyperspectral bands and airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) height metrics, both alone and combined. The RMSE values obtained from the best performing models were 1.7 m for the combination of Boruta feature selection and extreme gradient boosting with trees (XGBdart) classifier, and 1.8 m for the combination of Boruta feature selection and support vector regression (SVR) classifier."

This means that the model explained 53% of the variance in the forest height data and had an average error of 1.7 m in its predictions. The nRMSE value was 18.4% and the bias was 0.046 m.\n\nSimilarly, when using the combination of BO-SVR and lidar and hyperspectral data, the model achieved an R-2 value of 0.51 and an RMSE of 1.8 m. This means that the model explained 51% of the variance in the forest height data and had an average error of 1.8 m in its predictions. The nRMSE value was 15.8% and the bias was -0.244 m."
