        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study was the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between the spectral reflectance data and the concentration of various nutrients in the rice leaves. The correlation coefficient values during calibration and validation of the optimized indices ranged from 0.34 to 0.63 and 0.36 to 0.66, respectively. \n\nThe correlation coefficient can provide information about the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. In the related study, it was used to assess the relationship between the spectral reflectance data and the nutrient concentrations in the rice leaves."
