        "Output": "The metric chosen to select the characteristic number in the study was the cumulative variance interpretation rate. This metric measures the proportion of variance in the data that is explained by the selected number of characteristics. By selecting the appropriate characteristic number based on the cumulative variance interpretation rate, the researchers were able to effectively identify Bachu mushrooms.\n\nThe study found that the cumulative variance interpretation rate can be used to select the characteristic number and achieve accurate identification of Bachu mushrooms. The classification results showed that the accuracy of identifying Bachu mushrooms based on the caps data was 99.06%, and based on the stalks data was 99.82%. This indicates that the selected characteristic number, determined by the cumulative variance interpretation rate, was successful in distinguishing Bachu mushrooms from other types of edible fungi. Therefore, this metric has proven to be effective in identifying Bachu mushrooms and can be used as a reliable method in future applications."

The overall steps of data processing involved using partial least squares (PLS) to extract spectral features, selecting the appropriate characteristic number, and using different classification algorithms for classification.\n\nThe classification algorithms used in the study were the support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. These algorithms were applied to the spectral data obtained from the caps and stalks of Bachu mushrooms, as well as two other types of common edible mushrooms (Lentinus edodes and club fungi) that were selected and classified alongside Bachu mushrooms.\n\nTo determine the best algorithm, the classification results of the three algorithms were compared. It was found that the classification effect of the KNN algorithm was the best. The accuracy of the classification results for the caps data was 99.06%, and for the stalks data, it was 99.82%.\n\nThe machine learning models were trained on the spectral data and used the extracted spectral features to classify and identify the different types of fungi.

The study found differences in the infrared spectra of the caps and stalks of Bachu mushrooms, Lentinus edodes, and club fungi, indicating that the infrared spectra can be used to classify and identify these fungi. Machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), were used to process the spectral data and achieved good results in the multivariate classification of the caps and stalks data.
