        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed river turbidity measurement model based on random forest ensemble utilizes each spectral information and their tuned spectral information by deploying a newly proposed full combination subspace. This subspace is designed to generate all possible base random forests by fully taking advantage of each spectral information. Additionally, the model introduces a novel error-minimization-based pruning algorithm to circularly delete poor base random forests based on a dynamic threshold. This ensures that only the most relevant and accurate base random forests are preserved. The remaining base random forests are then aggregated using a weighted average method solved by regularized linear regression, resulting in the final measurement result of river turbidity."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed river turbidity measurement model based on random forest ensemble using hyperspectral remote sensing data from GEE can be considered superior to traditional methods relying on sensor data or satellite data in terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness. The related study states that the traditional methods have limitations such as low-density spatial distribution of sensor data and the high price of satellite data. In contrast, the proposed model takes advantage of hyperspectral remote sensing data freely provided by GEE, which allows for a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of the river turbidity. Additionally, the model utilizes a novel error-minimization-based pruning algorithm to improve the accuracy of the measurement. The experiments mentioned in the related study confirm the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art competitors and its simplified counterparts, further supporting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness."
