RF achieved an accuracy of 60% while CNN had an accuracy of 59%.\n\nOverall, CNN achieved better accuracy than RF in the binary and 4-class models, but the accuracies were similar for the 5-class model."

Again, CNN outperformed RF in accurately classifying the different types of inclusions.\n\nFor the 5-class model, which includes specific types of inclusions such as alumina, calcium aluminates, calcium sulfides, complex calcium-manganese sulfides, and oxy-sulfide inclusions, both RF and CNN had similar accuracies. RF achieved an accuracy of 60%, while CNN achieved an accuracy of 59%.\n\nBased on these results, it can be concluded that CNN generally achieved better accuracy than RF in differentiating between inclusions and non-in"
