        "Output": "The novel method utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically k-means clustering, to classify hyper- and multi-spectral observations into optical water types (OWTs). The classification process involves training a Gaussian process (GP) regression model using the k-means clustering results. The model then performs a sensitivity analysis (SA) on the predictive mean and variance function of the GP regression model to determine the relevance of different features. This feature relevance step helps identify the most important features for classifying the observations into OWTs. The method can be used in both training and predictive mode, allowing for the automatic assessment of OWTs and relevant features for new unlabeled observations."
