        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the impact of the two composition methods and spectral-temporal metrics on the accuracy of the machine learning classifier in producing LULC maps by using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to create cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S-2) and Landsat-8 (L-8) time series over the Tehran Province (Iran) as of 2020. They defined four datasets based on satellite time series, vegetation indices, and topographic layers using two composition methods: seasonal composites and percentile metrics. The random forest classifier was then used for LULC classification and to identify the most important variables. Accuracy assessment results were obtained to compare the performance of the different methods and metrics at the overall and class level."
