        "Output": "In the research on detecting adulterants in cassava starch using Raman spectroscopy, the performance of OC-SVM (one-class support vector machine) was found to be better than SIMCA (soft independent modelling by class analogy) in the prediction of known data samples. OC-SVM achieved higher values of sensitivity (87.1%), specificity (86.8%), and accuracy (86.9%) compared to SIMCA. Additionally, OC-SVM was able to detect adulterations over 2%, while SIMCA could only detect adulterations over 5%."
