        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in the related study was Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). \n\nThe SVR model performed the best among the machine learning models, with an MAE of 0.0056%, RMSE of 0.620%, and R2 of 0.627 at the test data sets. This indicates that the SVR model had the smallest average absolute difference between the predicted and actual SOC content, the smallest average squared difference between the predicted and actual SOC content, and the highest proportion of the variance in the SOC content explained by the model. \n\nIn the arable and permanent agriculture soils, the SVR model also yielded good results. In scenario II, the MAE was 0.0042%, RMSE was 0.672%, and R2 was 0.574. In scenario III, the MAE was 0.0032%, RMSE was 0.342%, and R2 was 0.381. These results indicate that the SVR model performed well in predicting SOC content in different types of agriculture soils."

        "Output": "The study demonstrated the potential of combining remote sensing data and various methods to improve the accuracy of predicting SOC content in agriculture soils by employing machine learning models. The researchers used spectral indices extracted from different satellite images, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and MODIS, in three different scenarios. They compared the performance of three machine learning models - artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and genetic expression programming (GEP) - in estimating SOC content.\n\nThe results showed that the SVR model had the best performance in predicting SOC content, with low mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and high coefficient of determination (R2) values. The SVR model performed particularly well when using remote sensing information extracted from the integration of Landsat-8-MODIS and Sentinel-2-Sentinel-3 images (Scenario II) for all sampled data. Additionally, the SVR model yielded better results in arable and permanent agriculture soils when using remote sensing information from Scenario II and Scenario III, respectively."
