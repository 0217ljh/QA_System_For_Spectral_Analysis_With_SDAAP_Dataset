        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the SAE-ELM model for predicting apple firmness is the determination coefficient. The determination coefficient is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (apple firmness) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral data). \n\nIn this case, the determination coefficient of the SAE-ELM model for the prediction set increased from 0.7345 to 0.7703 compared to the traditional ELM model. This indicates that the SAE-ELM model is able to explain a higher proportion of the variance in apple firmness using the spectral data. \n\nThe determination coefficient can range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the model's predictions and the actual values. In this study, the SAE-ELM model achieved a determination coefficient of 0.7703, which suggests a reasonably good fit for predicting apple firmness."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the SAE-ELM model, which uses spectral data extracted from hyperspectral images, is superior to that of traditional methods in predicting apple firmness. The determination coefficient of the prediction set increases from 0.7345 to 0.7703, indicating a better fit of the model to the data. Additionally, the SAE-ELM residual prediction bias increases from 1.968 to 2.116, suggesting improved accuracy in predicting apple firmness. Furthermore, the square root error of the prediction set decreases from 1.6297 to 1.2837, indicating reduced prediction errors. These results demonstrate that the SAE-ELM model outperforms traditional methods in predicting apple firmness."
