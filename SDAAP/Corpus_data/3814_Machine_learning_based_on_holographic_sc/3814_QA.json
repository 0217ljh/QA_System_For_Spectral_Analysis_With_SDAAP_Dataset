This technology captures the unique spectral signatures of different pollutants, enabling their identification and characterization.\n\nThe CNN, on the other hand, is a machine learning algorithm that has shown remarkable success in various fields, including image recognition. By training the CNN model with sufficient data, it can learn to recognize and classify different pollutants based on their spectral information.\n\nBy combining holographic spectrum and CNN, the research aims to achieve rapid and accurate detection of mixed pollutants. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor involved in traditional pollutant analysis methods but also provides a more efficient and intelligent solution for studying complex chemical systems."
