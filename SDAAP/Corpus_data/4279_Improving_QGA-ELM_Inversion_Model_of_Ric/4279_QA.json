The study reports that the determination coefficient of the correction set and prediction set (RC-C-2 and RP-P-2) were 0.6496 and 0.6814, respectively. This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the LAI that can be explained by the spectral indices used in the models. "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, the QGA-ELM (Quantum Genetic Algorithm-Extreme Learning Machine) and LS-SVM (Least Squares Support Vector Machine) algorithms were used in combination with UAV remote sensing images to build a large-scale fast inversion modeling of LAI (Leaf Area Index) in crops.\n\nFirst, linear and nonlinear models were constructed to compare the correlation between six spectral indices and LAI, categorized by nitrogen level. The traditional linear model was then replaced by the LS-SVM model, which improved the determination coefficient of the correction set and prediction set. The determination coefficients ((RC)-C-2 and (RP)-P-2) were found to be 0.6496 and 0.6814, respectively. Additionally, the root mean square error of the correction set and prediction set (RMSEC and RMSEP) were 0.5702 and 0.6842, respectively.\n\nHowever, the results showed that the inversion of edge objects in noncrop areas was not stable. To address this problem, an improvement based on the ELM and QGA with probabilistic evolution was used. This improvement aimed to overcome the issues of randomly generated hidden layer connection weight and threshold, slow regression of nonlinear data, and insufficient model generalization ability."

        "Output": "Yes, the QGA-ELM combined with LS-SVM model can be considered superior to traditional linear and nonlinear regression models in terms of stability and generalization ability for large-scale fast inversion modeling of LAI in crops using UAV remote sensing images. The results of the study showed that the QGA-ELM combined with LS-SVM model improved the stability of the model greatly and enhanced the generalization performance. It also provided a basis for LAI inversion in different varieties and accumulated temperature zones of rice. Therefore, this model can be considered more effective and reliable for large-scale fast inversion modeling of LAI in crops."
