        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed MSMCF method can be considered as a superior alternative to traditional methods for the retrieval of non-optically active water quality parameters (NAWQPs) in urban areas using hyperspectral and remote sensing technology. The method integrates both local and global spectral morphological features and employs a multi-scale approach, which enhances its applicability and stability. It provides a more accurate and robust solution compared to traditional methods. The method has been tested on measured data and three different hyperspectral datasets, demonstrating good retrieval performance and the ability to suppress noise. Therefore, the MSMCF method shows promise in the prevention and treatment of urban water quality deterioration and can be used as an effective tool for water quality assessment and management."
