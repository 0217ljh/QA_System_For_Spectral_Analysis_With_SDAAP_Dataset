        "input": "",
        "Output": "Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract features from the spectra of skin and flesh, then merged the two types of features into a new feature matrix, and finally established k-nearest neighbor (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), back propagation (BP), and support vector machine (SVM) classification models."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification results in this experiment is the accuracy and Macro-F1 score. The accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples, while the Macro-F1 score considers both precision and recall for each class and calculates the average across all classes."
