        "Output": "No. Based on the given related study, it is not mentioned whether the use of spectroscopic methods can enhance the reliability of classification results in comparing mosaic images and KOMPSAT-3 images. The related study only discusses the limitations of using mosaic images due to the distortion of spectral information and the lack of NIR band information. It suggests exploring ways to minimize spectral distortion and develop classification techniques suitable for mosaic images, as well as the provision of NIR band information."
