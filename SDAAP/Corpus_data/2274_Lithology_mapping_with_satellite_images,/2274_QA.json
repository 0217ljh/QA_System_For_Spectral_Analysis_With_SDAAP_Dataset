        "Output": "In the related study for geological mapping in mainland Portugal, two types of spectra were used: multispectral analysis and hyperspectral data. Multispectral analysis was carried out using Landsat-8 images of 2015, one in the winter and the other in the summer. Hyperspectral data were obtained using a 400-1000 nm spectroradiometer applied to 23 rock samples collected in two field campaigns."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the success rate of the machine learning algorithm in the assessment of the viability of using remote sensing, machine learning, and geochemical techniques for geological mapping in mainland Portugal is the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix provides information on the performance of a classification model by showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. In this case, the confusion matrixes showed a high success rate of 83.72% and 94.08% for the machine learning algorithm using Landsat-8 reflectance data. \n\nThe confusion matrix can provide valuable insights into the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning algorithm in classifying geological features based on remote sensing data. However, it is important to note that the confusion matrix alone does not provide a comprehensive assessment of the viability of using these techniques for geological mapping. Other factors such as the complexity of the geological formations, the availability and quality of training data, and the generalizability of the algorithm to different regions need to be considered to fully evaluate the potential of these techniques in the Portuguese context."

        "Output": "The J48 machine learning algorithm was used as part of the assessment to determine the viability of using remote sensing, machine learning, and geochemical techniques for geological mapping in mainland Portugal, specifically in the Beiras Group area. In the related study, Landsat-8 reflectance data was used as input for the J48 algorithm. The algorithm analyzed the multispectral data from two Landsat-8 images taken in different seasons (winter and summer) in 2015. By comparing the spectral differences between the two main lithological units (granites and metasediments), the J48 algorithm was able to classify and distinguish these units accurately. The success rate of the J48 algorithm was high, as indicated by the confusion matrixes, with a rate of 83.72% and 94.08% respectively. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques in conjunction with remote sensing data for geological mapping in the Beiras Group area of mainland Portugal."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The investigation assessed the viability of using remote sensing, machine learning, and geochemical techniques for geological mapping in mainland Portugal, specifically in the Beiras Group area, by conducting a proof of concept study. The study utilized multispectral analysis of Landsat-8 images from 2015, as well as hyperspectral data obtained from rock samples collected in two field campaigns in January and April 2019.\n\nThe spectral differences identified between different lithological units were significant enough to support the use of these techniques. The analysis revealed that the granites (Granito de Coentral and Granito de Vila Nova) had an increasing wavelength spectra shape throughout the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) measurements. This indicates that the spectral signatures of the granites differed from those of the metasediments.\n\nAdditionally, geochemical data obtained through X-ray Fluorescence showed that major elements such as Na2O and CaO were present in higher quantities in the granites compared to the metasediments. This further supports the differentiation between the two lithological units.\n\nFurthermore, the J48 machine learning algorithm was applied using Landsat-8 reflectance data as input. The algorithm demonstrated a high success rate in both confusion matrixes, achieving an accuracy of 83.72% and "
