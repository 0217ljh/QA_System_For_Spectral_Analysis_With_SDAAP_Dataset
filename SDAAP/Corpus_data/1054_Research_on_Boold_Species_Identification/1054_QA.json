        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method of blood species identification using RF_AdaBoost has higher classification accuracy and stronger stability compared to traditional methods. The method combines Random Forest (RF) as the weak classifier of Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) to improve identification accuracy and enhance the robustness of the model. \n\nIn the experiments conducted using different scales of blood Raman spectroscopy data, the identification accuracy of RF_AdaBoost reached 100% as the number of training samples increased. Additionally, the prediction standard deviation tended to zero, indicating high stability in the model's predictions.\n\nThe comparison with other traditional methods such as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM), Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE), Back Propagation (BP), Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCALDA), and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) showed that RF_AdaBoost outperformed them in terms of classification accuracy and stability.\n\nTherefore, the proposed method of blood species identification using RF_AdaBoost provides an effective and superior approach for accurately identifying human and non-human blood species."
