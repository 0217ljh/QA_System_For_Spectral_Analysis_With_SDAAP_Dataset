They found that the ELM model, which is based on a neural network structure, achieved the best identification results with a classification accuracy of 95.77%. This suggests that the ELM model outperformed the support vector machine model in accurately classifying and identifying the similar diseases of tea."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method of using hyperspectral images in this research is compared to traditional methods in identifying and classifying similar diseases of tea. The traditional methods have shown a low accuracy in the classification and identification of diseases using hyperspectral technology due to the similarity in disease characteristics between white star disease and anthracnose disease of tea. \n\nTo address this problem, the research proposed a spectrum extraction method based on the region of interest of the spots region. By using hyperspectral images, the average spectra of healthy leaves, white star disease, and anthrax leaves were collected. It was found that the average spectrum of white star disease and anthrax had strong morphological correlation and poor classification results.\n\nTo improve the accuracy, the mask technology was used to segment the diseased region of leaves in order to obtain the best region of interest. This significantly improved the average spectral separability of the diseased region.\n\nFurthermore, the classification results were compared between support vector machine and extreme learning machine (ELM). It was found that the ELM model based on neural network structure achieved the best identification results, with a classification accuracy of 95.77%."
