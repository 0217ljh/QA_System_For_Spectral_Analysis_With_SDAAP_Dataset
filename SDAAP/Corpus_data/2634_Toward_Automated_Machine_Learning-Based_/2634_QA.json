        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the AutoML regression model in the related research on estimating crop yield and biomass is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (crop yield and biomass) that can be explained by the independent variables (hyperspectral data and cultivation practices). The NRMSE value measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, normalized by the range of the dependent variable.\n\nThe research showed that the AutoML regression model had a significant estimated capacity. The best R-2 values achieved were 0.96 for single variety planting wheat, 0.76 for mixed peas and oats, and 0.88 for mixed legumes and spring barley. The corresponding NRMSE values were 0.12, 0.18, and 0.16 respectively. These values indicate a high level of accuracy and predictive power of the model in estimating crop yield and biomass.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metrics of R-2 and NRMSE demonstrate the effectiveness of the AutoML regression model in this research."

        "Output": "The integration of open-sourced systems (R and Python) with automated hyperspectral narrowband vegetation index calculation and AI-based automated machine learning (AutoML) technology contributes to the estimation of yield and biomass in different crop categories by providing a more efficient and accurate method for analysis. \n\nBy combining R and Python, researchers are able to leverage the strengths of both programming languages, allowing for more comprehensive data processing and computation. This integration enables the handling of extensive and redundant three-dimensional (3D) cube data generated by the airborne hyperspectral system, which is crucial for crop physiological characteristics and yield prediction.\n\nThe automated hyperspectral narrowband vegetation index calculation allows for the extraction of relevant information from the hyperspectral data, specifically related to vegetation health and growth. This calculation helps in understanding the physiological characteristics of crops and provides valuable insights for yield and biomass estimation.\n\nThe AI-based automated machine learning (AutoML) technology plays a significant role in this integration by automating the process of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering. This technology allows for the development of regression models that can accurately estimate yield and biomass based on the specific crop categories under study."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the integration of open-sourced systems (R and Python) with automated hyperspectral narrowband vegetation index calculation and AI-based automated machine learning (AutoML) technology can be considered superior to traditional methods for estimating crop yield and biomass in different crop categories. The study showed that the empirical AutoML regression model had a significant estimated capacity. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values obtained for different crop categories were high, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values. This suggests that the integrated approach can provide accurate estimations of crop yield and biomass. Additionally, the use of hyperspectral imaging and AI technologies allows for increased implementation flexibility and reduced learning costs, making it a more efficient and cost-effective method compared to traditional approaches."
