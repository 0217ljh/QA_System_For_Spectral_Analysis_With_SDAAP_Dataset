        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method of pharmaceutical discrimination using near infrared spectrum, called wSDAG(SM), outperforms traditional classification methods in terms of classification accuracy and stability. The experimental results showed that wSDAG(SM) achieved higher classification accuracy and stability compared to other classifiers such as wBP, wSVM, wSDAL, and wSDAG(SE). \n\nThe wSDAG(SM) network combines the sparse denoising autoencoder (SDAE) for feature extraction and dimension reduction with the Gaussian process (GP) for binary classification. The SDAE network has a strong ability of model representation, while the GP classifier is advantageous in dealing with small sample data. This combination allows the wSDAG(SM) network to obtain fewer dimensions and more valuable features, leading to more accurate classification of spectral data.\n\nAdditionally, the wSDAG(SM) network utilizes the spectral mixture (SM) kernel function as the covariance function of the GP. The SM kernel function has a good expression and is well-suited for representing the covariance structure of the spectral data. This further enhances the accuracy of classification."
