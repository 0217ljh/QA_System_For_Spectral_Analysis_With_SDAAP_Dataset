        "input": "",
        "Output": "The random forest classifier was used in the second step of the batch-level analysis methodology for assessing meibum health quality in hsSRS data sets. In this step, the classifier was employed to rapidly classify hsSRS stacks based on the pre-determined basis set of chemically meaningful reference spectra. By using the random forest classifier, the analysis could quickly and accurately determine the composition of lipid and protein mixtures in the meibum samples. This allowed for a quantitative analysis of large hsSRS data sets and enabled a direct comparison among samples using a single set of reference spectra."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly stated whether the developed methodology for batch-level analysis of hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (hsSRS) data sets can be used to assess meibum health quality in other biological samples. The text only mentions the application of the methodology to assess 50 specimens of expressed human meibum and the potential correlation between the variation among samples and meibum health quality. Therefore, it is unclear whether the methodology can be directly applied to other biological samples for assessing their health quality."
