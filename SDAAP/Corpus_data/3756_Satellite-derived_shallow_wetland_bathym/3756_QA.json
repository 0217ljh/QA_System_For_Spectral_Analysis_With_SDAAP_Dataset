        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning algorithms were utilized to obtain shallow wetland bathymetry. Four algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), were selected for this purpose. These algorithms were used in conjunction with remote sensing techniques to analyze spectral reflections obtained at different water depths from field study and satellite images. The algorithms used training samples/datasets to classify the spectral data and determine the water surface areas. The classification accuracy of the algorithms was directly related to the selection of training data. Two different training datasets were used to investigate the effect of pixel counts on classification accuracy. The accuracy of the algorithms was assessed by comparing the water surface areas obtained from the algorithms with a bathymetric map and Normalized Difference Water Index. The results showed that the best accuracy was achieved with the random forest (RF) algorithm. Additionally, it was observed that the number of training data influenced the accuracy, with the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) algorithms performing the best when trained with datasets containing more pixels."
