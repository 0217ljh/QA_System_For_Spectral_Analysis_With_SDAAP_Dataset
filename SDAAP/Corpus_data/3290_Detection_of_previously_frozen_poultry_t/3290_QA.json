        "Output": "The researchers determined the most suitable multivariate analysis method by evaluating the amount of data required to build an accurate model, computational speed, and the robustness of the model. They used machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM) to analyze the pixel spectra of chicken thighs. They created data subsets with different percentages of pixel spectra for both the training and test data sets to evaluate how the amount of data influenced computational time. After comparing the performance of these algorithms, logistic regression was found to be the best algorithm for detecting poultry thawed from frozen with and without plastic lidding film, considering its accuracy, sensitivity, and computational efficiency."
