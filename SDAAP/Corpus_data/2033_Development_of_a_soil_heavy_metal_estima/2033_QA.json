By applying FOD with different orders (ranging from 0 to 2 with intervals of 0.25), the researchers were able to effectively address the collinearity and redundancy issues present in hyperspectral datasets. The results showed that FOD with an order of 0.75 yielded the best model performance for estimating chromium (Cr) and zinc (Zn), with R-P(2) values of 0.74 and 0.81, respectively. For lead (Pb), the highest estimation accuracy was achieved with a 0.5-order reflectance, resulting in an R(P)(2) value of 0.56.\n\nAdditionally, a new three-band spectral index was developed to select characteristic bands for the estimation of heavy metals. This index took into account the electronic transition of metal ions in the visible region and the presence of organic matter and clay minerals in the near-infrared region.
