The study specifically focuses on comparing three methods (SVMs, GPs, and SAM) and their performance in the context of open pit mines. \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the study does highlight the advantages of using Bayesian machine-learning methods and non-stationary kernels (such as GPs and the OAD kernel) for classification of hyperspectral data in the field. These findings suggest that these methods may have potential for application in other contexts beyond open pit mines. \n\nTo determine the generalizability of the results to other applications, further research and experimentation would be necessary."
