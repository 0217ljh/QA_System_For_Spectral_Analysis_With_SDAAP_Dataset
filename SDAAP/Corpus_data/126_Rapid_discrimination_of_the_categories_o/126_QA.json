        "Output": "The laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) coupled with chemometrics methods was found to be effective in discriminating biomass pellets and selecting the category with better combustion performance. Past study used various chemometrics methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Discrimination Analysis (PLS-DA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to quantitatively distinguish biomass pellets. Among these methods, the RBFNN model showed a reliable discrimination power, achieving an average recognition accuracy of 100% in the calibration set and 96.88% in the prediction set. The results also demonstrated that LIBS combined with chemometrics methods could accurately distinguish rice husk, which has relatively poor combustion performance, from wood biomass pellets. Therefore, the study concluded that LIBS coupled with chemometrics methods could be a novel and reliable approach for discriminating biomass pellets and selecting the category with better combustion performance."
