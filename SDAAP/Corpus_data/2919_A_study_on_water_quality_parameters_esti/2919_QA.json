The research explores the feasibility of using hyperspectral monitoring technology as an alternative to laboratory tests. By utilizing hyperspectral data and various modeling techniques such as partial least squares (PLS), random forest (RF), and Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), the research constructs fitting models for six water quality parameters. These models are tested and evaluated using the hyperspectral data. The results show that different spectral transformation methods have different inversion effects, highlighting the potential of hyperspectral monitoring technology for water quality monitoring. Additionally, the machine learning algorithms of RF and Lasso are found to have the best prediction models for different water quality parameters, indicating the advantages of these methods over traditional regression models. Overall, the research suggests that the use of hyperspectral monitoring technology and machine learning algorithms can provide a more convenient, economical, and extensive method for water quality monitoring in urban internal rivers compared to traditional laboratory tests."
