        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of Chl-a retrieval in the related study is the Coefficient of Determination (R-2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the Chl-a concentration that can be explained by the model, with a higher value indicating a better fit. The RMSE value represents the average difference between the predicted Chl-a concentration and the actual measured values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy.\n\nIn terms of performance, the R-2 value obtained using the XGBoost(FD-FI) model was 0.8351, indicating that the model can explain approximately 83.51% of the variance in the Chl-a concentration. The RMSE value for this model was 6.6477 mu g/L, which represents the average difference between the predicted and actual Chl-a concentrations.\n\nWhen combined with the MixModel, the FD-FI strategy further improved the accuracy of Chl-a retrieval, with an R-2 value of 0.8664 and an RMSE value of 5.7926 mu g/L."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed feature bands selection strategy (FD-FI) based on knee-point-detection and variance inflation factor (VIF) effectively eliminates multicollinearity between bands or band combinations. This helps to enhance the data-driven retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration from hyperspectral data in water bodies. By selecting feature bands with low VIF values (<7), the strategy reduces the interference caused by multicollinearity.\n\nIn addition, the study combines nine machine learning algorithms to construct a MixModel, which is a model-driven approach. This MixModel, when compared to other models, shows higher accuracy in Chl-a concentration retrieval. The model-driven approach helps to improve the inversion accuracy by utilizing the capabilities of different machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe results of the study demonstrate that the FD-FI strategy, when combined with the MixModel, further improves the accuracy of Chl-a retrieval. The MixModel, in particular, shows better performance in terms of Coefficient of Determination (R-2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The R-2 value of the MixModel is 0.8664, and the RMSE is 5.7926 mu g/L."

The study states that the FD-FI strategy can effectively eliminate multicollinearity between bands or band combinations with a variance inflation factor (VIF) of less than 7."
