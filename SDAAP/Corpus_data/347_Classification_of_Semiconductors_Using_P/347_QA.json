The past study mentions that machine learning, specifically neural networks, were used to construct an algorithm that has a high accuracy (>90%) for assigning a substance to one of the six categories based on its photoluminescence spectrum. This suggests that the machine learning approach is efficient and effective in making classifications, making it a superior method compared to traditional methods."
