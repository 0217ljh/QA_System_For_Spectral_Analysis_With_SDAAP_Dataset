        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the albedo retrieval results in the framework is the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE values for the shortwave albedo retrieval were found to be 0.094 when assessed against pyranometer data and 0.069, 0.143, and 0.085 when evaluated against albedometer data in the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave spectral ranges, respectively. The RMSE provides a measure of the average difference between the retrieved albedo values and the measured data."

        "Output": "Yes, the RTM-SciML framework for albedo retrieval can be applied to optical sensors that measure appropriate radiance data in order to improve the remote sensing of sea ice albedo. The framework integrates sea ice physics with high computational efficiency and combines a radiative transfer model (RTM) with a scientific machine learning (SciML) model. It has been trained on a large synthetic dataset and has shown excellent agreement with measurements collected from airplane campaigns. This framework does not depend on observations from multiple days and can be applied to single angular observations obtained under clear-sky conditions. It also has the advantage of being applicable to a wide variety of cryosphere surfaces, both heterogeneous and homogeneous."
