The researchers assembled a large library of commonly used industrial products in the field of cultural heritage and applied these products in different concentrations on different substrates. \n\nThey then used portable Visible Near-Infrared Fibre Optics Reflectance Spectrometry (Vis-NIR-FORS) to collect spectra from mock-up samples in the 350-2200 nm range. These spectra were then analyzed using machine learning algorithms, such as clustering, along with several statistical techniques.\n\nBy applying a multivariate, robust statistical approach, the researchers were able to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and achieve a more precise identification and localization of the products. This approach allowed them to quantify the degree of correlation among different spectra and effectively classify the considered products.\n\nFurthermore, the proposed procedure was also applied to spectra collected in situ on mural paintings, demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios. Overall, the utilization of machine learning algorithms in the study enabled a faster and more cost-effective identification and classification of modern restoration products."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of a multivariate, robust statistical approach in conjunction with Vis-NIR-FORS can be considered superior to standard micro-destructive techniques in terms of identifying and classifying modern restoration products more efficiently and cost-effectively. The study mentioned in the text demonstrates that portable Visible Near-Infrared Fibre Optics Reflectance Spectrometry (Vis-NIR-FORS) can provide information on the composition of restoration products in a shorter time and at a reduced cost compared to standard micro-destructive techniques. By applying statistical techniques and modern machine learning algorithms to the collected data, the study shows that the signal-to-noise ratio can be increased, leading to a more precise identification and localization of these products. This approach allows conservators and conservation scientists to gain valuable information without the need for destructive sampling, making it a more efficient and cost-effective method for identifying and classifying modern restoration products."
