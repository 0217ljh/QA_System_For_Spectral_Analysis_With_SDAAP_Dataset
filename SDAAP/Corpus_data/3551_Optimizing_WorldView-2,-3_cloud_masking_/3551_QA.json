        "Output": "The advantage of using a modified UNet-like convolutional neural network (CNN) compared to traditional methods for cloud detection in very high-resolution WorldView satellite imagery is the superior mapping accuracy. The CNN approach achieves a cloud predicted mapping accuracy of 81-91%, while traditional methods such as Random Forest algorithms only achieve an accuracy of 57-88%. The best performing UNet model has an overall accuracy of 95% in all regions, while the Random Forest has an overall accuracy of 89%. This demonstrates that the CNN approach is more effective in accurately detecting clouds in very high-resolution satellite imagery."
