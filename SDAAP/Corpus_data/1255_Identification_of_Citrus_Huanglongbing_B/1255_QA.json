        "input": "",
        "Output": "The CAE-ELM model outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and reliability for identifying Citrus Huanglongbing. In the experiments conducted using near infrared spectroscopy data of citrus leaves, the CAE-ELM model consistently achieved the highest classification accuracy compared to other methods, regardless of changes in the training sets. Even when the ratio of training sets to test sets was 1080/165, the CAE-ELM model achieved a classification accuracy of 100.00. This indicates that the CAE-ELM model is highly accurate in identifying Citrus Huanglongbing.\n\nFurthermore, the CAE-ELM model demonstrated good robustness and scalability. It was able to maintain high classification accuracy even with different proportions of training sets. This suggests that the CAE-ELM model is reliable and can effectively handle variations in the dataset.\n\nIn terms of running time, the CAE-ELM model trained faster than some other methods such as stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE), Contractive auto-encoder (CAE), and back propagation (BP). However, it was slower than support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and summation wavelet extreme learning machine (SWELM)."
