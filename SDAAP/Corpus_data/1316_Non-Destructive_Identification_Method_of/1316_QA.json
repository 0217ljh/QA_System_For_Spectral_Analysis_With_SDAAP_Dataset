        "Output": "In the research on the non-destructive identification of high-quality rice, three machine learning models were utilized: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\n\nKNN and RF were used for comparison and analysis. The classification accuracy of the model constructed using the full spectroscopy reached more than 80%. KNN had the worst modeling effect, while RF had a better effect. Specifically, the RF model accuracy corresponded to ACC(T) = 99.98% and ACC(p) = 89.10%.\n\nThe CNN model, on the other hand, performed the best among the three models. It was used to fuse various features, including the spectra, texture, and shape features extracted from the hyperspectral images. The CNN model achieved a training set classification accuracy (ACC(T)) of 92.96% and a prediction set classification accuracy (ACC(p)) of 89.71%. The CNN model outperformed both KNN and RF in terms of classification accuracy.\n\nOverall, the important variables of shape and spectroscopy combined with the CNN model accurately identified high-quality rice varieties. The research findings suggest that the CNN model provides better classification results compared to the other two machine learning methods."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fusion of texture and shape features with spectroscopy improves the accuracy of rice varieties identification in the research on the non-destructive identification of high-quality rice. The study collected hyperspectral images of seven representative rice varieties in China and extracted the spectra, texture, and shape features of each type of rice. \n\nTo select important wavelengths of spectral features, the study used the successive projections algorithm (SPA), competitive adaptive weighting algorithm (CARS), and their cascade method (CARS-SPA). The important variables of shape and texture features were selected using SPA. \n\nThe study then applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse the various features and build a rice varieties recognition model. The model achieved a classification accuracy of more than 80% using the full spectroscopy. \n\nHowever, the study found that the classification accuracy of the model constructed using only the important wavelengths of spectroscopy was worse than using the full spectroscopy. \n\nTo further improve the accuracy, the study combined texture and shape features with spectral features. The optimal result came from the model constructed using the important variables of shape and spectroscopy."
