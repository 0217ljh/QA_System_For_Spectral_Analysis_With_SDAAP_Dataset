        "Output": "The metric chosen as the performance measure for the IPSO-FNN model is the mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The mean squared error measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values of the coal ash content. The coefficient of determination indicates the proportion of the variance in the coal ash content that can be explained by the IPSO-FNN model.\n\nThe text does not provide specific information on how far this metric can go in predicting coal ash content. However, it states that the IPSO-FNN model has strong prediction ability and good accuracy in coal ash prediction. This suggests that the model is effective in predicting coal ash content, but the exact extent of its predictive capabilities is not mentioned."
