        "Output": "No. Based on the given related study, there is no mention of spectroscopic methods being used in the automated autism diagnosis system developed using resting state functional MRI data. The related study specifically states that power spectral densities (PSDs) of time courses corresponding to the spatial activation areas are used as input features for the machine learning system. Therefore, spectroscopic methods are not mentioned or utilized in this particular system."
