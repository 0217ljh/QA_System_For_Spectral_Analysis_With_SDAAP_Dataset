The NGBoost method is a recently developed natural gradient boosting probabilistic prediction technique that allows for more accurate and reliable calibration of the LIBS component within MarSCoDe. By using NGBoost, the models can predict the concentrations of 8 major element oxides in the form of normal distributions, providing a probabilistic approach to estimating uncertainty. This improves the overall accuracy and reliability of the LIBS calibration, ensuring more precise analysis of the Martian surface composition."

        "Output": "The NGBoost-based calibration method, used in the Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe) for elemental analysis of Martian silicate soil and rock using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), offers improved accuracy and error significance compared to traditional methods.\n\nThe NGBoost ensemble learning method, which utilizes a natural gradient boosting approach, was adopted to address the previous issue of indirect uncertainty estimation in the calibrations of other Martian LIBS. This method allows for probabilistic prediction and establishes Probabilistic Major Element Composition (PMEC) models based on NGBoost.\n\nThe PMEC models are capable of predicting the concentrations of 8 major element oxides (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3T, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O) in the form of normal distributions. These models were trained using a ground spectral repository from MarSCoDe LIBS records of various reference samples.\n\nTo optimize the robustness and performance of the models, tunable max-pooling feature extraction and cross-validation-controlled hyperparameter tuning were carried out. The models were then tested on an independent portion of the ground spectral repository and checked with LIBS spectra of onboard calibration targets from Mars.\n\nThe NGBoost-based calibration"
