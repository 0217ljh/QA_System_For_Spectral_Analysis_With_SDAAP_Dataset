The related study states that the developed method, which utilizes spectral-temporal features derived from satellite time series data and machine learning algorithms, achieved classification accuracies between 70% and 86%. The highest overall accuracy was obtained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. This indicates that the combination of spectral-temporal features and machine learning algorithms can provide more accurate results compared to traditional methods, which are often time-consuming and costly. Additionally, the related study mentions that the freely available satellite time series and ML algorithms are favorable for accurate tree species composition mapping."
