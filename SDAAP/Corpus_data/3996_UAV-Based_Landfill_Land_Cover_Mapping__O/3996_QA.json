        "Output": "Yes, the proposed open-source processing chain using UAV multispectral imagery can be applied to other complex sites for land cover mapping. The study found that the processing chain was transferable and effective in mapping the land cover of the landfill site in Hallembaye, Belgium. The study also showed that low-cost red-green-blue standard sensors were sufficient for achieving high accuracies in land cover mapping. Additionally, the study found that a spatial resolution of up to 10 cm could be used without significantly impacting the performance of the processing chain. Therefore, the proposed processing chain can be applied to other complex sites for land cover mapping with similar accuracies and spatial resolutions."
