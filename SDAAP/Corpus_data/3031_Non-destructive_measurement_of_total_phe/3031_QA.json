        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the study on developing a non-destructive and rapid measurement of phenolic compounds in plants to predict the total phenolic compounds in plants was the partial least square regression (PLSR) model. This model was applied using the spectral data obtained from hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) range of 900-2,500 nm. The performance of the model was evaluated using the R-2-values, which were found to be 0.97 for calibration and 0.96 for validation. The standard errors of predictions (SEP) were determined to be 0.05 and 0.07 mg/g, respectively. These results indicate that the PLSR model based on SWIR spectra can accurately predict the total phenolic compounds in plants."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of SWIR spectra in the proposed model can be considered superior to the use of VIS/NIR spectra in the non-destructive and rapid measurement of phenolic compounds in plants using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and machine learning. The related study found that the best prediction values were achieved with SWIR spectra compared to VIS/NIR spectra. Therefore, SWIR spectra were further used in the model. The results obtained with SWIR spectra were better than those obtained with the original spectra. The proposed model had a high performance with R-2-values of 0.97 and 0.96 for calibration and validation, respectively. This indicates that the model using SWIR spectra was more accurate in predicting the total phenolic compound content in plants."
