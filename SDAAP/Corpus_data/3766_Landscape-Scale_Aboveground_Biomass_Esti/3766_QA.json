        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in the related study was the R-squared value and the root mean square error (RMSE). The random forest (RF) model performed better in estimating AGB, with an R-squared value of 0.87 and a RMSE of 20.50 t ha(-1) when using the pooled dataset. When using selected important variables, the RF model achieved an R-squared value of 0.95 and a RMSE of 13.3 t ha(-1). In comparison, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model using pooled data produced an R-squared value of 0.56 and a RMSE value of 37.01 t ha(-1)."

        "Output": "In the analysis, two machine learning models, namely multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF), were utilized to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and in situ data. The analysis was conducted based on four computational procedures, which included spectral bands, vegetation indices, pooled dataset (spectral bands + vegetation indices), and model-selected important variables. The RF algorithm was found to produce better results compared to the MLR model. The RF model estimated AGB with higher accuracy, as indicated by an R-2 value of 0.87 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 20.50 t ha(-1) when using the pooled data. Additionally, the RF model selected Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation index (OSAVI), Simple ratio (SR), Modified simple ratio (MSR), and Normalized difference Vegetation index (NDVI) as the most important variables for estimating AGB. On the other hand, the MLR model selected band 5 and SR as the important variables. These machine learning models demonstrated the potential of the Landsat 8 sensor in accurately estimating AGB in community buffer zones."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The RF algorithm outperforms the MLR model in estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) using the Landsat 8 sensor in the Parsa National Park, Nepal. The RF model achieved an R-2 value of 0.87 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 20.50 t ha(-1) when using the pooled dataset, while the MLR model only achieved an R-2 value of 0.56 and an RMSE value of 37.01 t ha(-1) with the same dataset. Additionally, when using selected important variables, the RF model achieved an even higher R-2 value of 0.95 and a lower RMSE of 13.3 t ha(-1). This indicates that the RF algorithm provides more accurate estimates of AGB compared to the MLR model when using the Landsat 8 sensor in this specific location."
