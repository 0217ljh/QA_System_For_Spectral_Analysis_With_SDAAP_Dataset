        "Output": "Yes, the machine-learning-based Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy technique used in the integrated system can be considered superior to traditional methods for rapid COVID-19 screening. This is supported by the fact that the system achieved high sensitivity, specificity, and prediction accuracy of over 94% in the field test with blind testing samples. Traditional methods may not be able to provide such high levels of accuracy and efficiency in screening for COVID-19."
