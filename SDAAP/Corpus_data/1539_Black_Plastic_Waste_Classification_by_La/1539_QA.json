        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the hierarchical-partial least square-discriminant analysis (Hi-PLS-DA) classification model in the study was sensitivity and specificity. The values of sensitivity and specificity were both equal to 1, indicating excellent performance of the model in predicting the classification of black polymers. This means that the model was able to accurately identify and classify the different types of black polymers in the plastic waste stream."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The hierarchical-partial least square-discriminant analysis (Hi-PLS-DA) classification model was highly effective in optimizing polymer classification for the identification of black polymers inside a plastic waste stream using the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique. The model showed excellent performances, with sensitivity and specificity values in prediction equal to 1, indicating that it was able to accurately classify the different types of black polymers (expanded polystyrene, polystyrene, polypropylene, and high-density polyethylene). The correctness of the classification was further confirmed by the application of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on the same samples. These results demonstrate the potential of the LIF technique combined with a machine learning approach as a sorting and quality control tool for black polymers in recycling plants."
