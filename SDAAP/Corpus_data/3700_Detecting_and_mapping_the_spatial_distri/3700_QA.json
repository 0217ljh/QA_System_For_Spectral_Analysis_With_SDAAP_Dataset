        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of spectral variables and the random forest algorithm in detecting and mapping the spatial distribution of C.odorata in relation to other land use land cover classes outperforms traditional methods. The study found that the vegetation red edge and near-infrared spectral bands of the Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (MSI) sensor were the most important spectral variables for discriminating C.odorata from other land cover classes. \n\nThe random forest algorithm yielded the highest overall classification accuracy of 83%, surpassing the traditional maximum likelihood classifier, which achieved an accuracy of 75%. This indicates that the random forest algorithm is more effective in accurately classifying C.odorata's spatial distribution.\n\nOverall, the combination of freely available Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data and the machine learning random forest algorithm provides the highest accuracies for detecting the spatial distribution of C.odorata, especially in heterogeneous environments. These findings have implications for sustainable rangeland management and the implementation of site-specific mitigation approaches in areas invaded by C.odorata."
