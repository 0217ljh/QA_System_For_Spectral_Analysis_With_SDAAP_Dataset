        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy in past study was overall accuracy. The overall accuracy represents the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. In past study, the overall accuracy was reported to be 0.95 (+/- 0.03), indicating that 95% of the samples were correctly classified."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in differentiating tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissues in patients with colorectal neoplasia during colorectal surgery has shown promising results. In this ex vivo study, DRS was used to obtain spectra from tumor tissue, healthy colon or rectal wall, and fat tissue. The obtained data were then classified using a quadratic classifier and a linear support vector machine.\n\nThe past study found that when the classifiers were applied to the test set, colorectal cancer could be discriminated from healthy tissue with an overall accuracy of 0.95 (+/- 0.03). This indicates that DRS has a high classification accuracy in differentiating tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissues.\n\nCompared to traditional methods, the use of DRS offers several advantages. Firstly, it provides real-time tissue assessment during surgery, which can help overcome the challenges of the circumferential resection margin and postoperative complications. This means that surgeons can make more informed decisions during the procedure.\n\nSecondly, DRS allows for the differentiation of tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissues in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous tissues. This suggests that DRS can be effective regardless of the tissue type or composition, making it a versatile tool for tissue assessment.\n\nOverall, the use"
