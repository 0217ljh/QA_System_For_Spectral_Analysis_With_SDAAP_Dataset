        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, the machine learning models were optimized using the Cuckoo algorithm. Specifically, the particle swarm optimization least squares support vector machine model and the extreme learning machine model were optimized using the Cuckoo algorithm. The optimization process involved classifying and recognizing the original data and the fused data obtained from terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The experimental results showed that the particle swarm optimization least squares support vector machine model had the best recognition effect on the spectral feature fusion data after Hilbert transform, with an accuracy of 100%. This optimization process had significant reference significance for the identification of weight-loss drugs in forensic science."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the particle swarm optimization least squares support vector machine model used in the related study can be considered superior to traditional methods for identifying weight-loss drugs contaminated with toxic nonfood raw materials using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The experimental results showed that this model had the best recognition effect on the spectral feature fusion data after Hilbert transform, with an accuracy of 100%. This indicates that the model is highly effective in identifying weight-loss drugs and can be a valuable tool in forensic science for detecting and cracking down on criminals using the delivery channel to transport such drugs."
