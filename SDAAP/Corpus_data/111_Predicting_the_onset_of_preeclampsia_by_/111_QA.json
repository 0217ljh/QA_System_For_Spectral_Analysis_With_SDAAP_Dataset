        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for predicting preeclampsia in pregnant patients as early as the 1st trimester. Past study states that this approach enables rapid and highly sensitive maternal metabolome screening that predicts preeclampsia with over 82% accuracy. It also mentions that traditional clinical assays cannot predict preeclampsia until the late 2nd trimester, leading to poor outcomes. Therefore, the use of Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning provides an earlier and more accurate prediction of preeclampsia, making it a superior method compared to traditional approaches."
