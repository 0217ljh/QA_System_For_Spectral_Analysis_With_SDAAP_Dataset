        "Output": "In the related study, two machine learning models, namely partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), were used to detect adulterated lime juices using the miniaturized near infra-red spectrophotometer.\n\nFor the PLS-DA model, the researchers applied different spectral preprocessing techniques and found that the most accurate prediction was obtained with SNV transforming. This model was able to classify the juices with an accuracy of 88% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient value of 0.75 in the external validation set.\n\nIn the k-NN model, the researchers used multiplicative signal correction followed by 2nd-order derivative and 5th nearest neighbor. This combination resulted in the highest accuracy (88%) and Matthew's correlation coefficient (0.76) in the test set.\n\nThese machine learning models were trained using the diffuse reflectance spectra of pure lime juices and adulterated juices collected from Jahrom, Iran. The aim was to develop predictive models that could accurately classify the samples as either pure or adulterated based on their spectral characteristics.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated the potential of the handheld near infra-red spectrometer and machine learning methods for rapid detection of lime juice adulteration.

The model achieved an accuracy of 88% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient value of 0.75 in the external validation set. This indicates that the PLS-DA model with SNV transforming was the most accurate and reliable in classifying the lime juices as adulterated or pure."
