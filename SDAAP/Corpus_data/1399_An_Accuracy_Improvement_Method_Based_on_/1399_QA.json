        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the detection results in the related study was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). \n\nFor the total soluble solid content (TSSC) detection, the R-2 value was 0.8580, indicating that the model explained 85.80% of the variability in the TSSC measurements. The RMSE value was 0.4276, which represents the average difference between the predicted and actual TSSC values.\n\nFor the water content detection, the R-2 value was 0.7013, indicating that the model explained 70.13% of the variability in the water content measurements. The RMSE value was 0.0063, which represents the average difference between the predicted and actual water content values.\n\nThese metrics provide a measure of the accuracy of the detection results. The R-2 values indicate the proportion of the variability in the measurements that can be explained by the model, with higher values indicating better accuracy. The RMSE values represent the average difference between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better accuracy.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the R-2 values of 0.8580 for TSSC detection and 0.7013"
