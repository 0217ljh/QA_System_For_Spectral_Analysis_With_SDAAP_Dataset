The related study primarily focuses on the implementation and evaluation of machine learning models, such as decision trees and ensemble learning algorithms, to detect the pathogen. It does not compare or mention traditional methods of detection. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine if the machine learning method is superior to traditional methods."
