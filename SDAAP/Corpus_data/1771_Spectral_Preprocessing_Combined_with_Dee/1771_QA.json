        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study suggests that ensemble preprocessing combined with deep transfer learning outperforms conventional models in estimating chlorophyll content in different cotton varieties. The approach of using spectral preprocessing methods, specifically the combination of first-derivative (FD) and standard normal variate transformation (SNV), along with a self-designed convolutional neural network (CNN), achieved better results compared to conventional partial least squares (PLS) and squares-support vector machine regression (SVR) models. Even with a smaller dataset, the fine-tuned CNN still performed better than the conventional models and yielded satisfactory results. Therefore, the study concludes that ensemble preprocessing combined with deep transfer learning is an effective approach for estimating chlorophyll content in different cotton varieties, offering a new possibility for evaluating the nutritional status of cotton in the field."
