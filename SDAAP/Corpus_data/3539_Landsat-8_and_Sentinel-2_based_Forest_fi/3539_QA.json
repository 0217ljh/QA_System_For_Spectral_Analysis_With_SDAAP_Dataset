        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to accurately estimate the quantitative and qualitative impact of forest fires is the accuracy of the classification algorithms used to identify forest fire patches. The study employed Classification Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to identify forest fire patches. The key findings revealed that CART and RF algorithms displayed similar forest fire patches with an overall accuracy of 97-100%. However, the classification accuracy was slightly lower in SVM, and it underestimated forest fire patch detections.\n\nIn terms of how far this metric can go, it indicates the level of accuracy achieved by the classification algorithms in identifying forest fire patches. A high overall accuracy of 97-100% suggests that these algorithms are effective in accurately identifying forest fire patches."

The researchers employed unsupervised Weka clustering algorithms, as well as supervised algorithms such as Classification Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).\n\nTo begin with, the researchers used the medium resolution optical-satellite imagery of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 covering the period from 2016 to 2019. They computed differential spectral indices, including Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (dNDWI), and Short-Wave Infrared (dSWIR), by analyzing the bi-temporal (pre and post fire) reflectance contrast of burn-sensitive spectral bands.\n\nThe differential spectral indices composite was then used as input for the unsupervised Weka clustering algorithms. These algorithms helped capture the shape and pattern of fire patches in the forest. Additionally, sample training data of burn and unburn classes were collected based on thermal and optical spectral principles.\n\nFurthermore, the supervised algorithms (CART, RF, and SVM) were employed to identify forest fire patches.
