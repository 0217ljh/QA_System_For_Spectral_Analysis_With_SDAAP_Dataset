The algorithms used in the past study include:\n\n1. Decision Tree: The decision tree algorithm was used to construct multiple decision tree models by extracting different samples. This ensemble classifier technique helps reduce variance and optimize the classification model, ultimately improving classification accuracy.\n\n2. Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks. It was likely used in this past study to classify the laser ablation spots into different categories based on their spectral characteristics.\n\n3. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classification: KNN is a simple and effective classification algorithm that assigns a class label to a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors. It may have been used in this past study to classify the ablation spots based on their similarity to other spots in the dataset.\n\n4. Ensemble Classifier: The past study also employed an ensemble classifier, specifically the Bagged Trees ensemble classifier. This classifier constructs multiple decision tree models through the extraction of different samples, reducing variance and improving classification accuracy."
