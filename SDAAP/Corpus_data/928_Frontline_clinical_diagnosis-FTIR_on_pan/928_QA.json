        "Output": "Yes, the combination of infrared spectroscopy and machine learning can be considered a superior diagnostic method compared to traditional methods for pancreatic cancer in terms of accuracy and accessibility. The related study achieved a diagnosis accuracy as high as 90% using this method. Additionally, the method is non-invasive, making it more easily accessible and less burdensome for patients. Traditional methods for pancreatic cancer diagnosis may have lower accuracy rates and can be more invasive, such as biopsies or imaging techniques. Therefore, the combination of infrared spectroscopy and machine learning offers a promising alternative for accurate and accessible pancreatic cancer diagnosis."
