        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning models were utilized to estimate the content of SiO2 and TFe in iron ore tailings using visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) spectroscopy. The models used were partial least squares regression, random forest (RF), and extreme learning machine exploiting particle swarm optimization. \n\nThe outer product analysis (OPA) method was used to combine the VIS-NIR and TIR spectral domains, generating an outer product matrix of fusion data. The fusion spectra, obtained by combining the original absorbance spectra, were used as input for the machine learning models.\n\nThe prediction accuracy results showed that the RF model with input-fused spectra provided the highest accuracy. The coefficients of determination for SiO2 and TFe content estimation were 0.95 and 0.91, respectively. The root mean square errors were 0.97% and 0.96%, and the ratios of performance to interquartile distance were 6.49 and 2.31 for SiO2 and TFe, respectively."

        "Output": "The fusion of VIS-NIR and TIR spectra using the OPA method is more accurate than traditional methods for estimating the content of SiO2 and TFe in iron ore tailings. The study found that the correlation coefficients of fusion spectra improved from 0.66 to 0.87 for TFe and from 0.64 to 0.84 for SiO2, compared to the original absorbance spectra. Additionally, the prediction accuracy results showed that the prediction model with OPA-fused spectra performed significantly better than with individual VIS-NIR and TIR spectra. The RF model with input-fused spectra provided the highest accuracy, with coefficients of determination of 0.95 and 0.91, root mean square errors of 0.97% and 0.96%, and ratios of performance to interquartile distance of 6.49 and 2.31 for SiO2 and TFe content estimation, respectively. Therefore, the fusion of VIS-NIR and TIR spectra using the OPA method improves the accuracy of estimating SiO2 and TFe content in iron ore tailings compared to traditional methods."
