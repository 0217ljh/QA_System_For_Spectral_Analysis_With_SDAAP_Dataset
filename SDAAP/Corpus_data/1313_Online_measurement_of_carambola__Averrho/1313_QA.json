        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models was accuracy for the PLS-DA model and R2P, RMSEP, RPD, and RER for the PLSR models. \n\nFor the PLS-DA model, the accuracy achieved was 84.2%, indicating that the model was able to classify carambola according to maturity stage with a relatively high level of accuracy.\n\nFor the PLSR models, the R2P values for pH and moisture content were 0.78 and 0.74, respectively. R2P represents the proportion of the variance in the predicted values that can be explained by the model. These values indicate that the models were able to explain a significant portion of the variance in pH and moisture content.\n\nThe RMSEP values for pH and moisture content were 0.2 and 0.87, respectively. RMSEP represents the root mean square error of prediction, which measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values. These values indicate that the models had relatively low prediction errors for pH and moisture content.\n\nThe RPD values for pH and moisture content were 2.01 and 2.23, respectively. RPD represents the ratio of the standard deviation of the reference values to the RMSEP"

        "Output": "In the related study, the machine learning models used to classify the carambola fruit according to maturity stage were PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) and PLSR (Partial Least Squares Regression). PLS-DA was used to classify the fruit based on important variables selected by iPLS (interval partial least square), achieving an accuracy of 84.2%. \n\nFor estimating the physicochemical properties of the carambola fruit, PLSR models were used. Variable selection techniques such as iPLS and GA-PLS (Genetic Algorithm-Partial Least Squares) were employed to improve the performance of the PLSR models. The models achieved acceptable results for screening, with pH and moisture content achieving R2P (coefficient of determination for prediction) values of 0.78 and 0.74, RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) values of 0.2 and 0.87, RPD (residual predictive deviation) values of 2.01 and 2.23, and RER (relative error ratio) values of 8.02 and 10.38, respectively."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of a portable NIR spectrometer offers several advantages compared to traditional methods in determining the physicochemical properties of carambola fruit at different maturity stages. \n\nFirstly, the portable NIR spectrometer is a non-destructive technique, meaning that it does not require the fruit to be damaged or destroyed during the analysis. This is in contrast to traditional methods which often involve destructive sampling, where the fruit needs to be cut or crushed for analysis. Non-destructive analysis allows for a larger sample size and reduces waste.\n\nSecondly, the portable NIR spectrometer is a chemical-free technique. Traditional methods often involve the use of chemical reagents or solvents for analysis, which can be time-consuming and require specialized equipment. The portable NIR spectrometer eliminates the need for these chemicals, making the analysis quicker and more cost-effective.\n\nAdditionally, the portable NIR spectrometer provides a rapid analysis of multiple physicochemical properties simultaneously. In this study, the spectrometer was used to determine the colour, total soluble solids, ascorbic acid, moisture, pH, and titratable acidity of the carambola fruit. Traditional methods would require separate analyses for each property, increasing the time and resources needed for analysis.\n\nFurthermore, the portable NIR spectrometer, in combination with chem"
