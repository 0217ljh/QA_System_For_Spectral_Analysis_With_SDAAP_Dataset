        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral observations from VIIRS on board SNPP can be used to train Random Forest (RF) machine learning models for cloud mask and cloud thermodynamic-phase detection. Two RF models were trained using a 4-year collocated VIIRS and CALIOP dataset from 2013 to 2016. The models were trained for all-day and daytime-only conditions, using different bands of infrared (IR), Near-IR (NIR), and Shortwave-IR (SWIR) observations from VIIRS.\n\nWhen comparing the performance of these RF models to existing cloud mask and phase products from SNPP VIIRS and Aqua MODIS, the results show that the two RF models, along with the MODIS MYD06 optical property phase product, are the top three algorithms with respect to lidar observations during the daytime. The RF models have high accuracy rates in comparison to the CALIOP reference for both cloud detection and thermodynamic phase, especially when using a conservative screening process that excludes challenging cloudy pixels for passive remote sensing.\n\nDuring the nighttime, the RF all-day model performs best for both cloud detection and phase, particularly for pixels over snow and ice surfaces."
