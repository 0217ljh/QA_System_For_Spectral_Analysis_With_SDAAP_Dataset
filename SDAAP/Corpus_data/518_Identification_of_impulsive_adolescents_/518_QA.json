These models were trained with multi-domain features, including clinical interviews, fNIRS-derived biomarkers, and neuropsychiatric test measures. The Wrapper method was adapted to identify informative biomarkers in each domain. The models were tested using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, with 10 runs conducted for 7 different combinations of the 3-domain feature set. The classification accuracies of each algorithm were computed, and both SVM and ANN achieved diagnostic accuracies above 90%. SVM performed significantly higher than ANN in terms of the accuracy metric (92.2% and 90.16%, respectively)."
