        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for mapping old and new landslides in forest areas was object-oriented random forest classification. Its accuracy was satisfactory for discriminating landslide-affected objects from non-landslide-affected objects, with a higher performance in protected forests dominated by old landslides compared to non-protected forests dominated by new landslides."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the object-oriented random forest method using Sentinel-derived features and DEM derivatives can be considered superior to traditional methods for mapping old and new landslides in forest areas. The study conducted in northeast Iran tested the efficiency of this method and found that it had a sensitivity of 86.6% for mapping historical landslides in protected forests and 80.3% in non-protected forests. Additionally, the object features derived from Sentinel-2A and DEM obtained the highest importance in both protected and non-protected forests. The combination of Sentinel-1 and -2A features demonstrated a total importance of 10% for mapping new landslides. Therefore, the results suggest that this method can be effective in mapping both old and new landslides in forest areas."
