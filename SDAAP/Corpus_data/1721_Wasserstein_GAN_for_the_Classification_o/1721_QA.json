        "Output": "To address the challenge of classifying spectral data due to the difficulty in collecting multi-material equilibrium spectral data, the spectral feature processing methods used were S-G filtering and cubic spline interpolation. These methods were employed to normalize the spectral data of the three substances (maltose compounds) before expanding the unbalanced terahertz spectral data using the WGAN model."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In their research on the unbalanced terahertz spectrum recognition method based on WGAN, the researchers compared the WGAN method with traditional methods for processing unbalanced data sets, namely FWSVM (Fuzzy Weighted Support Vector Machine) and COPY (Class Overlapping Proportionate Yield). They compared the training set accuracy and the accuracy on the test set of the three classification algorithms (WGAN, FWSVM, and COPY) using dataset-1. They found that the training set accuracy of all three algorithms on dataset-1 was more than 90%. However, the traditional methods (FWSVM and COPY) had limited generalization ability, resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy on the test set. On the other hand, the accuracy of the test set after using the WGAN method was 91.54%, which was higher than the traditional methods. This comparison demonstrated that the WGAN method was more effective in processing unbalanced data sets for terahertz spectrum recognition."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed terahertz spectrum recognition method based on WGAN outperformed traditional methods in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in classifying terahertz spectral data. The experimental results showed that training the SVM model using the extended WGAN data set improved the accuracy of identifying unbalanced spectral data. The accuracy rates on the test sets were 91.54% for dataset-1 and ranged from 90.27% to 92.08% for different imbalances. In comparison, traditional methods such as FWSVM and COPY had lower accuracy rates on the test set and were not as effective in handling unbalanced data sets. Therefore, the WGAN-based method proved to be more accurate and effective in classifying terahertz spectral data compared to traditional methods."
