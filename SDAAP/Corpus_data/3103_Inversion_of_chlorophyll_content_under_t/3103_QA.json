        "Output": "Yes, the proposed method using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm extreme learning machine can be used to estimate leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD) under leaf mite infestation in jujube trees. The related study suggests that the PSO-ELM model for remote sensing estimation of relative leaf chlorophyll content of jujube shows high fault tolerance and improved data-processing efficiency. The accuracy of the optimized PSO-ELM model was found to be superior to that of the ELM model alone. Therefore, this method can be utilized for monitoring leaf mite infestation in jujube trees."
