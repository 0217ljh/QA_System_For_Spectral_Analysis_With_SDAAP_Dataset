        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, near-infrared hyperspectral imaging coupled with machine learning methods can be considered a superior alternative to traditional methods for rapidly detecting the storage years of black tea. The study mentioned in the text used this combination of techniques to successfully identify the storage year of black tea samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualize the differences in tea samples stored for different years, and machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and CNN-LSTM were used to establish classification models. The results showed that both conventional machine learning methods and deep learning methods achieved close results, with deep learning methods performing better. This demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of using machine learning methods for black tea quality inspection."
