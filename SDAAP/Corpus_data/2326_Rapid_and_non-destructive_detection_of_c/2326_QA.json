        "input": "",
        "Output": "Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to predict chicken adulteration in minced beef. Three spectral profiles, R, A, and KM, were compared to find the best spectra. Optimum wavelengths were selected to design a multispectral imaging system for predicting adulteration in minced beef."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of VNIR hyperspectral imaging and machine learning can be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting adulteration in fresh minced beef with chicken. The study evaluated the potential of this combination and found that it achieved high accuracy in detecting and quantifying the amount of chicken adulterant added to the minced beef. The developed models using hyperspectral imaging and machine learning had a coefficient of determination (R-p(2)) of 0.97, 0.97, and 0.96 with root mean square error in prediction (RMSEP) of 2.62, 2.45, and 3.18% (w/w) for different spectral profiles. This indicates that the combination of VNIR hyperspectral imaging and machine learning can provide reliable and precise results for detecting adulteration in minced beef with chicken."
