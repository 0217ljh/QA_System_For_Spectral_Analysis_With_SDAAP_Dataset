        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations was the determination coefficient (R2) and the root-mean-square-error (RMSE). The results showed that the machine learning model using the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) technique performed better than the other models. The GOCI-II-based schemes 2 and 3 had an R2 value of 0.85 and an RMSE value of 7.69 and 7.82 \u6e2dg/m3, respectively. The GOCI-I-based scheme 1 had an R2 value of 0.83 and an RMSE value of 8.49 \u6e2dg/m3. Therefore, the machine learning models performed reasonably well in estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, with the GOCI-II-based schemes showing slightly better performance than the GOCI-I-based scheme."

        "Output": "Based on the results of the related study, the use of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data from geostationary satellite sensors can be considered a superior approach compared to traditional methods for estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The study used machine learning techniques to directly estimate PM2.5 concentrations over South Korea using TOA reflectance data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager I (GOCI-I) and its next generation GOCI-II. The results showed that the ML models, particularly the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), performed better than other traditional methods. \n\nThe GOCI-II-based schemes, which had improved spatial resolution, performed slightly better than the GOCI-I-based scheme. The use of TOA reflectance data, instead of commonly used aerosol products, also reduced the missing rate of estimated PM2.5 concentrations by up to 50%. Additionally, the GOCI-II-based models produced a more detailed spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations. \n\nTherefore, based on these findings, the use of TOA reflectance data from geostationary satellite sensors can be considered a superior approach for estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, especially for operational purposes."
