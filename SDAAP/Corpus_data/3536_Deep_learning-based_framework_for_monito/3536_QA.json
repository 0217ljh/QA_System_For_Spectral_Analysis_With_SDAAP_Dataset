        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture addresses the challenges of network structure, labeled data, and data imbalance in training deep learning models for computer vision tasks in the following ways:\n\n1. Network Structure: The proposed architecture incorporates both spatial and spectral information by combining two sub-networks: spatial-CNN and spectral-CNN. The spatial-CNN captures spatial information, while the spectral-CNN extracts spectral information. This combination allows the network to leverage both types of information, improving the overall performance of the model.\n\n2. Labeled Data: Training a deep learning model requires a large amount of labeled data. To address this challenge, the proposed model utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate data for the underrepresented class. This helps to balance the available labeled data for different classes of interest, improving the model's accuracy.\n\n3. Data Imbalance: Imbalance among available labeled data for different classes can adversely affect the model's accuracy. The proposed model tackles this issue by using a GAN to generate data for the underrepresented class, as mentioned earlier. By generating synthetic data, the model can learn from a more balanced dataset, reducing the impact of data imbalance on the model's performance."
