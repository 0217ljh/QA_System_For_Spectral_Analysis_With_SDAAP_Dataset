        "input": "",
        "Output": "The purpose of using a hybrid framework that combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in the study is to improve the accuracy of determining tumor boundaries during brain cancer resection. By incorporating both supervised and unsupervised techniques, the algorithm aims to leverage the strengths of each approach to overcome the challenges of accurately identifying tumor boundaries in real-time during surgery. The supervised pixel-wise classification using a Support Vector Machine classifier helps to provide initial classification information based on known tumor characteristics. This information is then spatially homogenized and filtered using dimensionality reduction and K-Nearest Neighbors filtering. Additionally, the unsupervised clustering employing a Hierarchical K-Means algorithm helps to segment the image and identify clusters that may correspond to tumor regions. The fusion of information from both approaches using a majority voting approach further enhances the accuracy of the final classification maps. Overall, the hybrid framework aims to provide neurosurgeons with a more efficient and reliable tool for accurately determining tumor boundaries during brain cancer resection, thereby improving patient outcomes."
