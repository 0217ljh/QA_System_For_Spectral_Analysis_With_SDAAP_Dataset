        "Output": "The metric chosen to automatically detect insect damaged beans in coffee was the accuracy rate, which measures the percentage of correctly classified insect damaged beans. The results showed that with only three selected bands, the algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 90%. This indicates that the algorithm is highly effective in accurately identifying insect damaged beans. Therefore, the chosen metric of accuracy demonstrates the success of the hyperspectral insect damage detection algorithm (HIDDA) in detecting and classifying insect damaged beans."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of a push-broom visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) hyperspectral sensor in developing the HIDDA algorithm provides an advantage over traditional methods in terms of detecting insect damaged beans in coffee. \n\nTraditionally, coffee beans were manually screened, which could lead to misrecognition due to eye strain. However, the HIDDA algorithm, developed using the VIS-NIR hyperspectral sensor, allows for automatic detection of insect damaged beans using only a few bands and one spectral signature. \n\nBy utilizing band selection methods such as constrained energy minimization-constrained band dependence minimization (CEM-BDM), minimum variance band prioritization (MinV-BP), maximal variance-based bp (MaxV-BP), sequential forward CTBS (SF-CTBS), sequential backward CTBS (SB-CTBS), and principal component analysis (PCA), the algorithm selects the most relevant bands for accurate detection. \n\nFurthermore, the HIDDA algorithm incorporates two classifier methods: one combining CEM with support vector machine (SVM) and the other using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning for classification. These methods enhance the accuracy of detecting insect damaged beans."
