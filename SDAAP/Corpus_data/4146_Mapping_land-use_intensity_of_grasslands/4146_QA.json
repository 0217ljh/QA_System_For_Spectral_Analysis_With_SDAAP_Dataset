        "input": "",
        "Output": "The continuous LUI index was calculated using a framework enabling large-scale LUI mapping. The accuracy of this metric in depicting LUI may be limited by the sensitivity of the models to the selection of calibration areas, potentially resulting in underestimation of mowing frequency and grazing intensity."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers validated their predictions of key parameters of grassland LUI using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on Sentinel-2 satellite data by comparing them with comprehensive in situ grassland management data. This means that they compared the predictions made by the CNN model with actual data collected on the ground, such as information on grazing intensity, mowing frequency, and fertilizer application. By comparing the predicted values with the actual values, they were able to assess the accuracy and reliability of their methodology."
