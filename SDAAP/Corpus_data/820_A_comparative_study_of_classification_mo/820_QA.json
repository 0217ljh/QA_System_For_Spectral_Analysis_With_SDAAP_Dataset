        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study for evaluating the classification of Astragalus from 10 different origins is accuracy rate. The accuracy rate measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. \n\nThe accuracy rates achieved in the related study using different machine learning algorithms are as follows:\n- Support Vector Machine (SVM): 45%\n- Extreme Learning Machine (ELM): 30%\n- Random Forest-Support Vector Machine (RF-SVM): 83.33%\n- Random Forest-Extreme Learning Machine (RF-ELM): 58.33%\n- Gray Wolf Optimizer-Random Forest-Support Vector Machine (GWO-RF-SVM): 85%\n- Gray Wolf Optimizer-Random Forest-Extreme Learning Machine (GWO-RF-ELM): 92%\n\nBased on these accuracy rates, it can be observed that the metric of accuracy rate can provide insights into the performance of different classification models in distinguishing Astragalus samples from different origins.

They used GWO to improve the classification accuracy of the models. By applying GWO to RF-SVM and RF-ELM, two new classification models were constructed: gray wolf optimizer-random forest-support vector machine (GWO-RF-SVM) and gray wolf optimizer-random forest-extreme learning machine (GWO-RF-ELM). The accuracy rates of these optimized models were reported as 85% and 92%, respectively."
