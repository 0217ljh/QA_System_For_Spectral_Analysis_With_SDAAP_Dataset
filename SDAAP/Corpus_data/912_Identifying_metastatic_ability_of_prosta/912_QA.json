Based on the information provided in the related study, native fluorescence spectroscopy (NFL) along with machine learning (ML) algorithms can be considered superior to traditional methods in developing a noninvasive label-free optical biopsy technique for detecting different metastatic potentials of prostate cancer cells. \n\nThe study used NFL spectroscopy to retrieve characteristic molecular information from prostate cancer cells. ML algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) were employed for dimension reduction and feature detection. These techniques allowed for the identification of key biomolecules correlated with metastatic potentials, such as tryptophan, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and hypothetically lactate.\n\nBy analyzing the relative concentrations of these key molecular components, the cancer cells with different metastatic potentials were successfully classified with high accuracy using support vector machines (SVMs). This suggests that the changes in the relative concentrations of these key fluorophores retrieved from NFL spectra can serve as potential criteria for detecting prostate cancer cells of different metastatic abilities.\n\nOverall, the combination of NFL spectroscopy and ML algorithms offers a noninvasive and label-free approach that can effectively detect different metastatic potentials of prostate cancer cells."
