The study found that the Random Forest (RF) model with optimal variables had better performance in forest canopy height estimation compared to the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) values for CF, BF, and MF were 0.72, 0.59, and 0.62, respectively. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values for CF, BF, and MF were 3.15, 3.37, and 3.26 meters, respectively."

        "Output": "Yes, the synergy of ICESat-2 with other remote sensing data, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, multi-spectral images, and topographic data, can be considered as a superior method for estimating forest canopy height compared to traditional methods. The study proposed a new method that utilized the complementary information from multiple sources of remote sensing data to estimate forest canopy height. By combining the spaceborne LiDAR (ICESat-2) data with SAR data, multi-spectral images, and topographic data, the method was able to provide spatio-continuous forest canopy height mapping. The accuracy of the estimation models considering forest types was found to be better than the models grouping all types of forest together. The results also showed that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm with optimal variables had better performance in forest canopy height estimation compared to Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT). Therefore, the synergy of ICESat-2 with other remote sensing data can indeed be considered as a superior method for estimating forest canopy height compared to traditional methods."
