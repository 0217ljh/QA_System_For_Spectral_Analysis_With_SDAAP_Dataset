        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the THz-ELM model is classification accuracy. With the selected optimal parameter pairs, the classification accuracy of the THz-ELM model for the transgenic and non-transgenic soybean oil samples in the training set and predicting set can exceed 89% simultaneously. Therefore, the classification accuracy can go up to at least 89%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers optimized the parameter combination of penalty coefficient C and the number of hidden nodes L in the ELM model using leave-one-out cross validation. This method allowed them to achieve the optimum balance among recognition accuracy, generalization ability, and training complexity. By testing different combinations of C and L and evaluating the classification accuracy, they were able to select the optimal parameter pairs (C = 0.12, L = 70) for the THz-ELM model."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, terahertz spectroscopy combined with extreme learning machine (ELM) can be considered a superior and nondestructive method for the identification of transgenic soybean oils without any sample pretreatment, as compared to traditional procedures such as PCR and ELISA. Past study demonstrates that the THz-ELM model achieved a classification accuracy of over 89% for transgenic and non-transgenic soybean oil samples. This indicates that THz spectroscopy has the potential to replace antecedent procedures like PCR and ELISA, providing a new comprehensive tool for distinguishing between non-transgenic and transgenic soybean oils."
