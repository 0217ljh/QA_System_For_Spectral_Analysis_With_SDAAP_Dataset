These models were used to predict the DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging capacities, and ferric-ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values of the rose petals. The results showed that the BP-ANN model had higher prediction accuracy compared to the PLSR model for determining the antioxidant capacities. By using NIR spectral data and multivariate calibration, these mathematical models could reliably predict the antioxidant capacities of IR-dried rose petals, thus improving drying efficiency and retaining product quality."

        "Output": "The use of NIR spectroscopic parameters and mathematical models in predicting the antioxidant capacities of IR-dried rose petals offers several advantages compared to traditional methods in terms of drying efficiency and product quality improvement during infrared drying (IRD).\n\nFirstly, the use of NIR spectroscopic parameters allows for non-destructive and real-time monitoring of the drying process. This means that the drying progress can be continuously monitored without the need for manual sampling and analysis, leading to improved drying efficiency.\n\nSecondly, by establishing relationships between the NIR spectrum and the antioxidant capacities, mathematical models such as partial least squares regression (PLSR) and back propagation-artificial neural network (BP-ANN) can accurately predict the antioxidant capacities of the dried rose petals. This enables the optimization of the drying process to achieve the desired antioxidant capacities, resulting in improved product quality.\n\nFurthermore, the results of model fitting showed that the BP-ANN model displayed higher prediction accuracy compared to the PLSR model. This indicates that the use of mathematical models based on NIR spectral data can provide more reliable predictions of the antioxidant capacities during IRD.\n\nOverall, the use of NIR spectroscopic parameters and mathematical models in predicting the antioxidant capacities of IR-dried rose petals offers a more efficient and effective approach compared to traditional methods. It allows for real-time"
