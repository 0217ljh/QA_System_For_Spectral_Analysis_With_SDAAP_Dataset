        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction model is the coefficient of determination R-2. This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (gasoline octane number) that can be explained by the independent variables (weights and thresholds optimized by the self-adaptive genetic algorithm). \n\nThe coefficient of determination R-2 can range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit of the model to the data. In the experiment mentioned, the R-2 value improved from 0.81502 to 0.95628 after implementing the proposed model. This indicates a significant improvement in the accuracy and generalization of the prediction model.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric, R-2, can provide a good measure of the model's accuracy and generalization, with a higher value indicating a better fit and performance."

        "Output": "The proposed self-adaptive genetic algorithm approach outperforms the traditional backpropagation neural network method in terms of training accuracy and generalization for gasoline octane number prediction. The traditional BP neural network model suffers from low training accuracy and poor generalization due to randomly generated weights and thresholds at input. However, the novel approach optimizes the weights and thresholds using a self-adaptive genetic algorithm, resulting in improved accuracy and generalization. The coefficient of determination R-2 of the performance index in the experiment is improved from 0.81502 to 0.95628, and the average prediction error among 10 groups of experiments was reduced from 0.0061 to 0.0041."
