        "Output": "Yes, the deep learning CNN model can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods for prospecting porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) in the Duolong ore district in Tibet, China, using remote sensing imagery and geochemical element data. The related study applied a deep learning CNN model for mineral prospectivity mapping and achieved a classification accuracy of 0.956, which outperformed conventional machine learning models such as support vector machine and random forest. The CNN model effectively utilized geoscience big data, including remote sensing datasets and geochemical elements, to identify hydrothermal alteration minerals related to PCDs. The results were verified through field reconnaissance, indicating the feasibility of using deep learning-based methods for PCD prospecting in the Duolong ore district."
