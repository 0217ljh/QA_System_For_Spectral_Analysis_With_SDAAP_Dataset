The qMRI biomarkers were constructed through a multi-step feature extraction/reduction/selection framework using the conventional MR imaging data acquired from 100 patients (133 lesions). These qMRI biomarkers captured the heterogeneity in the surrounding regions of the tumor, including edema and tumor/lesion margins.\n\nThe machine learning techniques were used to analyze and interpret the qMRI biomarkers in order to predict the likelihood of LF."
