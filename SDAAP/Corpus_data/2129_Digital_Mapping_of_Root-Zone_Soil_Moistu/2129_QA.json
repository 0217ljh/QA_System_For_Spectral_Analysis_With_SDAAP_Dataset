        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the root-zone soil moisture models in the study was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and observed values. The R-2 values obtained in this study ranged from 0.65 to 0.82, indicating a moderate to strong correlation between the predicted and observed root-zone soil moisture values. However, it is important to note that the R-2 metric alone does not provide information about the absolute accuracy of the models or the potential for errors. Other metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were also used in the study to assess the performance of the models."

        "Output": "The machine learning algorithms were used to estimate root-zone soil moisture in the kiwifruit orchard in Shaanxi, China using UAV multispectral images by analyzing several spectral variables selected based on variable importance rankings. The algorithms used were random forest models, and they were applied to simulate kiwi root-zone soil moisture during the critical fruit growth period. The results showed that the random forest models had better performance compared to the other two machine learning algorithms. This approach of using machine learning algorithms with UAV multispectral images can provide accurate estimation of root-zone soil moisture and can be a valuable tool for growers in site-specific field management."
