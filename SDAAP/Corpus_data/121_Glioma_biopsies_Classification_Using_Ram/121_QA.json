        "input": "",
        "Output": "Raman spectroscopy (RS) has shown potential as a method for discriminating between normal-appearing and neoplastic tissue in patients undergoing glioma resection. Past study analyzing 63 fresh tissue biopsies, RS with machine learning algorithms achieved an accuracy and precision of 83% and 82%, respectively, in distinguishing between normal-appearing and neoplastic tissue. Additionally, 19 novel Raman shifts with known biological relevance were identified, further supporting the development of RS as an intraoperative tool for glioma detection. Therefore, RS can be considered as a promising method for discriminating between normal-appearing and neoplastic tissue in glioma resection, potentially offering advantages over traditional methods."
