        "Output": "Yes, the supervised feature selection with SPA+GA can be used in this research to predict quality-indicating attributes of food materials using hyperspectral images with pH and Brix values of greengages. The analysis of accuracy and computational expense showed that supervised feature selection with SPA+GA was superior to unsupervised SPA for better modeling accuracy. Therefore, using SPA+GA for feature selection would likely result in more accurate models for predicting the quality-indicating attributes of food materials."
