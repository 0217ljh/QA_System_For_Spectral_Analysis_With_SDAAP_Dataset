        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models' performance in the related study was the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values, providing an indication of the model's accuracy. \n\nThe RMSE can go as far as providing a quantitative measure of the average error in the AGB estimation. It allows for comparison between different models and helps identify the model that performs the best in terms of minimizing the difference between predicted and actual AGB values."

        "Output": "Yes, the random forest (RF) model can be applied to other research using multi-spectral unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery. The RF model demonstrated high accuracy in estimating shrub willow above-ground biomass (AGB) in this study, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.73 Mg/ha and an R-2 value of 0.95. These results indicate that the RF model is effective in predicting AGB using UAS imagery. Therefore, it can be utilized in other research projects that involve estimating biomass or other related variables using similar data sources and conditions."
