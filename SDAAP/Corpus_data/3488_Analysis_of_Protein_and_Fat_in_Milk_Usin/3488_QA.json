        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the milk quality in the related study was the coefficient of determination (R-2) value. The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the milk composition that can be explained by the NIR absorption multispectra and the machine learning algorithm. \n\nThe R-2 values obtained for milk protein and fat contents were 0.949 and 0.996, respectively. This indicates that the prediction models developed using the multichannel infrared spectral sensor and GBRT algorithm were able to accurately determine the milk protein and fat contents, with a high level of accuracy."

        "Output": "The proposed method for milk quality evaluation using a multichannel infrared spectral sensor and broadband infrared light source is described as fast, easy, and environmentally friendly compared to traditional chemical measurement methods. Traditional methods are stated to be time-consuming and laborious, while also being highly polluting. In contrast, the new method is said to facilitate fast and real-time determination of milk composition. It is also mentioned that the method is simple, affordable, and environmentally friendly. Therefore, the proposed method is presented as a more efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional methods in terms of speed, ease, and environmental impact."
