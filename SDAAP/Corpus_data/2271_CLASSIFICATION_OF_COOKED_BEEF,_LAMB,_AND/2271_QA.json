        "Output": "In the related study, three machine learning algorithms were used to classify the cooked meat samples. The algorithms used were fuzzy neural networks (FNN), random forests, and k-nearest neighbours. The researchers established three classification models using these algorithms. They used the spectral data, texture information, and the fusion of them as input features for the models. The models were trained on a calibration set of data and then tested on a prediction set of data. The performance of the models was evaluated based on their correct classification rate. The results showed that the RFA-FNN model performed the best, with a high correct classification rate of 96.2% for the calibration set and 94.93% for the prediction set."

        "Output": "The integration of NIR hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique and machine learning methods has shown to be more effective compared to traditional methods in the classification of cooked meat products. In the study mentioned, three classification models were established using different machine learning algorithms: fuzzy neural networks (FNN), random forests, and k-nearest neighbours. The results showed that the RFA-FNN model performed the best, with a high correct classification rate of 96.2% and 94.93% for the calibration sets and prediction sets, respectively.\n\nThis demonstrates that the combination of HSI techniques and machine learning methods provides a more accurate and reliable approach to classifying cooked meat products. Traditional methods may not have the same level of accuracy and may rely on subjective assessments or limited data. The integration of HSI and machine learning allows for the extraction of spectral data and texture information, which can be used to train models and make more precise classifications."
