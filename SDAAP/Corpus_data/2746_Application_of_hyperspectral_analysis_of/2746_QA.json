        "Output": "The use of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm contributes to the accurate determination of Chl-a concentration in water using hyperspectral remote sensing by establishing a Chl-a concentration estimation model. This model utilizes the spectral reflectance and Chl-a concentration data obtained from Nansi Lake to train the algorithm. The XGBoost algorithm is known for its ability to handle complex relationships and large datasets, making it suitable for analyzing the hyperspectral data. \n\nBy inputting the spectral features extracted from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis into the XGBoost algorithm, the model can learn the patterns and correlations between the spectral features and Chl-a concentration. This allows the algorithm to make accurate predictions of Chl-a concentration based on the spectral data.\n\nThe study found that the XGBoost algorithm achieved the highest estimation accuracy among the models tested, with an R-2 value of 0.9024 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.1312 \u6e2dg/L for the inverse model. This indicates that the XGBoost algorithm was able to effectively capture the relationship between the spectral features and Chl-a concentration, resulting in more accurate predictions."

The results of the study show that this combination of parameters fits the measured Chl-a concentrations better than the original spectral data, with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.8588.
