        "Output": "The results of using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and K-Nearest neighbours (KNN) as machine learning algorithms in improving the NIR model for classifying the maturity stage of durian fruit are as follows:\n\n- The LDA model developed using a combination of rind and stem spectra provided the greatest efficiency, exhibiting 97.28% and 100% accuracy for LWNIR and SWNIR spectrometers, respectively.\n- The use of durian rind spectra only obtained between 83.15% and 88.04% accuracy for the LWNIR spectrometer.\n- The SWNIR spectrometer provided accuracy ranging from 64.73% to 93.77%.\n- The performance of the model increased when developing with a combination of rind and stem spectra.\n\nOverall, the LDA model showed the highest accuracy in classifying the maturity stage of durian fruit when combined with both rind and stem spectra."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of durian rind and stem spectra can be used to improve the NIR model for classifying the maturity stage of durian fruit in a completely non-destructive measurement. The past study found that the use of durian rind spectra alone provided accuracy ranging from 83.15% to 88.04% for the LWNIR spectrometer and 64.73% to 93.77% for the SWNIR spectrometer. However, when the rind and stem spectra were combined, the accuracy of the model significantly increased. The LDA model developed using a combination of rind and stem spectra achieved 97.28% and 100% accuracy for LWNIR and SWNIR spectrometers, respectively. Therefore, the combination of durian rind and stem spectra can effectively improve the NIR model for classifying the maturity stage of durian fruit in a non-destructive manner."
