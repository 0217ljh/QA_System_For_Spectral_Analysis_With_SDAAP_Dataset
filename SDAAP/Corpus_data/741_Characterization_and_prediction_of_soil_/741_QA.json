        "Output": "The random forest (RF) modeling method is compared to traditional methods, such as support vector machine (SVM) and partial least-squares regression (PLSR), in predicting soil organic matter (SOM) using spectroscopy in reclaimed mine soil with different reclamation ages. The related study found that RF is a more appropriate method for assessing the performance of a selected spectral region and provides more accurate results. The root mean square error (RMSE) between predicted and observed SOM values using RF was 4.34 g center dot kg(-1). This suggests that RF outperforms SVM and PLSR in predicting SOM levels in reclaimed mine soil."
