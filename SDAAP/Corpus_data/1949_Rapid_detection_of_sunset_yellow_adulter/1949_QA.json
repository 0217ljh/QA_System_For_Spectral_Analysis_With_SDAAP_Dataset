        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the classification models in this study is accuracy. The accuracy metric measures the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. \n\nAccording to the information provided, the SVM classifier using 50 variables achieved an accuracy of 0.90, which means that it correctly classified 90% of the samples. This indicates a high level of accuracy in the classification of the sunset yellow (SY) adulteration in tea powders."

        "Output": "The combination of FT-IR with RCGA-LS-SVM is highly effective in rapidly detecting SY in tea powder compared to traditional methods. The study found that using this technique, the SVM classifier with 50 variables achieved an accuracy of 0.90 in classifying SY adulteration. Additionally, when quantifying SY based on characteristic wavenumbers, the RCGA-LS-SVM model resulted in the lowest RMSECV (0.1956) with high regression coefficient values (R-C(2) = 0.9989 and R-P(2) = 0.9979) when 50 fingerprint variables were used. These results demonstrate that the FT-IR combined with RCGA-LS-SVM procedure is a robust and efficient technique for rapidly detecting SY in tea powder."
