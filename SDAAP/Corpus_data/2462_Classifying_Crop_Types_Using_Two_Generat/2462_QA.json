According to the related study, RF and SVM returned the highest overall producer's and user's accuracies compared to other algorithms such as Naive Bayes (NB) and WekaXMeans (WXM). Therefore, using RF and SVM algorithms would be a suitable approach for classifying major agricultural crops in the related study."
