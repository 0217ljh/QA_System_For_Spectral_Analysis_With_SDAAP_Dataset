        "Output": "Yes. According to the past study, time-resolved spectroscopy and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can accurately classify patient-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from different cancer samples and healthy controls for cancer screening and follow-up tools. The past study used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements on blood samples-derived EVs from cancer patients and healthy controls. The obtained FCS autocorrelation spectra were processed into power spectra using the fast Fourier transform algorithm. Machine learning algorithms, such as AdaBoost Random Forest (RF) classifier, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron, were applied to distinguish cancer spectra from healthy control spectra. The RF classifier exhibited the highest classification accuracy and performance metrics in distinguishing the FCS power spectra of cancer patients from those of healthy controls. Additionally, image-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were assessed on the power spectral images and showed nearly equal classification performance with high sensitivity and specificity scores. Therefore, the combination of time-resolved spectroscopy and AI algorithms can accurately classify patient-derived EVs for cancer screening and follow-up tools."
