The R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. \n\nThe R-2 value achieved by the attention-based LSTM model is 0.93, which indicates a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values of shrimp freshness. This suggests that the model can accurately extract and utilize the physical and chemical composition information of the shrimp tissue to predict its freshness."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of the attention mechanism in the proposed shrimp freshness detection method using spatially offset Raman spectroscopy and attention-based LSTM is to weight the output of each LSTM module. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant and informative features extracted from the physical and chemical composition information of the shrimp tissue. By assigning different weights to different features, the attention mechanism helps the model prioritize and emphasize the important information for accurate prediction of the storage dates of the shrimps. This feature fusion and weighting process enhances the performance of the LSTM model and improves the overall accuracy of the freshness detection method."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The advantages of using spatially offset Raman spectroscopy combined with an attention-based LSTM model in the proposed shrimp freshness detection method are as follows:\n\n1. Subsurface Information Extraction: Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) allows for the identification and extraction of subsurface shrimp meat information. This overcomes the challenge of shell occlusion and signal interference, which are common in optical detection of intact in-shell shrimps.\n\n2. Reduction of Physical Information Loss: The proposed method addresses the issue of physical information loss associated with SORS technology. By using the attention-based LSTM model, the physical and chemical composition information of the shrimp tissue can be effectively extracted and utilized for freshness detection.\n\n3. Optimum Offset Distance Determination: The conventional machine learning algorithm with manual selection of the optimal spatially offset distance can be time-consuming and prone to errors. However, the attention-based LSTM model automatically determines the optimum offset distance, eliminating the need for manual selection and reducing human operational errors.\n\n4. Improved Prediction Performance: The attention-based LSTM model achieves superior prediction performance compared to conventional machine learning algorithms. The R-2 (coefficient of determination), RMSE (root mean square error), and RPD (residual predictive deviation) values obtained by the attention-based LSTM model demonstrate"
