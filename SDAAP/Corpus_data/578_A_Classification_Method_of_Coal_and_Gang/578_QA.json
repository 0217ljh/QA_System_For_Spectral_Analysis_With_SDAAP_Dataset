        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the classification models in the experiment was the average accuracy of 10-fold cross-validation (ACC), classification accuracy (ACC), and AUC values. \n\nThe XGBoost algorithm performed the best in the experiment, with an average accuracy of 0.9572, classification accuracy of 0.9705, and AUC value of 0.9716. These values indicate strong stability and classification capabilities of the XGBoost algorithm in recognizing coal and gangue.\n\nAdditionally, a simplified model combining recursive feature elimination (RFE) and XGBoost (RFEXGB) was constructed, which further improved the performance. The simplified model achieved an average accuracy of 0.9657, classification accuracy of 0.9803, and AUC value of 0.9803. The data dimension was also reduced to 9, indicating improved stability and classification ability while reducing the complexity of the model."
