        "Output": "The Reed-Xiaoli (RX) algorithm was chosen as the metric for automatic detection of potential GSR samples in a scene containing cloth fabrics. This algorithm is considered a benchmark anomaly detection method for hyperspectral data and evaluates the likelihood that a pixel is an anomaly based on spectral distinctiveness from the background. The performance evaluation of this metric can be determined by setting a threshold parameter (T) and considering the distribution of the RX score under a Gaussian assumption with d-degrees of freedom."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of a hyperspectral camera and image processing algorithms can be used to detect potential gunshot residue (GSR) samples on cloth fabrics in forensic investigations. The related study states that the application of a hyperspectral camera, along with two well-known Machine Learning algorithms, can automatically indicate the potential presence of GSR samples in a scene containing cloth fabrics. The study involved creating and annotating a hyperspectral image dataset consisting of GSR samples on multiple fabric types. The results of the study show that accurate detection of GSR is possible using both unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised pixel classification approaches. Additionally, the related study mentions that hyperspectral imaging generally outperforms RGB imaging in terms of GSR detection accuracy. Therefore, the combination of a hyperspectral camera and image processing algorithms can be a valuable tool in supporting the evidence collection and analysis in forensic investigations involving GSR on cloth fabrics."
