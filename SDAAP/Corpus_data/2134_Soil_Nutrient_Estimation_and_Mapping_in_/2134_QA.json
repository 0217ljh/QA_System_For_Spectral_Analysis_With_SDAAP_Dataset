        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the study for estimating soil organic matter (SOM) and soil total nitrogen (STN) is the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The PSO algorithm was used to obtain optimized input weights and bias values for the extreme learning machine (ELM) model. \n\nIn terms of estimating SOM and STN, the PSO-ELM model based on the selected preference bands achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to other models such as support vector machine (SVM) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). The accuracy of the PSO-ELM model was measured using two metrics: R-2 (coefficient of determination) and RPD (ratio of performance to deviation). \n\nFor SOM estimation, the PSO-ELM model achieved an R-2 value of 0.73 and an RPD value of 1.91. For STN estimation, the PSO-ELM model achieved an R-2 value of 0.63 and an RPD value of 1.53. These metrics indicate that the PSO-ELM model can provide reasonably accurate predictions for both SOM and STN."

        "Output": "The performance of the MSC method is better than the SNV transformation and spectral derivatives in reducing image scattering noise in the preprocessing of hyperspectral images obtained from a UAV platform for estimating SOM and STN in farmland. The results showed that the MSC method yielded a result with higher correlation and lower signal-to-noise ratio, indicating its effectiveness in reducing image scattering noise."
