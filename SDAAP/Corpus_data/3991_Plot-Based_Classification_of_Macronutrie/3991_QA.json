        "input": "",
        "Output": "Rank filter was selected as the filter of choice and visible region had greater correlation than IR regions for K and Mg, with the inverse being true for N. For VIs, atmospherically or soil-corrected indices were selected for N (i.e., SAVI, SARVI, EVI, MSAVI, EVI2 and GARI), while those related to NIR (i.e., NDVI, TVI, IPVI) for K."

        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were used to classify macronutrient levels in oil palm crops using Landsat-8 imageries and Machine Learning (ML). The researchers applied variable rates of compost and inorganic fertilizer to experimental plots and studied the levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca). \n\nTo classify the macronutrient levels, the researchers acquired spectral features for each plot using image filters, separability metrics, vegetation indices (VI), and feature selection techniques. These spectral features were then used as input data for the machine learning models.\n\nThe models were calibrated and validated with 30 repetitions, and the best mean overall accuracy was reported for nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) levels at 79.7 +/- 4.3% and 76.6 +/- 4.1% respectively. However, the accuracies for phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) levels could not be accurately classified due to limitations in the dataset used.\n\nThe study highlighted the effectiveness of separability metrics in quantifying class separability and the importance of vegetation indices for nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) level classification."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, spectroscopic methods were not specifically mentioned as being used in this study. The study focused on using Landsat-8 imageries, image filters, separability metrics, vegetation indices, and feature selection to acquire spectral features for each plot. These spectral features were then used with machine learning models to classify macronutrient levels in oil palm crops. Therefore, it is unclear whether spectroscopic methods were used in this particular study."
