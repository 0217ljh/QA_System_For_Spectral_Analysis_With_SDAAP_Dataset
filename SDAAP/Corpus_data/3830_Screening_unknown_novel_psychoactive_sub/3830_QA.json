        "Output": "The spectral feature processing methods used for identifying unknown novel psychoactive substances (NPS) included mass-to-charge ratios rounded to the nearest integer for a total of 600 features, with no further feature engineering performed. Mass-charge ratios with no abundance peaks were assigned a value of zero."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models for NPS detection is the macro-F1 score. This metric measures the balance between precision and recall for each class and then takes the average across all classes. \n\nThe macro-F1 score can range from 0 to 1, with a higher score indicating better performance. In this case, the machine learning models achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.9, averaged across all cross-validation folds. This indicates that the models were able to effectively classify the 7 classes of NPS and unrelated compounds with a high level of accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of machine learning models, such as artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and balanced random forest (BRF), in identifying unknown NPS using GC-MS data can be considered superior to traditional detection methods. This is because these machine learning models have been developed specifically to address the analytical challenge of identifying unknown NPS, which often evade classical detection methods like spectral library matching. The study used 891 GC-MS spectra to train and evaluate these machine learning classifiers, and achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.9, indicating their effectiveness in classifying NPS. These results suggest that machine learning models can be a promising complement to traditional detection methods in the field of NPS detection."
