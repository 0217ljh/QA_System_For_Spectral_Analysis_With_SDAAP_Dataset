        "Output": "The spectroscopic liquid biopsy approach employed machine learning algorithms to detect brain tumors. The algorithms were effective in distinguishing between high-grade and low-grade gliomas, with sensitivities, specificities, and balanced accuracies above 88%, with the majority around 90% or greater."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectroscopic liquid biopsy approach can be used to detect smaller and low-grade gliomas, which are often difficult to detect using current liquid biopsy methods. The study mentioned in the text confirms the applicability of this approach to detect both small and low-grade gliomas. The results showed that the spectroscopic liquid biopsy approach had sensitivities, specificities, and balanced accuracies greater than 88%, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. Additionally, the approach was able to correctly identify cancer patients with tumour volumes as small as 0.2 cm\u9c81. This indicates that the spectroscopic liquid biopsy approach shows great promise for the early detection and diagnosis of smaller and low-grade gliomas."
