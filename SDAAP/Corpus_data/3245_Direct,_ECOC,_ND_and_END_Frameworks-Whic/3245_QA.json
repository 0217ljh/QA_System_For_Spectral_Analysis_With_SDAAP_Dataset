        "Output": "Yes, based on the related study, the proposed EOMPs (extended object-guided morphological profiles) are shown to outperform traditional image classification techniques for large-scale vegetation mapping using Sentinel-2A MSIL1C images in the arid land environment of the Ili River delta, Kazakhstan. The related study states that the superior performance of object-oriented (OO)-based techniques, including the proposed EOMPs, is clear for Sentinel-2A MSIL1C image classification."
