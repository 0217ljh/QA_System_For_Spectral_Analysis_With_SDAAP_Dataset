        "Output": "Yes, the minimalist, low-cost sensor using fluorescence spectroscopy can be considered as a superior alternative to traditional methods of chemical analysis and organoleptic evaluation for assessing the quality of olive oil. The sensor has the potential to perform olive oil quality assessment with an accuracy of 100% and can classify olive oil into different quality levels, such as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), virgin olive oil (VOO), and lampante olive oil (LOO). This technology offers a more accessible and cost-effective solution compared to the current methods that require advanced equipment and certified laboratories."
