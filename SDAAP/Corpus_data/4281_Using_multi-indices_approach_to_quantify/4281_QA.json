        "Output": "The SMRI (submerged mangrove recognition index) was found to be an effective indicator for detecting submerged mangroves in the study of mangrove forests along the Saudi Arabian coast of the Western Arabian Gulf (WAG). The results showed the robustness of SMRI in identifying and analyzing submerged mangrove forests using both high and medium spatial resolution satellite images. Additionally, the SMRI results were consistent with the distribution of mangroves observed in high-resolution WorldView-2 images. Therefore, the SMRI proved to be a reliable tool for detecting submerged mangroves in the study area."
