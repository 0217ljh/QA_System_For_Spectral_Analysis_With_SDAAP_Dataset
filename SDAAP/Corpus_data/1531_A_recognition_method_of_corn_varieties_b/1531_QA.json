Instead of relying solely on chemical analysis, the model incorporates near-infrared (NIR) spectrum processing technology. This allows for a faster and more efficient analysis of corn varieties.\n\nSecondly, the model improves upon the low accuracy of traditional machine learning models in recognizing corn varieties. By combining the NIR spectrum processing technology with the deep learning model of convolutional neural network (LeNet-5), the recognition model achieves a high accuracy rate of 99.20%.\n\nAdditionally, the model utilizes preprocessing techniques to enhance the accuracy of the recognition. The spectral data is preprocessed using the de-trending algorithm (DT) and the competitive adaptive reweighting sampling algorithm (CARS). These algorithms extract 114 characteristic wavenumbers from the original NIR spectral data, which further improves the accuracy of the model.\n\nOverall, the proposed recognition model for corn varieties provides a more accurate and rapid method for identifying different corn varieties compared to traditional machine learning models and the chemical analysis process."
