        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the inversion accuracy of water quality parameters in the related study is the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of the inversion results.\n\nThe R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the water quality parameter that can be explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit between the predicted and observed values.\n\nThe RMSE represents the average difference between the predicted and observed values, providing a measure of the overall error in the inversion results. It is expressed in the same unit as the water quality parameter being measured.\n\nThe MAPE measures the average percentage difference between the predicted and observed values, indicating the relative error in the inversion results. It is expressed as a percentage, with a lower value indicating a higher accuracy.\n\nThese metrics together provide a comprehensive evaluation of the inversion accuracy of water quality parameters."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning model was used in the study to obtain the spatial distribution of NH3-N, COD, and TP in medium- and small-sized inland rivers by utilizing the processed Sentinel-2 multispectral images. After applying the super-resolution algorithm to improve the image spatial resolution and weaken the interference of mixed pixels, the water quality parameters (NH3-N, COD, and TP) were inverted with improved accuracy. The quantitative evaluation results of the inversion accuracy were obtained, including the R-2 value, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Finally, the machine learning model was employed to analyze and interpret the data, resulting in the spatial distribution of NH3-N, COD, and TP in the studied rivers. This demonstrates the potential of the super-resolution algorithm in enhancing the retrieval accuracy of water quality parameters in remote sensing quantitative monitoring."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The application of the super-resolution algorithm in the study enhances the retrieval accuracy of water quality parameters in remote sensing quantitative monitoring compared to traditional methods by weakening the influence of mixed pixels while maintaining spectral invariance. Before the application of the super-resolution algorithm, the inversion accuracy of water quality parameters for NH3-N, COD, and TP were relatively low, with R-2 values ranging from 0.26 to 0.69. However, after the application of the super-resolution algorithm, the inversion accuracy significantly improved, with R-2 values ranging from 0.53 to 0.67. \n\nAdditionally, the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values also decreased after applying the super-resolution algorithm. For example, for NH3-N, the RMSE decreased from 0.177 to 0.161, and the MAPE decreased from 29.33% to 25.88%. Similarly, for COD, the RMSE decreased from 0.756 to 0.546, and the MAPE decreased from 4.62% to 3.36%. For TP, the RMSE decreased from 0.032 to 0.034, and the MAPE decreased from 30."
