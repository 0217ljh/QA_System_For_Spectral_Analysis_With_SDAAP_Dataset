The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the trace elements in the plutonium samples.\n\nIn terms of detection limits, the partial least squares (PLS) method proved superior and yielded detection limits (LoDs) of 15 parts per million (ppm) for iron and 20 ppm for nickel in plutonium metal."
