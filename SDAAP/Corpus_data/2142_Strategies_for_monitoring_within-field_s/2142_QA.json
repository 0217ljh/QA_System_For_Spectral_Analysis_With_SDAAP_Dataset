        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the research, machine learning models, specifically partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector regression (SVR), were utilized to monitor within-field soybean yield using Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing data. The researchers collected soybean yield maps using a combine harvester with a yield monitor in 15 fields across three farms in Parana State, southern Brazil. They then correlated the Sentinel-2 images, which included visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared spectral bands, as well as eight vegetation indices, with the recorded soybean yield.\n\nThe researchers found that pooling the information across the cropping season yielded better results compared to using single images. The best performance was achieved using the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared spectral bands under both PLSR and SVR methods. They evaluated field-, farm-, and global-based models at the grain filling stage and compared them to leaf-based hyperspectral reflectance data collected at the Brazilian National Soybean Research Center.\n\nSVR outperformed PLSR, showing a strong correlation between observed and predicted yield. For within-field soybean yield mapping, the researchers developed field-based SVR models individually for each field, which resulted in the highest accuracies. These findings demonstrate the potential of using machine learning methods,"

Among the different spectral bands and vegetation indices, the Vis/NIR/SWIR spectral bands showed the best performance in predicting soybean yield.\n\nTo further validate their findings, the researchers compared the results obtained from the Sentinel-2 data with leaf-based hyperspectral reflectance data collected at the Brazilian National Soybean Research Center. They found that the field-, farm-, and global-based models developed using the Vis/NIR/SWIR bands showed similar trends to the leaf-based data.\n\nFinally, the researchers"
