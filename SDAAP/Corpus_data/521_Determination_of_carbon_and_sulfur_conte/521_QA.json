        "Output": "Yes, the K-ELM model coupled with LIBS can be considered a superior spectroscopic method for accurately measuring carbon and sulfur content in coal compared to traditional methods. The results of the related study showed that the K-ELM model had excellent performance in both calibration and prediction sets, with low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and high correlation coefficients (R-2). The optimized K-ELM model achieved an RMSE of 0.3762% and an R-2 of 0.9994 for carbon, and an RMSE of 0.7704% and an R-2 of 0.9832 for sulfur in the prediction set. These results demonstrate that the K-ELM model coupled with LIBS has the potential to accurately measure carbon and sulfur content in coal."
