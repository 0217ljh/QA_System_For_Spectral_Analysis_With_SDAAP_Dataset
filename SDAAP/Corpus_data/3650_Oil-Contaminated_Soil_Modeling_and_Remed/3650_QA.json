        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to identify oil-contaminated and clear locations was spectral signatures. This metric was used to distinguish between clean soil and oil-contaminated soil in different periods, such as extremely (1991), highly (1992), and moderately (2002) oil-contaminated soil. The spectral signatures were evaluated using Landsat-5 images in several periods in 1991."

        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the suggested approach of combining remote sensing technologies and machine learning can be used to model oil-contaminated soils in other regions besides Kuwait. The study specifically focuses on the onshore oil spill in Kuwait in 1991 and the use of spectral signatures and spectral indices for oil-contamination detection in that specific area."
