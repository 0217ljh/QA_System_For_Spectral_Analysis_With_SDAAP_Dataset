        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is possible that the cost-sensitive training approach used for discriminating waste and gold-bearing particles in ore sorting can be applied to other ore sorting processes to achieve similar cost savings and efficiency improvements. The study aimed to economically balance the ore acceptance rate with the waste rejection rate by minimizing the nominal profit lost due to sorting error. By using real cost values from the milling process and applying cost-sensitive training, the study was able to reduce the nominal profit lost per tonne of crushed rock particles. This approach could potentially be applied to other ore sorting processes to optimize the acceptance and rejection rates, thereby reducing costs and improving efficiency."
