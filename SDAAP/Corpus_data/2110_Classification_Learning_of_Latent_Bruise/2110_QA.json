The text primarily focuses on the use of machine learning classifiers, such as ensemble subspace discriminant (ESD), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), to build models for detecting bruises at their latent stage. It does not provide information on the comparison between hyperspectral imaging and traditional methods."
