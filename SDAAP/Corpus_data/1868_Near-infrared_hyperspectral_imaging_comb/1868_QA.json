        "Output": "Yes, the GA-PLSR model used in this research can be considered superior to traditional methods for predicting the physicochemical properties of durian pulp using the NIR-HSI system. The GA-PLSR model achieved a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.97 for dry matter (DM) prediction and 0.86 for fat content (FC) prediction, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted values and the actual values. Additionally, the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for DM and FC were 1.12% and 0.64% respectively, indicating a low level of error in the predictions. These results suggest that the GA-PLSR model is highly accurate and reliable in predicting the physicochemical properties of durian pulp."
