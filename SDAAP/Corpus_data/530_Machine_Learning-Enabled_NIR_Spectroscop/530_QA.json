        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning-based data analytics process was effective in deconvoluting the chemical properties from the physical effects in NIR spectra of powder blends and assessing blend uniformity in the related study. By leveraging sophisticated data analytics processes, the researchers were able to identify various sources of variability that might affect the blend uniformity results. They applied clustered regression (both non-parametric and linear) to overcome bias in the NIR results. The model's performance was assessed using hold-out and k-fold internal cross-validation, which demonstrated low mean absolute error and interval estimates for blend homogeneity. Additionally, bootstrapping-based cross-validation was used to evaluate model generalizability and transferability, showing promising results with low mean absolute error for blend uniformity. Overall, the integration of machine learning with NIR spectral analysis proved to be effective in achieving the objectives of the related study."
