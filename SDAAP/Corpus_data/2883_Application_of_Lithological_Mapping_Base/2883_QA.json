        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the M3D-DCNN method can be applied to other remote sensing datasets for similar purposes. The related study focuses on the assessment of GF-5 AHSI imagery for lithological mapping and compares it with other datasets. It states that the M3D-DCNN method is accurate and stable for this specific purpose. However, it does not provide information on whether the method can be directly applied to other remote sensing datasets. Further research or experimentation would be required to determine the applicability of the M3D-DCNN method to other datasets for similar purposes."
