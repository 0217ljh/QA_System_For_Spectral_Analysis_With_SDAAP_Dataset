        "Output": "The authenticity of Arabica coffee from different geographical origins in Indonesia was verified using spectroscopy combined with PCA and a machine learning algorithm (ANN). Spectra from pure green coffee were collected using Vis-NIR and SWNIR spectrometers. Preprocessing techniques were applied to obtain accurate information from the spectroscopic data. \n\nFirst, PCA was used to compress the spectroscopic information and generate new variables called PCs scores. These scores were then used as inputs for the ANN model. The ANN model used in this past study was a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based model.\n\nThe discrimination of Arabica coffee from different origins was conducted using the MLP-based ANN model. The accuracy of the model was evaluated through internal cross-validation, training, and testing sets. The accuracy achieved ranged from 90% to 100%, and the error in the classification process did not exceed 10%.\n\nOverall, the combination of spectroscopy, PCA, and the ANN model proved to be successful in verifying the origin of Arabica coffee. The MLP combined with PCA demonstrated superior generalization ability, making it suitable for this authentication process."
