        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the low-cost and low-resolution archived images can be used as an effective alternative to high-resolution images in automatically detecting the existence of asbestos-cement corrugated roofing tiles. The research mentioned in the related study achieved an accuracy of over 85% using these archived images. This demonstrates that the machine learning approach, combined with the use of ground-truth data and X-ray refraction detection, can successfully identify the presence of asbestos-cement corrugated roofing tiles even with lower quality images."
