They employed ML classifiers such as SVM, DT, KNN, LR, and LightGBM for separating pure oil and margarine samples, while regressors like KNN, XGBoost, RF, SVR, and DT were used to quantify adulterant concentration in both oil and margarine samples."

        "Output": "The researchers assessed the combined utility of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and machine learning techniques by using fingerprints of the oils and margarines derived from the spectra region 4000-600 cm-1. They then combined these fingerprints with machine learning models. The first two principal components were used to explain the variance of the pure oils and margarines, as well as the adulterated samples. The researchers also used ML regression models to quantify the degree of adulteration in each oil and margarine. Sunflower oil and canolaflaxseed oil margarine were used as adulterants."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The ATR-FTIR spectroscopy method, combined with machine learning techniques, shows promise in identifying and classifying different types of oils and margarines, as well as quantifying the degree of adulteration in each oil and margarine. The past study found that the fingerprints derived from the spectra region 4000-600 cm-1, combined with machine learning models, were able to accurately classify pure margarines and achieve high classification accuracies for pure oils. Additionally, the regression models using machine learning techniques were able to estimate the degree of adulteration in each oil and margarine. However, it is important to note that the performance of different machine learning models varied, with KNN being the most effective in classifying pure oil samples. Therefore, while ATR-FTIR spectroscopy combined with machine learning shows promise, further research and comparison with traditional methods are necessary to determine its superiority."
