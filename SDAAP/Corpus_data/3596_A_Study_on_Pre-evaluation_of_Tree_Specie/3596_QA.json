        "Output": "Yes, the CAS500-4 satellite's spectral information can be effectively used for satellite-based tree species classification using RapidEye imagery in the Chuncheon forest management complex. The related study aimed to pre-evaluate the possibility of satellite-based tree species classification using RapidEye, which has similar specifications to the CAS500-4. The spectral information extracted from the growing season image was used in the classification process, along with GLCM texture information derived from the growing and non-growing seasons NIR bands. The classification accuracy was found to be 69.29% when both spectral information and texture information were used."
