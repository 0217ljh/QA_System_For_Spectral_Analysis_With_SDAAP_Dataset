        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it is stated that the machine learning regressors (MLRs) provide predictions with an average 98% of the data variance being explained by the model. This suggests that the metric used to evaluate the performance could be the coefficient of determination (R-squared), which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables."

        "Output": "Yes, the machine learning-based approach used in this study can potentially be applied to other 2D materials to extract structural information from Raman spectra. The text states that this work serves as a proof of concept that machine-learning analysis is a potentially powerful tool for interpretation of Raman spectra of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and other 2D materials. Therefore, the approach developed in this study can be extended to analyze Raman spectra of other 2D materials and extract their structural information."
