        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictive models in the rapid analytical method was the combined error. This metric measures the overall accuracy of the predictions by considering both the concentration and classification errors. \n\nIn terms of error reduction, the rapid analytical method using machine learning techniques was able to significantly improve the predictive accuracy compared to the conventional linear approach. The best predictive model achieved a combined error of 2.4%, whereas the linear approach had a combined error of 14.6%. This represents a reduction of approximately 83.6% in error. \n\nFurthermore, the improvement obtained with machine learning techniques was consistent for all the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) studied, but it was most pronounced for Bevacizumab. The combined error for Bevacizumab was reduced by 88.34% (from 17.9% to 2.1%) using the machine learning approach."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of machine learning techniques improved the prediction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the rapid analytical method for quality control compared to a linear approach by reducing prediction errors. The traditional linear approach had a combined error of 14.6%, while the best predictive model using machine learning had a combined error of only 2.4%. This means that the machine learning model was able to more accurately predict the quality of the mAbs samples. Additionally, the concentration and classification errors were significantly lower with machine learning, with only three spectra misclassified out of 429 in the test set. This improvement was consistent for all molecules, but the largest reduction in combined errors (88.34%) was observed for Bevacizumab. Overall, the use of machine learning techniques allowed for more accurate and reliable quality control in the analysis of mAbs."
