        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction models in the related study was the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, it was used to assess the relationship between the predicted soluble sugar content of jujube fruits and the actual soluble sugar content.\n\nThe related study found that the sucrose prediction model, which was trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), had the best performance. The correlation coefficient of the verification set for this model was reported to be 0.88. This indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the predicted and actual soluble sugar content of jujube fruits. Therefore, the chosen metric of correlation coefficient can go up to 0.88 in terms of evaluating the performance of the prediction models in the related study."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of multispectral imaging combined with deep learning can be considered a superior method for predicting the soluble sugar content in jujube fruits compared to traditional methods. The related study analyzed the feasibility of this approach and found that the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model, established using multispectral imaging, had the best performance in predicting the soluble sugar content of jujube fruits. The correlation coefficient of the verification set was 0.88, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual soluble sugar content. This suggests that using CNNs and multispectral imaging can provide a rapid and nondestructive method for determining the quality of jujube fruits, specifically their soluble sugar content, without the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive manual chemical measurement."
