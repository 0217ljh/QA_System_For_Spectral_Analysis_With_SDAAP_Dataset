        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the DeepRWC model was compared to standard approaches such as partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine regression (SVR) in predicting the relative water content (RWC) of plants using spectral reflectance signature. The quantitative analysis showed that the DeepRWC model outperformed both PLSR and SVR approaches. It achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and better R-2 value on all test datasets included in the study. Additionally, the DeepRWC model eliminated the need for any preprocessing or dimensionality reduction, which is required in the case of other standard techniques like PLSR and SVR. These results confirm the ability of the DeepRWC model to better predict the RWC of plants using spectral reflectance signature."
