        "Output": "The proposed approach for improving the accuracy of building footprint detection in satellite imagery using the U-Net architecture is to develop a suitable version of the U-Net specifically designed for this task. The goal is to create a model that can compete with the accuracy levels of past SpaceNet competition winners using only one model and one type of data. The researchers believe that this achievement could potentially surpass the current state-of-the-art. Additionally, the researchers plan to integrate techniques that have previously shown to improve the detection accuracy of U-Net-based footprint detectors, such as using an ensemble of different U-Net architectures, incorporating distance transform to enhance boundary detection accuracy, and integrating ancillary geospatial data on buildings. These enhancements will be incorporated in future work to further improve the accuracy of building footprint detection."
