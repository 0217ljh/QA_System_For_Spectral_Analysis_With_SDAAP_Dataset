        "input": "",
        "Output": "The lean-meat spectra were extracted by creating an image from the 660\u2013680 nm band corresponding to the red wavelength region from the hyperspectral data cube and calculating the mean value. This red region representing the color of lean meat was used as the basis image for further analysis."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the provided related study, the use of hyperspectral data in machine learning models can be considered a superior method for predicting the rancidity level of beef compared to traditional methods. The text mentions that machine learning models were developed using a near infrared hyperspectral image acquisition system to predict the degree of rancidity of beef. This non-destructive method allows for the collection of hyperspectral data cubes, which can be used to selectively extract lean-meat spectra from beef that was refrigerated for different lengths of time. Additionally, the related study states that a traditional method using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was performed to secure reference values for the rancidity level of the sample. \n\nBy applying machine learning techniques such as PLSR, ANN, and 1D-CNN to the hyperspectral data, models were developed to predict the rancidity level of beef. The related study also mentions that chemical maps were created for each developed model to visualize the performance of the model. \n\nTherefore, the use of hyperspectral data in machine learning models provides a non-destructive and potentially more accurate method for predicting the rancidity level of beef compared to traditional methods such as the TBARS experiment."
