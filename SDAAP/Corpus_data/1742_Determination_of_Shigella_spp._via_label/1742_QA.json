        "Output": "The One-Dimensional Multi-Scale CNN (1DMSCNN) model outperformed traditional methods in accurately distinguishing between the four Shigella spp. in the context of the study's purpose. The study compared four supervised learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and 1DMSCNN. Among these models, 1DMSCNN achieved the best performance in terms of predictive capacity. It was able to quickly and accurately distinguish between the different Shigella spp. based on the unique barcodes generated through surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) spectral deconvolution. Therefore, the 1DMSCNN model was found to be the most effective in accurately discriminating between the four Shigella spp. in this study."
