        "Output": "The results of combining the maps from each CNN stream using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) model in earthquake-induced landslide (EQIL) mapping showed an improvement in mapping accuracy. The study found that using the training dataset of spectral information along with the topographic factor of the slope helped distinguish landslide bodies from other similar features, such as barren lands. This led to an increase in the mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) accuracy, ranging from approximately zero to more than 17%. The D-S model was considered an optimizer method to combine the results from different scenarios, further enhancing the accuracy of the EQIL mapping."

        "Output": "The use of spectral information and topographic factors improved the mapping accuracy in earthquake-induced landslide (EQIL) mapping using a deep-learning convolution neural network (CNN) by helping to distinguish the landslide bodies from other similar features, such as barren lands. By incorporating the training dataset of the spectral information along with the topographic factor of the slope, the CNN model was able to accurately identify and classify the EQILs. This resulted in an improvement in the mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) metric, ranging from approximately zero to more than 17%. The combination of spectral information and topographic factors increased the accuracy of the mapping process, enabling a more precise identification and delineation of EQILs."
