        "Output": "The metric chosen to quantify the chemical compositions of sediment samples using FO-LIBS is internal standardization (IS). This method is considered reliable as it helps to reduce spectral fluctuations caused by spot size and matrix effects, allowing for more accurate quantification of multiple elements. The study mentioned that by adopting the most suitable combinations of emission lines, the fluctuation of emission lines caused by the spot size was limited with a relative standard deviation lower than 30%. Additionally, the calibration curves for all elements had an R-2 value higher than 0.9, indicating a strong correlation between the measured and actual concentrations. Therefore, the IS method is considered reliable for quantifying the chemical compositions of sediment samples using FO-LIBS."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the past study, two machine learning models, namely partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector regression (SVR), were utilized to address the challenges posed by matrix effects and spot size fluctuations in the analysis of sediment samples using fiber-optic LIBS.\n\nThese models were used to establish quantitative models for the sediments by correlating the spectral data obtained from the LIBS analysis with the known concentrations of the target elements in the samples. By training the models with a set of calibration samples, they were able to learn the relationship between the spectral features and the concentrations of the elements of interest.\n\nThe machine learning models were able to account for the spectral fluctuations caused by the spot size and matrix effects by identifying the most suitable combinations of emission lines for each element. This helped to limit the fluctuation of emission lines and reduce the impact of spot size variations on the accuracy of the analysis.\n\nThe past study found that all three methods, including the machine learning models, provided similar prediction results. However, it was noted that the internal standardization (IS) approach combined with machine learning models, such as PLSR and SVR, could establish more robust calibration models that were less sensitive to spot size variations. This suggests that the combination of IS and machine learning can effectively address the challenges"
