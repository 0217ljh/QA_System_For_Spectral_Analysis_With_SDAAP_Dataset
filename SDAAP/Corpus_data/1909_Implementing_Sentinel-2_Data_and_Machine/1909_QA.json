        "Output": "The impact of different stress incidence thresholds on the performance of the machine learning algorithms in detecting plant stress in olive trees using remote sensing data was tested in this experiment. A total of 26 thresholds were tested to determine how setting different thresholds for stress incidence affects model performance. The results showed that the best-performing model had a stress incidence threshold of 6%. However, the results also suggested that setting customized thresholds relevant to specific cases would provide optimal results."
