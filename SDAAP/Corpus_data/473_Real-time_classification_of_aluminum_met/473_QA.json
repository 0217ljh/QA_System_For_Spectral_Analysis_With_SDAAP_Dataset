        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the ML and DL models for aluminum sorting is the F1-score. The F1-score is a measure of a model's accuracy that takes into account both precision and recall. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance.\n\nThe F1-score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible score. In this study, the ML model achieved an F1-score of 0.80, while the DL model achieved an F1-score of 0.79. These scores indicate that both models performed well in classifying the aluminum scrap into the desired output classes."
