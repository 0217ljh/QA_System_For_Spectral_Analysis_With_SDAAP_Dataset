        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification results in the related study was the F1-score. The F1-score is a measure of a test's accuracy, taking into account both the precision and recall of the classification. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. \n\nThe F1-score can range from 0 to 1, with a higher score indicating better classification performance. In this study, the F1-score ranged from 67.2% to 91.5% depending on the tree species being classified."

        "Output": "The main objectives of using machine learning algorithms in the related study were to classify the dominant tree species (birch, beech, larch, and spruce) in the UNESCO Krkonose/Karkonosze Transboundary Biosphere Reserve. The study aimed to assess the forest stands classification in the reserve, which has undergone dynamic changes due to an ecological disaster that caused damage and death to a significant portion of the forests. The use of machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), allowed for the automation of the classification process and the identification of different tree species based on multispectral satellite images. The objective was to obtain accurate and reliable maps of the forest composition, considering the heterogeneity generated by the coexistence of dry big trunks and branches with naturally occurring young forests. Additionally, the study aimed to compare the results obtained from the machine learning algorithms with classifications made using hyperspectral APEX imagery, to assess the convergence in the recognition of woody species."
