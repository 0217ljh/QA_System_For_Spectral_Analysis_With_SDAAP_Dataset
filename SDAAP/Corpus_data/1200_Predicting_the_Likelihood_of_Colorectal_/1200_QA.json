The FNN model was able to predict the histologically diagnosed malignant tissues with a confidence range of 59.9-99.9%, with an average confidence score of 93.5%. This metric indicates the level of certainty or accuracy of the FNN model in predicting malignant tissues."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The SVM and FNN models were designed using the FT-IR spectral data of colorectal tissues that were identified as either benign or malignant by pathologists. Initially, the pathologists examined a set of samples and provided unanimous readings for their classification. However, for the samples with discordant readings, the SVM and FNN models were used to analyze the spectral data.\n\nThe FNN model, in particular, was trained using the spectral data of the concordant samples. It was able to predict the histologically diagnosed malignant tissues with a confidence range of 59.9-99.9% and an average confidence of 93.5%. Out of the 118 malignant samples, 84 (71.18%) were classified with an above-average confidence score, 34 (28.81%) classified below the average confidence score, and none were misclassified.\n\nSimilarly, the FNN model was also able to correctly identify the histologically confirmed benign samples with a confidence range of 51.5-99.7% and an average confidence of 91.64%. Out of the 83 benign samples, 60 (72.29%) were classified with an above-average confidence score, 22 (26.51%) classified below the average confidence score, and only "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The FNN model's ability to predict histologically diagnosed malignant tissues using FT-IR spectral data is superior to traditional methods relying on morphological changes in tissues. The study mentioned in the text demonstrates that the FNN model was able to predict malignant tissues with a confidence range of 59.9-99.9% and an average confidence score of 93.5%. Additionally, none of the malignant samples were misclassified by the FNN model. In contrast, traditional methods relying on visual examination often lack sensitivity and specificity, leading to lower accuracy in diagnosing colorectal cancer. Therefore, the FNN model, utilizing FT-IR spectral data, provides a more accurate and reliable method for predicting the likelihood of colorectal cancer without depending on morphological changes in tissues."
