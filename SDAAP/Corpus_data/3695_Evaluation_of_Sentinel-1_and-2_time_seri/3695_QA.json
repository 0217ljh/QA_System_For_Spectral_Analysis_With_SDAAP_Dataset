        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study demonstrated the potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S-2) images in estimating crop biophysical parameters of wheat and rapeseed in Brittany, France by comparing the respective values of S-1 and S-2 features. The researchers generated a dataset of 29 features, including spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from S-2 images, and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators derived from S-1 images. They then used Gaussian processes regression to estimate crop leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and water content (WC) based on these features. The results showed that the best models for estimating wheat WC, LAI, and biomass were achieved using the green band, NIR bands, and vegetation indices from S-2 images, respectively. For rapeseed biomass, the shortwave-infrared bands from S-2 images were most relevant. In terms of S-1-based models, the sigma(VH)-V-0 : sigma(VV)-V-0 ratio was the most relevant feature for estimating wheat LAI and rapeseed biomass, while the Shannon entropy polarization contribution performed best for wheat WC."
