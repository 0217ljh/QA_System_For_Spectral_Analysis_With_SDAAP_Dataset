        "Output": "The proposed method for analyzing coal characteristics using machine learning models contributes to reducing the cost and time required for coal analysis compared to traditional methods in the following ways:\n\n1. Efficiency: The method utilizes a deep belief network (DBN) to extract advanced features from the spectral data of coal samples. This allows for a quicker analysis process compared to traditional proximate and ultimate analysis methods, which can take up to 300 hours. The proposed method only takes about 5 hours to analyze 158 coal samples.\n\n2. Cost-effectiveness: The traditional proximate and ultimate analysis methods can be expensive, costing around $6,000 USD. In contrast, the proposed method only requires approximately $100 USD for the analysis of the same number of coal samples. This significant reduction in cost makes the proposed method more affordable and accessible.\n\n3. Accuracy: The results of the proposed method show that it can effectively predict the compositions of coal. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the method can provide accurate and reliable analysis results, ensuring the quality of coal is assessed correctly.\n\nOverall, the proposed method for analyzing coal characteristics using machine learning models offers a more efficient, cost-effective, and accurate alternative to traditional methods, significantly reducing the time and cost required for coal analysis."
