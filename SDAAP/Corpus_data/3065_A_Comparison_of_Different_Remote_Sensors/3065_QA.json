The R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and actual LAI values. \n\nIn this study, the R-2 values for the hyperspectral model and the multispectral model were reported as 0.702 and 0.816, respectively. These values indicate the level of correlation between the predicted LAI values and the ground truth LAI values."
