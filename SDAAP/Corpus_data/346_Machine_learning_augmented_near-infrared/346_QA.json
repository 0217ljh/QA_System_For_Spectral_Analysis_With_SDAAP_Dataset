The researchers trained convolutional neural networks using ex vivo spectra and cartilage reference properties. These trained networks were then used to predict the reference properties at baseline and follow-up time points.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with machine learning shows promise as a method for in vivo arthroscopic monitoring of cartilage defects. The past study used NIRS to measure near-infrared spectra in vivo at and around cartilage grooves induced in Shetland ponies. The spectra were then compared to ex vivo measurements and reference analyses to determine the relationship between the spectra and cartilage properties. The trained networks yielded significant correlations for cartilage thickness and instantaneous modulus, indicating that NIRS combined with machine learning can accurately predict these properties. \n\nCompared to traditional methods, NIRS combined with machine learning offers several advantages. It allows for non-invasive and real-time monitoring of cartilage defects during arthroscopy, eliminating the need for additional procedures or sample collection. This enables longitudinal evaluation of post-intervention injury development, providing valuable insights into the progression of cartilage damage over time."
