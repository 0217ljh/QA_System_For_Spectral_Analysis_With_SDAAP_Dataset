        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the PLS + ANN algorithm showed better validation prediction performances compared to other algorithms tested. It had a lower standard deviation of cross-validation RMSE and a better normality of the residual distribution. The R(2)v value for the PLS + ANN model was 0.60, and the validation RMSE was 162.17 mg/L of milk.\n\nTherefore, in terms of accuracy, the PLS + ANN algorithm can be considered superior to traditional methods. It provided more accurate predictions of the LF content in milk based on milk mid-infrared spectra."
