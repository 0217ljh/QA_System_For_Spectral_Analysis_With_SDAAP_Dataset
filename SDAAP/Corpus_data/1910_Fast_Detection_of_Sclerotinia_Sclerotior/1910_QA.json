        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly stated whether the image fusion technique used in the related study can be applied to other remote sensing platforms for the early detection of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on oilseed rape leaves. The study specifically mentions the use of an indoor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) low-altitude remote sensing simulation platform for disease detection. However, it does not mention the applicability of the image fusion technique to other remote sensing platforms. Therefore, further research or information would be needed to determine if the technique can be applied to other platforms."
