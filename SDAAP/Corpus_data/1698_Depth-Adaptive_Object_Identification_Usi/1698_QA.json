        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers addressed the depth dependence issue in machine-learning-based object recognition using terahertz band time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) measurements by developing a simple adaptive depth signal conversion scheme. This scheme involved using a calibration object before neural-network-based supervised learning. The researchers conducted experimental validations using several mono- or disaccharides and their THz-TDS data to demonstrate the effectiveness of their compensation scheme in enhancing the recognition ratio."

The study specifically focuses on machine-learning-based object recognition using terahertz (THz) band time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) measurements. Therefore, it is unclear whether the compensation scheme would be applicable to other spectroscopic methods."
