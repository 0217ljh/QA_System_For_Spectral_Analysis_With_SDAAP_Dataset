        "Output": "Yes, the novel approach using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) spectra and machine learning models can be considered superior to traditional methods in classifying the carbon group and predicting carbon content in solid waste. The approach achieved an accuracy above 0.95 and an R2 of 0.96 in the test set, indicating high performance. Additionally, the models were validated using an external test set, which further supports their reliability. The use of HSI spectra and machine learning models provides a rapid and efficient method for characterizing the biogenic carbon share in solid waste without the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive traditional methods."
