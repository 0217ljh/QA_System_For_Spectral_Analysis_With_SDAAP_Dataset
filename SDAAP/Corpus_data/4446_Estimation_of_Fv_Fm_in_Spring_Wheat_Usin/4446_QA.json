The performance of the ARD model was evaluated using the mentioned metrics, and the results were as follows: Test set MAE = 0.019, MSE = 0.001, RMSE = 0.024, R-2 = 0.925, RMSLE = 0.014, MAPE = 0.026. \n\nThese metrics indicate that the ARD model performed well in accurately estimating Fv/Fm, with low errors and high R-squared value, suggesting a strong correlation between the predicted and actual Fv/Fm values."
