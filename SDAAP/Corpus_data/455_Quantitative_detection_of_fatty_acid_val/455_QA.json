        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the portable NIR spectroscopy system combined with appropriate chemometric methods can be considered superior to traditional methods for quantitatively detecting fatty acid values in wheat flour during storage. The past study demonstrates that the portable NIR spectroscopy system, along with the use of standard normal variate (SNV) correction and variable combination population analysis (VCPA), can optimize the characteristic wavelength variables and accurately predict the fatty acid values in wheat flour. The experimental results showed good prediction accuracy and stability, with a mean RP above 0.96. This indicates that the portable NIR spectroscopy system, when combined with chemometric methods, provides a feasible and effective approach for quantitative determination of fatty acid values in wheat flour during storage."
