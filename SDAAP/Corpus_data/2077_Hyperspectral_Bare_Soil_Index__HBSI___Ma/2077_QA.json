        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of bare-soil mapping in this study was the percentage accuracy. The related study states that the Hyperspectral Bare Soil Index (HBSI) achieved over 91% accuracy for both Sentinel-2 and AVIRIS-NG images. Additionally, when the HBSI was combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the accuracy improved to >92% for Sentinel-2 and >97% for AVIRIS-NG images. Therefore, the chosen metric of percentage accuracy was able to assess the performance of the bare-soil mapping with high precision."

        "Output": "Yes, the Hyperspectral Bare Soil Index (HBSI) can be considered superior to traditional methods in accurately mapping bare soil in a complex urban/agricultural region. According to the related study, the HBSI outperformed other existing bare-soil indices with over 91% accuracy for both Sentinel-2 and AVIRIS-NG images. Additionally, when combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the HBSI showed even better performance in bare-soil classification, with >92% accuracy for Sentinel-2 and >97% accuracy for AVIRIS-NG images. The development of HBSI, which incorporates the blue band in addition to the NIR and SWIR2 bands, from the high-spectral-resolution data from AVIRIS-NG, contributes to its improved accuracy in mapping bare soil."
