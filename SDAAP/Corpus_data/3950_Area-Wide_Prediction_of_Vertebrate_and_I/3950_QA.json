        "input": "",
        "Output": "The models for hole density generally performed better than the models for hole depth. The best-performing model was for invertebrate hole density, with an R-2 value of 0.62. The models for hole density at individual study sites in the arid climate zone also showed good performance, with R-2 values of 0.75 and 0.68 for invertebrates and vertebrates, respectively. On the other hand, the models for hole depth only showed good to fair performance."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the consumer-oriented UAV RGB imagery shows potential for determining the density and depth of burrowing animal holes. The study combined UAV data with empirical field plot observations and machine learning techniques to derive spatial layers representing vegetation type and height, as well as landscape textures and diversity. The models developed using these data performed better for predicting hole density compared to hole depth. The best-performing model was for invertebrate hole density, with an R-2 value of 0.62."
