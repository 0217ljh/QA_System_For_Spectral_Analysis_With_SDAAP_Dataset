They compared the results of four different classification models (naive bayes, linear discriminant analysis, extreme learning machine, and support vector machine) and determined the best classification model based on its success rate. The success rates were reported for the total samples, as well as separately for healthy and diseased samples in the validation set."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of full-transmittance spectroscopy in detecting moldy core in apples is more effective compared to traditional methods. Traditional methods rely on visual inspection, which can be difficult as there is no obvious difference in appearance between healthy and diseased fruit. However, full-transmittance spectroscopy allows for the collection of spectral data from apples, which provides more accurate and reliable information for detection.\n\nIn this study, the full-transmittance spectra of apples were collected online using a short-integration-time mode. The spectral intensity of healthy fruit was found to be higher than diseased fruit due to the stronger absorption of damaged tissues. This difference in spectral intensity allowed for the development of classification models, such as naive bayes, linear discriminant analysis, extreme learning machine, and support vector machine, to detect apples with moldy core.\n\nThe results showed that the spectra extracted from the medial zone of the apples resulted in better detection performance compared to intact fruit. Additionally, the T2 orientation was found to be more suitable for moldy core detection. The best classification model was built based on the medial zone spectra collected by T2 orientation, achieving a high success rate of 90.4% for total samples, 86.9% for healthy samples, and 93.9%"
