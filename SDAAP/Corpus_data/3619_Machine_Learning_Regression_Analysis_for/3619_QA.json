        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of the MLR models was the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). \n\nThe Gaussian process regression (GPR) model performed the best among the three models evaluated. It achieved an R-2 value of 0.86, an RMSE of 4.07, and an MAE of 3.21 when compared to the manual seedling count."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning regression (MLR) models, including regression trees, support vector regression, and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were evaluated for estimating wheat seedling emergence using multispectral images captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle. Among these models, the GPR model was found to be the most effective. It achieved an R-2 value of 0.86, indicating a strong correlation between the estimated seedling emergence and the manual seedling count. The GPR model also had a relatively low root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.07 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.21, further indicating its accuracy in estimating wheat seedling emergence."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model can be used in other crops as well. The study mentioned that the method developed for estimating wheat seedlings using multispectral images captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle can be deployed on larger field trials and other crops for effective and reliable seedling emergence estimates. Therefore, the GPR model can be applied to estimate seedling emergence in other crops, not just wheat."
