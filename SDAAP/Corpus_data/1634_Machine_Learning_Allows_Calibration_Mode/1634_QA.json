        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the analytical performances of the model is the average relative error of calibration (REC) and prediction (REP). The text states that the average REC and REP fall within the range of 5-6%. This means that the model's accuracy in predicting trace elements in soils using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy is within 5-6% of the actual values."

        "Output": "The multivariate model developed using machine learning algorithms is more accurate than univariate models for determining trace elements in soils affected by the matrix effect. The text states that univariate models often lead to poor analytical performances, while the multivariate model shows average relative errors of calibration (REC) and of prediction (REP) within the range of 5-6%. This indicates that the multivariate model has higher accuracy in predicting the trace elements in soils compared to the univariate models."
