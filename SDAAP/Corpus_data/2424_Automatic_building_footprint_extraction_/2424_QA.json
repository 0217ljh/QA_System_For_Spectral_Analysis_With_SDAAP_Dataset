        "Output": "The proposed technique utilizes geometric transformation and polygons segmentation in the automated building footprint extraction and road detection process using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for hyperspectral imagery by following these steps:\n\n1. Geometric Transformation: Geometric transformation is applied to the hyperspectral imagery to align and correct any distortions or misalignments in the image. This ensures that the subsequent analysis is performed on accurately registered data.\n\n2. Polygons Segmentation: The polygons segmentation process is employed to identify and extract spectral features in the hyperspectral data. This involves dividing the image into different regions or polygons based on their spectral characteristics. Each polygon represents a distinct object or feature in the image, such as buildings or roads.\n\n3. CNN Feature Extraction: The extracted polygons are then used as input to the CNN. The CNN is trained to convert these compressed features into high-level features that capture the relevant information for classifying objects into buildings and road networks. The CNN learns to recognize patterns and features in the data that are indicative of buildings and roads.\n\n4. Classification using CNN: The trained CNN is then used to classify the extracted spectral features, i.e., building footprints and road detection."
