        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the Random Forest AdaBoost (RFA) regression models in the study was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 values for the estimated plant traits ranged from above 0.80, indicating a good fit between the predicted values and the actual values of the plant traits. Therefore, the R-2 metric was able to provide a measure of how well the RFA regression models could estimate the plant traits, with values above 0.80 indicating a high level of accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, according to the related study, the spectral features Red, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Red-Edge Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (REWDRVI), and Red-Edge Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (RESAVI) were found to be remarkable in estimating all twelve rice plant traits from aerial unmanned vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral images. These spectral features showed high accuracy, with coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging from 0.80-0.99 and root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.04-0.22. Therefore, they can be considered superior to traditional methods in estimating these plant traits."
