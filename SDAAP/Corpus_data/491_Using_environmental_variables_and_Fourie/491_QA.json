        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction performance of the models in the past study was the coefficient of determination (R-squared). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (SOC content) that can be explained by the independent variables (environmental variables and FTIR data). \n\nThe coefficient of determination can range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the predicted and actual values, and a value of 0 indicates no relationship between the variables. \n\nIn the past study, the best prediction performance achieved by the Cubist+Bat model using environmental variables and FTIR spectra (scenario 3) had a coefficient of determination of 0.73. This means that approximately 73% of the variance in SOC content could be explained by the combination of predictors used in the model. \n\nWhile a coefficient of determination of 0.73 indicates a relatively good fit, it also suggests that there is still some unexplained variability in the data. Therefore, there is room for further improvement in the prediction accuracy by considering additional factors or collecting more soil samples, especially in areas with changing land use and topography over short spatial scales."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The combination of environmental variables and FTIR data with the Cubist+Bat model can be considered a superior approach compared to traditional methods in predicting SOC content in semi-arid soils of Iran. According to the study, this approach achieved the best prediction performance, with a coefficient of determination of 0.73 and a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.77. The FTIR data was found to have the highest influence on the prediction accuracy of SOC. Therefore, it can be concluded that using this combination of variables and model is a precise approach for monitoring SOC in semi-arid soils of Iran."
