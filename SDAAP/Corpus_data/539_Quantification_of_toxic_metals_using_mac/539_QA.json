        "Output": "Yes. The developed spark emission spectroscopy system, combined with the LASSO technique, can be considered a superior method compared to traditional approaches for quantifying the concentration of toxic metals targeted by the US EPA. Traditional techniques for detecting and quantifying toxic metals in the atmosphere are either not real-time or limited by instrument costs. However, the spark emission spectroscopy system is a promising and cost-effective technique that can be used for analyzing toxic metals in real-time. By employing the LASSO technique, the system is able to detect useful features from the spark-generated plasma emissions and build a regression model that predicts the concentration of toxic metals from the observed spectra. This combination of low-cost instruments and advanced machine learning techniques allows for more accurate and efficient quantification of toxic metals, making it a superior method compared to traditional approaches."
