        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the estimation of SOC in agricultural lands in low-relief areas was the root mean square error (RMSE). The study found that the evaluated RMSE for mapping SOC in small and large-extent low-relief areas was 0.199% and 0.249% respectively. This indicates that the mapping approach using time series of remote sensing images performed with low errors, suggesting a high level of accuracy in estimating SOC."

        "Output": "The regression techniques used in the estimation of SOC in agricultural lands in low-relief areas were stepwise regression (STR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and extreme learning machine (ELM). In terms of accuracy, the study found that the ELM yielded a better prediction accuracy compared to PLSR and STR."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of SOC mapping using time series of remote sensing images is higher compared to traditional methods in agricultural lands in low-relief areas. The study found that the time series of remote sensing images can be used to map SOC in small and large-extent low-relief areas with low evaluated root mean square errors (0.199% and 0.249%) and high R2 (0.555 and 0.528). This indicates that the predictions made using remote sensing images are more precise and reliable compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the study compared the accuracy of SOC estimations from different satellite datasets and found that the Sentinel-2 time series images exhibited better accuracy compared to Landsat 8 and GF 1 datasets. Therefore, using time series of remote sensing images provides a more accurate and suitable approach for SOC mapping in agricultural lands in low-relief areas compared to traditional methods."
