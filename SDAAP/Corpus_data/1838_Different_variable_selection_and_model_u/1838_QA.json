        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed updating strategy using visible/near-infrared hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy can be effectively explored to differentiate the sex of other new species in the research. The study found that when the updated SiPLS-PLSDA model based on the Kennard Stone (KS) algorithm was used, it achieved the highest performance with 100% accuracy in discriminating the sex of silkworm pupae with different species in the same year. Additionally, the updated model also reached an accuracy of 94.44% when used to discriminate the sex of silkworm pupae with different species in different years. These results indicate that the proposed updating strategy has the potential to effectively differentiate the sex of other new species."
