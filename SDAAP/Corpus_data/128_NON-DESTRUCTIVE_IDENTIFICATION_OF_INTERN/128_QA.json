        "Output": "Yes. The proposed online visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy system can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of improving the commercial value of apples and reducing postharvest costs. \n\nPast study states that watercore is used as an indicator of full ripeness, storage suitability, and price of apples in many countries. Therefore, fast and non-destructive detection of watercore is important in improving the commercial value of apples and reducing postharvest costs. \n\nThe online Vis/NIR spectroscopy system allows for real-time detection of watercore in Fuji apples. The system achieved over 95.0% accuracy in classifying sound apples from those with watercore, using various classification algorithms. The best classification result was achieved by linear kernel SVM, with an accuracy of 96% for total samples. \n\nBy using this system, apples can be screened for watercore quickly and non-destructively, allowing for efficient sorting and grading of apples based on watercore severity. This can help in determining the appropriate price for apples and ensuring that only suitable apples are stored for longer periods, reducing postharvest costs. \n\nTherefore, the proposed online Vis/NIR spectroscopy system can be considered superior to traditional methods."
