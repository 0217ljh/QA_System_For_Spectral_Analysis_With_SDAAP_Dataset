        "Output": "Reflectance images were processed using Python 3 MicaSense image processing workflow and combined in Agisoft Metashape to obtain an orthomosaic. Georeferencing was done with Ground Control Points measured with a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). An Empirical Line Correction was conducted using laboratory measures with a hyperspectral sensor of the 5-panel greyscale."
