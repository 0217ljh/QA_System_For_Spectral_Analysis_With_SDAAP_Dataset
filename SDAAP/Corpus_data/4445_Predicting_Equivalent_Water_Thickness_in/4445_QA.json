        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms in estimating EWT (equivalent water thickness) was the coefficient of determination (R-2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the EWT estimates that can be explained by the ML algorithms. \n\nThe R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the estimated and actual EWT values. In this study, the ML algorithm with the highest R-2 value was the Deep Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron (DNN-MLP), which achieved an R-2 value of 0.934. \n\nThis indicates that the DNN-MLP algorithm was able to explain approximately 93.4% of the variance in the EWT estimates, suggesting a strong performance in estimating EWT. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of R-2 provides a measure of how well the ML algorithms can estimate EWT, and in this case, it shows that the DNN-MLP algorithm performed exceptionally well in estimating EWT."

        "Output": "Yes, based on the results of the study, the DNN-MLP algorithm can be considered as a superior method compared to traditional methods for retrieving equivalent water thickness (EWT) in precision agriculture. The DNN-MLP algorithm demonstrated high performance with an R-2 value of 0.934, NSE value of 0.933, RMSE value of 0.028 g/cm(2), and MAE value of 0.017 g/cm(2). These results indicate that the DNN-MLP algorithm has a high capacity for accurately estimating EWT in wheat crops. This suggests that using machine learning algorithms, specifically the DNN-MLP algorithm, in combination with vegetation indices (VIs) can improve the real-time irrigation efficiency of wheat by quantifying field water content and addressing variability."
