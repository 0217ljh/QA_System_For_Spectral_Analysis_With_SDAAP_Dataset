        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes.Based on the information provided in the related study, the use of affordable and portable fNIRS, in combination with cortical fMRI and simulated fNIRS activity, can be considered a superior spectroscopic method for inferring activity in subcortical regions involved in emotion and arousal. This conclusion is supported by the validation related study conducted on a sample of adolescents diagnosed with PTSD and age-matched healthy controls. The related study showed that the inference of subcortical fMRI activity with cortical fMRI had high prediction performance for the amygdala and hippocampus in both groups. Additionally, using simulated fNIRS data, relatively high prediction performance for deep brain regions was maintained in both healthy controls and youths with PTSD. The linear regression and neural network models provided the best predictions. Therefore, this combined approach of fNIRS and cortical fMRI appears to be a promising method for assessing brain function in subcortical regions involved in emotion and arousal, compared to traditional methods."
