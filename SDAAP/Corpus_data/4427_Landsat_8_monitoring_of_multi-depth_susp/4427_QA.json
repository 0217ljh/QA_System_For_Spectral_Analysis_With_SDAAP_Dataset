        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in this study is the coefficient of determination (R^2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (suspended sediment concentration, SSC) that can be explained by the independent variables (depth intervals). \n\nThe R^2 values obtained from the machine learning models (random forest and model averaged neural network) increased with depth, with a maximum R^2 of 0.89 and 0.83, respectively, at a depth of 0-182 cm. This indicates that the models were able to explain a significant portion of the variance in SSC at different depth intervals. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric (R^2) can go up to a maximum value of 1, indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and observed SSC values."

        "Output": "The performance of the machine learning models (random forest, support vector regression, and model averaged neural network) was significantly better than simple linear least squares regression (LLSR) in estimating suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at different depth intervals in the Maumee River. Among the machine learning models, random forest (RF) performed the best. Both RF and model averaged neural network (MANN) showed an increase in the coefficient of determination (R^2) with depth, with RF achieving a maximum R^2 of 0.89 and MANN achieving a maximum R^2 of 0.83 at a depth of 0-182 cm. These results indicate that the machine learning models were able to capture nonlinear relationships and provide more accurate predictions compared to the traditional linear regression method, especially when the number of available samples was limited."

        "Output": "Yes, the machine learning models (random forest, support vector regression, and model averaged neural network) using the Landsat 8 OLI sensor can be considered superior to the traditional linear regression method (LLSR) in estimating suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at different depth intervals in the Maumee River. The study found that all machine learning models significantly outperformed LLSR, with random forest (RF) performing the best. Both RF and model averaged neural network (MANN) showed higher coefficient of determination (R^2) values, indicating better predictions, compared to LLSR. Therefore, the machine learning models were able to implement nonlinear relationships and produce more accurate estimates of depth-integrated SSC, especially when samples were limited."
