Classification Model: An artificial neural network (ANN) with error back propagation training was used to establish the rock and mineral identification model. The ANN was trained using the spectral data and corresponding rock/mineral labels. This training process allowed the model to learn the patterns and relationships between the spectral features and the rock/mineral types.\n\n4.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of PCA (principal component analysis) and machine learning contributes to the successful classification of different kinds of rocks and minerals using LIBS (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy) in the related study by providing a robust and accurate identification model.\n\nFirstly, PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. This technique helps to reduce the complexity of the spectral data by identifying the most important features or components that contribute to the variance in the dataset. By applying PCA, the data is distributed in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space, allowing for easier visualization and analysis of the differences among the rock samples and minerals.\n\nSecondly, machine learning algorithms, specifically the error back propagation training artificial neural network, are employed. The neural network is trained using the spectral data and their corresponding rock types or mineral classifications. The network learns the patterns and relationships between the spectral features and the rock types/minerals, enabling it to make accurate predictions or classifications.\n\nBy combining PCA and machine learning, the study establishes a rock and mineral identification model. This model takes advantage of the dimensionality reduction provided by PCA and the learning capabilities of the neural network. As a result, the recognition rate of the model reaches 100%, indicating that it can successfully classify different kinds of rocks and minerals based on their spectral signatures."
