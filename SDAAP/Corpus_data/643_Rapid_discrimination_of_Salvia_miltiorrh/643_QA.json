        "Output": "The researchers improved the classification ability of the KELM model by using two methods of random forest (RF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as variable selection methods. These methods were employed to eliminate useless information and enhance the classification ability of the KELM model. By using the PSO-KELM model, the researchers achieved a better classification result with a classification accuracy of 94.87%. Comparing the results with those obtained by particle swarm optimization-least squares support vector machines (PSO-LSSVM) and PSO-RF models, the PSO-KELM model demonstrated the best classification performance."

        "Output": "The combination of LIBS technique and PSO-KELM method is more effective in the classification and identification of Salvia miltiorrhiza samples in different regions compared to traditional methods. The results of the related study showed that the PSO-KELM model had a classification accuracy of 94.87%, which was higher than the results obtained by other traditional methods such as PSO-LSSVM and PSO-RF. This indicates that the PSO-KELM model outperformed these traditional methods in terms of classification performance. Therefore, the combination of LIBS technique and PSO-KELM method shows promise as a more effective approach for the classification and identification of Salvia miltiorrhiza samples in different regions."
