        "Output": "In this research, the ensemble learning strategy is introduced to enhance the classical support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) classifiers in order to improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing images.\n\nEnsemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple individual classifiers to make more accurate predictions. In this study, the ensemble learning strategy is used to improve the performance of the SVM and BPNN classifiers.\n\nThe ensemble learning strategy works by training multiple SVM and BPNN classifiers on different subsets of the training data. Each individual classifier in the ensemble is trained to specialize in a specific aspect of the data. By combining the predictions of these individual classifiers, the ensemble is able to make more accurate and robust predictions.\n\nThe ensemble learning strategy helps to overcome the limitations of individual classifiers by reducing bias and variance. It helps to capture different aspects of the complex spectrum area in remote sensing images by combining the spectral information with texture features extracted using gray-level co-occurrence matrix and Gabor filters group.\n\nBy introducing the ensemble learning strategy, the classification accuracy of the classical SVM and BPNN classifiers is significantly improved compared to using these classifiers individually. The ensemble learning strategy also helps to enhance the running efficiency of the classifiers, making the classification process more efficient."
