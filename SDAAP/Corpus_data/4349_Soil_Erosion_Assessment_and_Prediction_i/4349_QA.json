        "Output": "The metric chosen to calculate soil erosion loss in the related study was the G2 erosion model. This model is based on the synthesis of the equation from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Erosion Potential Method (EPM). \n\nIn terms of assessing the impact of soil degradation, the G2 erosion model provides a quantitative measure of soil loss in tons per hectare per year (t/ha/yr). This metric allows researchers to compare soil erosion rates between different areas and time periods."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning techniques were used in the analysis of soil erosion and land cover in the Master Plan of Belgrade by applying the random forest algorithm to multispectral satellite images of the Landsat mission. This algorithm, along with spectral indices, was used to identify and classify different land cover types. By using machine learning, the researchers were able to analyze and track changes in land cover over time, which served as a dynamic indicator of the urbanization process. This approach allowed for a more accurate assessment of soil erosion and its impact on the environment in the study area."
