        "Output": "Yes, prefrontal functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional machine learning algorithms for the objective and quantitative assessment of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) using a stop-signal task (SST). The research mentioned in the text used fNIRS to assess inhibitory control in patients with IGD and found that deep learning algorithms (DL) outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms (ML) in classifying subjects into healthy controls and gaming disorder groups. Specifically, the two-dimensional convolution neural network (2D-CNN) achieved the highest accuracy of 87.5% among all models tested. This suggests that the use of fNIRS and DL models, such as 2D-CNN, can effectively predict and identify patients with IGD, making it a reliable and accurate method for diagnosis."
