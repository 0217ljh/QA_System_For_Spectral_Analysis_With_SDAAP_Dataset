        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the aflatoxin detection method was the accuracy rate of 5-fold cross validation of the support vector machine (SVM). This metric measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. In this case, the accuracy rate was reported to be 95.5%."

        "Output": "The researchers combined hyperspectral imaging technology with machine learning to detect aflatoxin contamination in peanut kernels by using a support vector machine (SVM) based detection method. They prepared five concentrations of aflatoxin solutions and dripped them onto the surface of different peanut kernels. Hyperspectral images with 33 bands were acquired for each sample using a hyperspectral imaging system under 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light. They then proposed four fluorescence indexes and used the Fisher method to optimize and obtain a narrowband spectrum. Finally, they used an RBF-SVM model to recognize aflatoxin and make regression analysis on the degree of aflatoxin contamination. The experimental results showed that the DRI index had the best performance, with an accuracy rate of 95.5% in 5-fold cross validation."
