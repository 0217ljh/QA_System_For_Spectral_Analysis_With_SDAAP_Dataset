        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the classification model developed in the study is the overall accuracy. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. In the related study, the overall accuracy achieved was more than 96.8%.\n\nThe overall accuracy metric provides a measure of how well the model performs in classifying the different water categories and algal blooms. It indicates the reliability and effectiveness of the developed method in detecting and correctly classifying the onset of blooms and identifying the bloom species in Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal waters using remote sensing data.\n\nWhile the study reports a high overall accuracy of over 96.8%, it does not provide information on the potential limitations or the extent to which this metric can go. Further research and validation may be required to assess the model's performance in different environmental conditions, with varying levels of algal blooms, and using data from other ocean color sensors."
