        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it can be inferred that the spectroscopic method used in this research is considered superior to traditional methods for measuring the Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration in urban water bodies. The related study states that the NIR band of the UAV image is highly sensitive to TSM concentration, indicating that the spectroscopic method using multi-spectral images can effectively measure TSM. Additionally, the related study mentions that the TSM regression model is more stable and explanatory than the machine learning model when the sample size is small. This suggests that the spectroscopic method provides more reliable and accurate results compared to traditional methods."
