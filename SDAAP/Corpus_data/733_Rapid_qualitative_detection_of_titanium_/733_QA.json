        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of Raman spectroscopy integrated with machine learning, specifically the one-dimensional stack auto encoder convolutional neural network (1D-SAE-CNN), has shown to be a promising method in detecting titanium dioxide adulteration in dried persimmon icing. Compared to traditional methods, such as extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), and random forest (RF) models, the 1D-SAE-CNN approach provided the highest detection accuracy of 0.9825, precision of 0.9824, recall of 0.9825, and f1-score of 0.9824. This indicates that Raman spectroscopy coupled with 1D-SAE-CNN is a more effective and reliable method for identifying titanium dioxide adulteration in persimmon icing compared to traditional techniques."
