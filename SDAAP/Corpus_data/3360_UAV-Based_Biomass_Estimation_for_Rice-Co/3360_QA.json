        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the estimation accuracy of rice biomass in the related study is the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics provide a quantitative measure of how well the estimated biomass values align with the actual biomass values.\n\nThe study found that models that include structural and meteorological features achieved higher R-2 values (0.86) compared to models that only used spectral features (0.64). Additionally, the RMSE and MAE values were lower for models that included structural and meteorological features (178.37 g/m(2) and 127.34 g/m(2) respectively) compared to models that did not include these features (286.79 g/m(2) and 236.49 g/m(2) respectively).\n\nBased on these results, it can be concluded that the inclusion of structural and meteorological features improves the estimation accuracy of rice biomass."

        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning models, specifically the random forest model, were utilized to estimate rice above ground biomass (AGB). The random forest model was one of the three models used, along with simple linear regression (SLR) and simple exponential regression (SER) models. By incorporating structural and meteorological features along with widely used spectral features, the random forest model, along with the other models, aimed to improve the accuracy of estimating rice AGB."
