The RF model performed better than the MARS model in terms of these metrics. The RF model had an R-2 of 0.86, RMSE of 1.83, and RPD of 2.7, while the MARS model had an R-2 of 0.81, RMSE of 4.8, and RPD of 1.96."

The RF model achieved a higher accuracy estimation with a cross-validation determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.86, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.83, and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 2.7. In comparison, the MARS model had an R-2 of 0.81, RMSE of 4.8, and RPD of 1.96. Therefore, the RF model outperformed the MARS model in the related study."

        "Output": "Yes, the random forest (RF) regression model can be considered superior to traditional methods for predicting and mapping soil salinity in highly vegetated and slightly salt-affected croplands. The study showed that the RF model achieved a higher accuracy estimation compared to the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model. The RF model had a cross-validation determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.86, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.83, and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 2.7, which were better than the corresponding values for the MARS model (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 4.8, and RPD = 1.96). Therefore, based on the higher accuracy estimation achieved in this study, the RF model can be considered superior for predicting and mapping soil salinity in highly vegetated and slightly salt-affected croplands."
