        "Output": "Yes, the spectral feature processing methods used in the related study can be considered superior to traditional methods for distinguishing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on hemodynamic fluctuations. The study utilized sample entropy (SampEn) of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a feature variable to assess the pattern of mind-wandering in children with ASD. The results showed that the SampEn of fNIRS could accurately distinguish ASD, with a classification accuracy of 97.6%. This suggests that the spectral feature processing methods used in the related study are highly effective in distinguishing ASD based on hemodynamic fluctuations."
