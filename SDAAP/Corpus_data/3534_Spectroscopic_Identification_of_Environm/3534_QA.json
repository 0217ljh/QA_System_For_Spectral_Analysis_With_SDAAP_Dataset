        "Output": "Yes, the proposed robust classifier using spectral analysis can effectively differentiate the chemical types of environmental microplastics (MPs) samples. It surpasses the traditional approach of matching with spectral reference libraries by introducing an adaptive estimator in the developed k-nearest neighbor (kNN) model as the hard threshold. This adaptive estimator helps to classify the environmental MPs by effectively eliminating the interference of spectral distortions and diversity. The recognition rate of the proposed classifier is higher than 0.97, indicating its high accuracy in identifying the chemical types of environmental MPs samples."
