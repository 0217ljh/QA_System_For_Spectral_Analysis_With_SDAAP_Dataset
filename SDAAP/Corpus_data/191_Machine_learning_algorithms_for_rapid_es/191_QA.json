Additionally, the advanced GBM algorithms (LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost) perform better than the classical ML algorithms. Specifically, models built by CatBoost and XGBoost demonstrate high predictive accuracy, with a test R(2) above 0.93 and a test RMSE less than 0.29%. This suggests that ML algorithms using Raman spectroscopy provide a more accurate estimation of holocellulose content in poplar compared to traditional methods."
