        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, the researchers used a machine learning model called residual neural network (ResNet) to identify different drying methods and regions of Eucommia ulmoides leaf (EULs). They combined ResNet with two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) based on Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy.\n\nFirst, the researchers performed exploratory analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis to cluster samples from different regions and drying methods. They found that samples from the same region clustered together better than samples from different drying methods.\n\nNext, they obtained a total of 3204 2DCOS images and compared synchronous 2DCOS, asynchronous 2DCOS, and integrated 2DCOS for the identification and analysis of EULs. They concluded that synchronous 2DCOS was more suitable for this purpose.\n\nThen, the researchers used the ResNet model with synchronous 2DCOS to identify different drying methods and regions of EULs. They compared the performance of ResNet with the partial least squares discriminant model. The ResNet model achieved 100% accuracy in the train set, test set, and external verification, indicating its superiority over the partial least squares discriminant model.\n\nFinally, the researchers conducted correlation analysis of 19 climate data and different regions."
