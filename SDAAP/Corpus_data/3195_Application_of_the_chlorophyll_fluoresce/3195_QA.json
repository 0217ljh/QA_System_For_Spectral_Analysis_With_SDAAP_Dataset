        "Output": "The metric chosen to establish the correlation between fluorescence intensity ratios and the dose of N fertilization is the fluorescence intensity ratios themselves, specifically F685/F460, F735/F460, and F735/F685. These ratios were measured and analyzed to determine their correlation with the dose of N fertilization."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The back-propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm was used in the analysis of nitrogen fertilization levels in paddy rice using the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique by classifying the different N fertilization levels based on the fluorescence characteristics (FLCs) measured by the LIF system. The correlation between fluorescence intensity ratios (F685/F460, F735/F460, and F735/F685) and the dose of N fertilization was established and analyzed. The BPNN algorithm was then utilized to validate that the different N fertilization levels can be classified based on these FLCs. The overall identification accuracies of 2014 and 2015 were 90% and 92.5%, respectively. This demonstrates that the BPNN algorithm, in combination with the LIF technique, can effectively classify and analyze the nitrogen fertilization levels in paddy rice."
