        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, the contributions of different spectral plant and soil traits to the computed stress signal were analyzed using an unsupervised learning method called simplex volume maximization (SiVM). SiVM is an interpretable matrix factorization technique that was applied to derive typical extreme spectra, known as archetypes, from the hyperspectral data. These archetypes represent different stress levels in the grassland ecosystem.\n\nBy classifying the archetypes, the researchers were able to infer qualitative drought stress levels. The results of this classification were then evaluated using a set of geophysical measurements and vegetation indices as proxy variables for drought-inhibited vegetation growth.\n\nTo assess the importance of different spectral plant and soil traits in contributing to the computed stress signal, boosted beta regression was used. This analysis helped identify the predictor variables that had the highest coefficient values in the interannual stress model. Among these variables, carotenoid-related variables were found to have significant contributions.\n\nThe study also highlighted the significance of the photochemical reflectance index that uses 512 nm as a reference wavelength (PRI512) in combining imaging spectrometry and unsupervised learning for vegetation stress monitoring. This index demonstrated the potential of using archetypical reflectance spectra for remote estimation of photosynthetic efficiency."
