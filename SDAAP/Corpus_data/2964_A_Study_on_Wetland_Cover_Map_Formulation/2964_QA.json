        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, three machine learning models were employed to classify centimeter-scale images of wetlands using multispectral and hyperspectral techniques. These models were:\n\n1. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM): This model was one of the classification methods used in the study. Its accuracy and detection outcomes were compared to the other models.\n\n2. Support Vector Machine (SVM): This model was another classification method employed in the study. Its accuracy and detection outcomes were also compared to the other models.\n\n3. Artificial Neural Network (ANN): This model was the third classification method used in the study. Its accuracy and detection outcomes were compared to the other models as well.\n\nTo compare the accuracy and detection outcomes of these models, two data sampling methods (endmember and pixel sampling) were employed to acquire data. The accuracy and detection outcomes of the models were then compared based on the classification results obtained using these data sampling techniques. The findings of the study revealed that the pixel-based sampling method was more effective, showing a notable difference of 38.62% compared to the endmember sampling method."
