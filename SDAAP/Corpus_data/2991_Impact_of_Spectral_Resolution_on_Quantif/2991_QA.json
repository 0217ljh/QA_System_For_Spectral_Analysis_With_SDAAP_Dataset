        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine-learning models on the detection of phycocyanin pigments in cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms is the median error. The median error represents the difference between the predicted values of phycocyanin (PC) obtained from the machine-learning models and the actual PC values measured in the in situ radiometric spectra. \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the study reports that the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model applied to hyperspectral data with a spectral configuration similar to the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) achieved median errors of less than 65%. This indicates that the MLP model was able to estimate PC values with a relatively high level of accuracy. \n\nFurthermore, when the MLP model was applied to resampled data from existing satellite instruments and the proposed band configuration for the next Landsat sensor, the median errors ranged between approximately 73% and 126%. Although these errors are higher compared to the HICO configuration, the results still demonstrate tangible improvements compared to retrievals from multispectral data and benchmark algorithms. \n\nOverall, the chosen metric of median error provides a quantitative measure of the accuracy of the machine-learning models in estimating PC values, and the results suggest that the MLP model shows promise for developing a globally applicable cyanobacteria measurement approach."

The MLP neural network applied to the spectral configuration of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of < 6 nm achieved median errors of less than 65%. This outperformed other machine-learning models and benchmark algorithms.
