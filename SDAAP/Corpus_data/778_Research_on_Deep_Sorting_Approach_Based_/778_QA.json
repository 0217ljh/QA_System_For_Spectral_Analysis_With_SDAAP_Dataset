        "Output": "Yes, based on the findings of the related study, the use of infrared spectra and machine learning classification models can be considered superior to traditional methods for achieving the deep separation of residual wastes in municipal solid waste. The related study demonstrated that by combining infrared spectra and machine learning algorithms, the sorting models achieved high accuracy in classifying and identifying different types of residual wastes, such as cellulose, vinyl-polymers, woods, and low-value wastes. The average accuracy of the sorting models ranged from 93.8% to 98.1%, with the highest accuracy achieved by the probabilistic neural network (PNN) model. This indicates that the combination of infrared spectroscopy and machine learning has the potential to provide a fast and accurate deep separation of residual wastes, surpassing traditional methods."
