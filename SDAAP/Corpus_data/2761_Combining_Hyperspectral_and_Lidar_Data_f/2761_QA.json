        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of hyperspectral and lidar systems for vegetation mapping in the Florida Everglades outperforms traditional methods. The study found that using both hyperspectral and lidar data together significantly increased the classification accuracy compared to using hyperspectral data alone. The integration of lidar elevation and intensity features from the original point cloud data helped to avoid errors and uncertainties associated with roster-based lidar methods. The study achieved an overall accuracy of 86 percent and a Kappa value of 0.82 using a synergy of hyperspectral imagery with all lidar-derived features. This demonstrates the promise of the synergy of hyperspectral and lidar systems for mapping complex wetlands like the Florida Everglades."
