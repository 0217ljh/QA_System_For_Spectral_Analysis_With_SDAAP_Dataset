        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate the parameters indicative of muscular activity and fatigue in the related study was the average rectified value (ARV) and the median frequency of the power spectral density (MDF). These metrics were estimated through several machine learning (ML) approaches applied to features obtained from infrared thermal imaging (IRI). The estimation performance of these metrics was found to be good, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.886 (p < 0.001) for ARV and 0.661 (p < 0.001) for MDF."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the use of infrared thermal imaging (IRI) and machine learning (ML) approaches can be considered as a potential alternative to traditional methods in estimating parameters indicative of muscular activity and fatigue, as assessed by electromyography (EMG). The study utilized IRI to measure the temperature of the vastus medialis muscle during bodyweight squats, while ML approaches were applied to IRI features to estimate EMG parameters such as the average rectified value (ARV) and the median frequency of the power spectral density (MDF).\n\nThe results of the study showed good estimation performances for both ARV and MDF (r = 0.886, p < 0.001 for ARV, and r = 0.661, p < 0.001 for MDF) when using IRI and ML approaches. This suggests a potential link between skin temperature and muscle activity and fatigue."
