        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models used in the related study is the root mean squared error (RMSE). The RMSE measures the average magnitude of the prediction errors, indicating how close the predicted values are to the actual values. \n\nIn terms of assessing the accuracy of SOC estimation, the RMSE provides a measure of the overall prediction error. A lower RMSE value indicates a better fit between the predicted and actual values, suggesting higher accuracy in SOC estimation."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study evaluated the performance of the machine learning models by using several evaluation metrics. These metrics included the root mean squared error (RMSE), the coefficient of determination (R2), the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ), and the mean absolute error (MAE). The models used in the study were partial least square regression (PLSR), extreme gradient boosting (EGB), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and regularized random forest (RFF). The performance of the models was compared using these metrics to assess their accuracy in estimating and mapping soil organic content (SOC) in the erosion-prone agricultural field. The results showed that the three merged datasets with EGB performed the best, with higher R2 values, lower RMSE values, lower MAE values, and higher RPIQ values compared to the best separate dataset."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of UAV-borne imagery coupled with auxiliary datasets, such as spectral indices (SPIs) and terrain attributes (TAs), has shown to be more effective in estimating and mapping soil organic content (SOC) compared to traditional methods in an erosion-prone agricultural field. \n\nIn this study, the researchers collected field samples and acquired UAV imagery while the fields were bare, minimizing the effects of vegetation cover. They used various models, including partial least square regression (PLSR), extreme gradient boosting (EGB), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and regularised random forest (RFF), to estimate and map SOC.\n\nThe models were evaluated using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that the three merged datasets (UAV imagery, SPIs, and TAs) outperformed the best separate dataset in terms of prediction accuracy.\n\nThe merged datasets with EGB showed a less extreme prediction error and achieved high accuracy in estimating SOC. The study concluded that using completely bare soil UAV imagery with other auxiliary data is highly recommended for accurately estimating SOC in erosion-prone agricultural fields."
