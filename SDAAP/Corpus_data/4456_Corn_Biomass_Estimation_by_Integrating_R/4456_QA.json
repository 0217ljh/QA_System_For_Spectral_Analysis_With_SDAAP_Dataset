        "Output": "The results of the related study demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques for large-scale estimation of daily corn biomass in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, China in several ways:\n\n1. Accurate estimation: The four machine learning models (RF, SVM, ANN, and XGBoost) were able to accurately estimate the corn biomass, with coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging from 0.72 to 0.78. This indicates that the machine learning models can provide reliable estimates of corn biomass.\n\n2. Comparative performance: Among the four models, the XGBoost model performed the best, with an R-2 value of 0.78, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.86 t/ha, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.86 t/ha. The RF model also showed effective performance, with an R-2 value of 0.77, RMSE of 2.91 t/ha, and MAE of 1.91 t/ha. These results demonstrate that machine learning techniques can achieve accurate estimation of corn biomass at a large scale.\n\n3. Reference for dataset: The study provides a reference for estimating crop biomass from MOD43A4 datasets."
