The average accuracy of the training set was higher than 96% and the average accuracy of the testing set was higher than 84%. This indicates that the method is able to accurately classify soybean varieties.\n\nIn terms of computation cost, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network (T-S fuzzy neural network) model, which is part of the proposed method, is considered the best choice. It offers better stability and less computation cost compared to other models such as soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA), partial squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and genetic algorithm optimized BP neural network (GA-BP). \n\nTherefore, the proposed method combining spectral information and machine learning not only provides high accuracy in classifying soybean varieties but also offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution compared to traditional methods."
