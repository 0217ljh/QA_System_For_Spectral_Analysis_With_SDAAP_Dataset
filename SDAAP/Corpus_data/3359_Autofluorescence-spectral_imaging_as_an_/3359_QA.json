The study showed that autofluorescence signals from specific excitation-emission combinations were able to efficiently segregate treatments and demonstrate a strong correlation with quality indicators such as early germination and seed tolerance to stressful conditions. The machine learning models developed in the study, using artificial neural network, support vector machine, or linear discriminant analysis, showed high performance in classifying seeds with different quality levels. Therefore, the combination of autofluorescence-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithms offers a rapid and non-destructive approach for accurately classifying soybean seeds based on their physiological quality."
