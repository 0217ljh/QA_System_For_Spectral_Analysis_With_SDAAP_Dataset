        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate the concentration of TiO2 in the cementitious surface is the root mean square error (RMSE). The study reports that the best-performing algorithms produced TiO2 concentration estimates with a ~6% RMSE. \n\nThe RMSE is a commonly used metric to measure the difference between predicted values and actual values. It provides a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in the estimates. In this study, a ~6% RMSE suggests that, on average, the TiO2 concentration estimates deviated from the actual values by approximately 6%.\n\nAs for how far this metric can go, it is important to note that the interpretation of the RMSE depends on the context and specific requirements of the application. In general, a lower RMSE indicates higher accuracy and better performance of the estimation model."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine-learning-based algorithms in the remote sensing technique proposed to estimate the concentration of TiO2 in the cementitious surface were trained using cement cores of varying TiO2 concentration and carbon contents. These cement cores were prepared and their surfaces were observed using a directional hyperspectral sensor called TriOS RAMSES. The data collected from these observations were then used to train the algorithms to estimate the TiO2 concentration under different base material conditions."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed remote sensing technique using a hyperspectral sensor is compared to traditional methods in terms of accurately estimating the concentration of TiO2 in cementitious surfaces. The study found that the machine-learning-based algorithms trained with the hyperspectral sensor produced TiO2 concentration estimates with a root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 6% and a correlation close to 0.8. This indicates that the remote sensing technique using the hyperspectral sensor is able to estimate the TiO2 concentration with high accuracy. In comparison, traditional methods may involve destructive testing or other techniques that may not provide as accurate or non-destructive results. Therefore, the proposed remote sensing technique offers a more efficient and accurate way to estimate the concentration of TiO2 in cementitious surfaces compared to traditional methods."
