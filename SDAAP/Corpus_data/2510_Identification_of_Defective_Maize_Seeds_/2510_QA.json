        "Output": "Yes, the proposed CNN-FES method for feature wavelength selection can be used to improve defect detection in maize seeds using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology combined with deep learning. The study found that the subset of 24 feature wavelengths selected by the CNN-FES method was more effective in capturing important feature information in the spectral data compared to other algorithms. This suggests that using the CNN-FES method can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of defect detection in maize seeds using HSI technology and deep learning."
