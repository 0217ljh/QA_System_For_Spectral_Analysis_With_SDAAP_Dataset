        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, the untargeted metabolomics pipeline using LC-MS profiling can be considered superior to genetic-based classification methods for the classification of Humulus lupulus samples and the discovery of marker compounds. The text states that the metabolome-based classification showed an expected difference compared to genetic-based classification data, indicating that the metabolomics approach provided more accurate classification results. Additionally, the pipeline identified nine compounds with significant classification power, five of which were identified as known hops bitter compounds through database search and molecular network construction. This suggests that the untargeted metabolomics pipeline using LC-MS profiling is effective in discovering marker compounds in Humulus lupulus samples."
