        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is possible to apply the integrated spectral-structural workflow developed in this research to other regions for classifying invasive vegetation species using unmanned aircraft systems and machine learning. The related paper presents a workflow that utilizes visible and multispectral images captured by unmanned aircraft systems and processed using a structure from motion workflow. The derived datasets are then used as inputs in machine learning classifications. The results show that including structural layers in the classification improves overall accuracy compared to using spectral information alone. Therefore, this workflow can potentially be adapted and applied to other regions to classify invasive vegetation species using similar remote sensing platforms and machine learning techniques."
