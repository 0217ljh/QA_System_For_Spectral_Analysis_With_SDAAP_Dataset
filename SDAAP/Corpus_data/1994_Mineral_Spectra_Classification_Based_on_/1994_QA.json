        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed mineral spectrum classification method based on a one-dimensional dilated convolutional neural network (1D-DCNN) outperforms traditional mineral spectrum classification methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the experimental results indicate that the 1D-DCNN model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.32%. This accuracy is superior to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The 1D-DCNN model is able to fully learn mineral spectral features and implement a fine classification result, demonstrating good robustness and scalability.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, the 1D-DCNN model offers advantages over traditional methods. The traditional classification methods require complex spectral pretreatment, which may cause a partial loss of spectral information and reduce classification accuracy. Additionally, the operation process is complex, leading to low efficiency. In contrast, the 1D-DCNN model extracts data features layer by layer and combines them to form higher-level semantic information. This deep learning approach has a strong capability of model formulation and great potential for the analysis of spectral data. The proposed method implements end-to-end discrimination of mineral species, eliminating the need for complex pretreatment and streamlining the classification process."
