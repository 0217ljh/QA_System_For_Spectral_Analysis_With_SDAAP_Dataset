        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the classification accuracy of the smoke types in the identification system by using two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). They analyzed the spectra of the three types of smoke using principal component analysis (PCA) to identify characteristic lines and obtain detailed elemental information. The contribution rate of the first two major components in the PCA analysis was found to be 81.6% in total. The accuracy of classification by RF was determined to be 87.5%, while SVM achieved a classification accuracy of 91.7%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the identification system in classifying the different types of smoke generated by Chinese medicine fumigation."

Based on the information provided in the related study, the developed system based on LIBS and machine learning shows promising potential for online in situ detection of air components and classification of smoke generated by Chinese medicine fumigation. The system achieved a classification accuracy of 87.5% using random forest (RF) and 91.7% using support vector machine (SVM). This suggests that the developed system may be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting and classifying the smoke generated by Chinese medicine fumigation."
