        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction accuracy of SOC (soil organic carbon) using on-line vis-NIR spectroscopy is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value ranges from 0.60 to 0.82, indicating that the models can explain 60% to 82% of the variability in the SOC data. The RMSE values range from 5.7 to 16.1 g kg(-1), which represents the average difference between the predicted and actual SOC values. Therefore, the chosen metric can provide a measure of the prediction accuracy of SOC using on-line vis-NIR spectroscopy, but it does not provide information on the absolute accuracy of the predictions."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the results of the related study, the OSC algorithm can be considered as a superior spectral feature processing method in removing the moisture content effect on the prediction accuracy of soil organic carbon (SOC) using on-line visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy. The study compared the performances of four algorithms (DS, PDS, EPO, and OSC) and found that models after EPO, PDS, and OSC corrections resulted in improved accuracy compared to the non-corrected (NC) models. Specifically, the OSC-M5Rules model obtained the highest accuracy, followed by the EPO-M5Rules and NC-M5Rules models, outperforming all PLSR, RF, and SVM models. Therefore, the study suggests that on-line vis-NIR spectra should be corrected with the OSC algorithm before calibrating a machine learning model for accurate prediction of SOC."
