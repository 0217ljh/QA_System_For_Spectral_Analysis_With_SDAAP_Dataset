        "input": "",
        "Output": "No, the proposed method using fine-resolution satellite imagery is specifically designed for monitoring asphalt pavement aging phenomena. The existing studies mostly focus on extracting pavement damages such as cracks, but the proposed method is different and aims to investigate pavement aging conditions. Therefore, it is not directly applicable for monitoring other types of pavement damages like cracks."
