        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed ensemble learning algorithm aims to address the issues of poor generalization ability and model reliability in practical applications of NIR spectroscopy models. It does so by combining multiple regression models to create a more robust and accurate prediction model.\n\nTo improve the generalization ability, the algorithm takes into account the small sample problem typically associated with NIR analysis. Instead of relying on a single regression model, the ensemble learning algorithm combines multiple models, each trained on different subsets of the data. This helps to reduce the risk of overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.\n\nIn terms of model reliability, the algorithm incorporates a novel interpretation method that combines model-agnostic explanation techniques with spectral structure knowledge. This allows for a better understanding of the variable contribution of wavelength variables, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the model in practical applications.\n\nAdditionally, the algorithm introduces a novel reliability index (RI) to further enhance model reliability. This index helps to assess the reliability of the model's predictions and provides a measure of confidence in the model's performance.\n\nOverall, the proposed ensemble learning algorithm addresses the challenges of poor generalization ability and model reliability in NIR spectroscopy models by combining multiple models, incorporating interpretation methods, and introducing a reliability index. This approach improves the model's ability"
