        "Output": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of identifying perceived speech from listeners' brain signals using functional-near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging technique. The study aims to demonstrate the potential of fNIRS as a tool for building a speech decoding brain-computer interface and developing a new type of neural prosthetic system."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers overcame the variability in fNIRS signals among subjects by adopting a generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) to extract latent variables that are shared among the listeners. This approach helped to account for differences in head size, head shape, and spatial locations of brain functional regions. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for dimension reduction, and logistic regression was used for classification."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, according to the results of the study, functional-near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used to identify perceived speech from listeners' brain signals. The study used fNIRS to monitor the prefrontal and parietal cortices of participants while they listened to audio clips containing English stories. Machine learning techniques were then applied to predict which part of a story was being listened to based on the brain's hemodynamic response as measured by fNIRS. The study achieved an average accuracy of 74.7% for differentiating between two 50-second story segments and 43.6% for differentiating four 25-second story segments. These results suggest the potential of using fNIRS as a basis for building a speech decoding brain-computer-interface and developing a new type of neural prosthetic system."
