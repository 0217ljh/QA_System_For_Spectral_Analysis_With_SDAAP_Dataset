        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess human performance in the study is the functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology. This technology measures changes in blood oxygenation levels in the brain, providing an objective measure of cognitive workload and mental states. By using fNIRS, the researchers aim to reduce subjective bias in human performance measurement (HPM) and seafarer certification.\n\nHowever, the extent to which this metric can reduce subjective bias in HPM and seafarer certification is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. Further information or research would be needed to determine the effectiveness of fNIRS in reducing subjective bias in these areas."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The new psychophysiological data-driven machine learning method addresses the subjective bias introduced by assessors in human performance measurement (HPM) and seafarer certification in the maritime sector by conducting experiments using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology. This method compares the performance of two groups, experienced and inexperienced seafarers, in terms of different qualifications by certificates. The data collected through fNIRS technology provides objective and quantifiable measurements of human response under specific missions. These measurements serve as an index for maritime authorities to monitor, assess, and support seafarer training and certification. By using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the method eliminates the subjective bias introduced by assessors and provides an effective and reliable evaluation of human performance in the maritime sector."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the new psychophysiological data-driven machine learning method for human performance measurement (HPM) in the maritime sector can be enhanced by incorporating spectroscopic methods to further reduce subjective bias introduced by assessors in HPM and seafarer certification. The use of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) technology in the experiments conducted in the study demonstrates the potential of spectroscopic methods in objectively measuring and evaluating human response under specific missions. By incorporating spectroscopic methods into the machine learning model, it is possible to obtain more accurate and unbiased assessments of seafarer performance, reducing the subjective bias introduced by assessors. This enhancement can contribute to the development of a more effective HPM system and improve seafarer certification processes in the maritime sector."
