        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning algorithm contributes to the accurate identification of NGPCL in Anhui province in 2019 by utilizing the multi-source remote sensing data and analyzing the spatial patterns of NGPCL. The algorithm is trained on the data to recognize the specific characteristics and spectral features associated with NGPCL. By using the Google Earth engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, the algorithm can process a large amount of data quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe algorithm considers various features such as terrain features, radar features, texture features, and spectral features with red edges and without red edges. It evaluates the importance of these features and determines their contribution to the identification of NGPCL. The results show that spectral features have the highest importance, indicating that they play a crucial role in accurately identifying NGPCL.\n\nBy analyzing the spatial patterns of NGPCL from the perspective of economic development level and topography, the algorithm can identify areas with high economic development levels and flat terrain where NGPCL is more likely to occur. This information helps in understanding the factors influencing the occurrence of NGPCL and aids in effective management of cultivated land resources."
