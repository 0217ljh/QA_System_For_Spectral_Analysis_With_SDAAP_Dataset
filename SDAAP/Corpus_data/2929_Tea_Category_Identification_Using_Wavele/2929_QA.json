        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers improved the lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model by using wavelet feature figures generated through wavelet time-frequency signal decomposition and reconstruction. They used the redundant discrete wavelet transform to decompose the wavelet components of the hyperspectral images of the three types of tea (black tea, green tea, and yellow tea) to construct the datasets. This improved CNN model was then used to generate the tea recognition model."

        "Output": "Yes, the tea recognition method based on the lightweight CNN-SVM (L-CNN-SVM) using wavelet feature figures can be considered superior to traditional methods in accurately recognizing different types of tea and providing technical support for tea grading and quality assessment. The research mentioned in the related study demonstrated that the L-CNN-SVM method outperformed other models such as MobileNet v2+RF, MobileNet v2+KNN, MobileNet v2+AdaBoost, AlexNet, and MobileNet v2. The overall accuracy rate of tea recognition using the L-CNN-SVM method reached 98.7%, which was significantly higher than other combinations of wavelet components. This method can provide new inspiration and technical support for the grade and quality assessment of different types of tea."
