        "Output": "The metric chosen to detect abandoned crops in the Valencian Community (Spain) was the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI). This metric can go as far as distinguishing active from abandoned classes with higher accuracies for crops with very distinctive variations in terms of phenological parameters and vegetation cover."

        "Output": "Yes, the proposed methodology using Sentinel-2 features can be considered superior to traditional methods in detecting abandoned crops in the Valencian Community (Spain) using remote sensing data. The study found that the approach achieved an overall accuracy of 98.2% when using a bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network trained with a multitemporal dataset and a derived bare soil spectral index (BSI). This indicates that the methodology is highly effective in distinguishing abandoned crops from active ones. Additionally, the study highlights that Sentinel-2 features are well suited for land use identification, including abandoned lands. Therefore, the use of remote sensing data and machine learning techniques in this methodology offers a more accurate and efficient approach compared to traditional methods for detecting abandoned crops."
