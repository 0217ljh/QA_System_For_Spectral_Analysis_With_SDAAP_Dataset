        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the predictive model is the relative RMSE (RRMSE). The RRMSE can go up to 1 if the model is unable to capture more specific information than the simple average of each target parameter value, and it would approach 0 in the case of ideal model performance."

        "Output": "The hybrid approach (HA) in the novel methodology contributes to the noninvasive analysis of the structure and composition of human skin in vivo by improving both the accuracy and robustness of the inverse analysis, while significantly reducing the computation times. The HA combines the speed of the predictive model (PM) based on machine learning with the versatility of the iterative optimization using the numerical forward model (inverse Monte Carlo - IMC) approach. This combination allows for a more efficient and effective analysis of the skin's contents of chromophores, scattering properties, and thicknesses of the epidermis and dermis. By utilizing the strengths of both the PM and IMC procedures, the HA provides a comprehensive and reliable assessment of the skin's structure and composition in a timely manner."

        "Output": "The hybrid approach (HA) in the novel methodology contributes to the noninvasive analysis of the structure and composition of human skin in vivo by combining the speed of the predictive model (PM) with the versatility of the inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) procedure. This means that the HA improves both the accuracy and robustness of the inverse analysis while significantly reducing computation times.\n\nThe HA outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and computation times. The performance of the predictive model (PM) in the HA is shown to be very satisfying, both in objective testing using cross-validation and in direct comparisons with the IMC procedure. This indicates that the PM in the HA provides accurate results in analyzing the contents of skin chromophores, scattering properties, and thicknesses of the epidermis and dermis.\n\nAdditionally, the HA significantly reduces computation times compared to the IMC procedure. The iterative optimization of 14 skin model parameters using the IMC procedure is computationally expensive."
