        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, laboratory hyperspectral imaging with machine learning approaches can be considered superior to traditional soil sampling campaigns in accurately predicting the distribution of organic carbon (OC) in undisturbed soil cores. The study used laboratory hyperspectral imaging with a variety of machine learning approaches, specifically a bias-corrected random forest, to successfully reproduce the OC distribution in the soil cores with very good to excellent model goodness-of-fit. This enabled the researchers to map the spatial distribution of OC in the soil cores at a very high resolution (approximately 53 x 53 \u6e2dm). The high resolution of the images allowed for statistically powerful analysis of the spatial distribution of OC, even in the subsoil where OC content is more heterogeneous and lower in content. Additionally, the imaging technique revealed distinct regions of OC enrichment and depletion, including biopores with significantly higher SOC contents than the surrounding soil matrix. This fine-scale investigation of the vertical distribution of soil OC and hotspots of OC storage would not have been possible with traditional soil sampling campaigns. Therefore, laboratory hyperspectral imaging with machine learning approaches offers a superior method for accurately predicting the distribution of OC in undisturbed soil cores compared to traditional soil sampling campaigns."
