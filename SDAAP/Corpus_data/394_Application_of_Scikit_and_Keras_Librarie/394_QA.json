        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification performance in the research on iron ore classification using LIBS combined with machine learning was accuracy. The accuracy values for the three models were reported as 82.96%, 93.33%, and 94.07% respectively. The accuracy metric measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. In this case, it indicates how well the models were able to classify the iron ore samples based on their LIBS spectra. The accuracy values achieved in this research indicate a high level of classification performance."
