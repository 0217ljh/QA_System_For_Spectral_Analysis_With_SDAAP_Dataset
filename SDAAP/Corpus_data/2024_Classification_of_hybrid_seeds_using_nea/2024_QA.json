        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, three different discriminant analysis models were established using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology combined with deep learning. The models used were partial least squares discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). These models were trained and tested using hyperspectral images in the range of 975-1648 nm of a total of 6136 hybrid okra seeds and 4128 hybrid loofah seeds, which both contained six varieties. The performances of these models were compared among the different hybrid seed varieties. The results showed that the discriminant analysis model based on the DCNN was the most stable and had the highest classification accuracy, exceeding 95%. This model was able to reduce the labor burden and time required in cross breeding-based progeny selection, thus accelerating the progress of related research."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology combined with deep learning can be considered superior to traditional methods in classifying hybrid seeds for the purpose of accelerating the selection process in cross breeding-based progeny selection. The study mentioned in the text applied this technology and compared its performance with other methods such as partial least squares discriminant analysis and support vector machine. The discriminant analysis model based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was found to be the most stable and had the highest classification accuracy, exceeding 95%. This technology offers advantages such as reducing labor burden and time required in the selection process, which can significantly speed up the progress of related research."
