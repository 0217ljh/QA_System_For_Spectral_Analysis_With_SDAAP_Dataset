        "Output": "Yes, visible and near-infrared spectroscopy combined with deep learning can be considered a superior method for estimating leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) in cotton leaves compared to traditional methods. The past study explored the feasibility of using this approach and obtained satisfactory results. Models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved high classification accuracy and low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for both qualitative and quantitative estimation of LNC. These results indicate that deep learning and spectroscopy have great potential for effectively detecting the nitrogen content of cotton leaves, making it a promising method for real-world application."
