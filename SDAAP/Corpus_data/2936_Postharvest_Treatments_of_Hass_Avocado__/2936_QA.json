        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral imaging coupled with machine learning techniques can be considered superior to traditional methods in estimating avocados' quality indicators and assessing the performance of chitosan coatings on avocados' quality and shelf life. The study evaluated the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate avocados' quality indicators. The results showed that Bayesian regularization neural networks (BRNNs), a type of ML technique, outperformed other tested ML techniques in estimating quality attributes from HSI features. This suggests that HSI coupled with ML can provide a real-time nondestructive assessment of avocados' quality. Therefore, this approach can be considered superior to traditional methods, which may involve destructive sampling or subjective sensory evaluations."
