These metrics provide a quantitative measure of how well the models are able to predict the actual soil salinity values. \n\nThe determination coefficient R-2 measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (soil salinity) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral and texture features). A higher R-2 value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n\nRMSE and MAE, on the other hand, measure the average difference between the predicted and actual soil salinity values. A lower RMSE and MAE indicate a higher accuracy of the model in predicting the soil salinity."

        "Output": "The combination of texture information and spectral index improves the accuracy of the soil salinity inversion model in this study. The study found that the model using the vegetation index (VIs) was more accurate than the model using the salinity index (SIs) and the model using both the salinity index and vegetation index (SIs + VIs). Additionally, when texture information was combined with the vegetation index, the inversion accuracy further improved. The model using both the vegetation index and texture index (VIs + TIs) had the best inversion effect."
