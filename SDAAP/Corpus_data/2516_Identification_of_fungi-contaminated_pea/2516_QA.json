        "Output": "Yes, the JSRC method proposed in the related study can be used to improve the identification accuracy of fungi-contaminated peanuts using hyperspectral imaging. The experimental results showed that the JSRC method outperformed the support vector machine (SVM) classifier in terms of robustness against random noise and considering pixels at the edge of the peanut kernel. The classification accuracy of JSRC reached 99.2% and 98.8% at the pixel scale, and at least 98.4% and 96.8% at the kernel scale for two peanut varieties. This indicates that the JSRC method can provide more accurate and consistent results than the SVM classifier, and correctly mark fungi-contaminated peanuts in both learning and test images."
