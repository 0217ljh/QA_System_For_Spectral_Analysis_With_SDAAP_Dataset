        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to determine Atterberg limits in soil samples from diverse locations to estimate Atterberg limits is the root mean squared error (RMSE). The RMSE values obtained for the vis-NIRS models were 7% for liquid limit (LL), 5% for plastic limit (PL), and 7% for plasticity index (PI). This indicates that the vis-NIRS models can estimate LL, PL, and PI with an accuracy of approximately 7% or less."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the findings of the relatedstudy, visible near-infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for estimating Atterberg limits in soil samples with diverse geographical and mineralogical characteristics. The related study tested the feasibility of using vis-NIRS as an alternative to conventional measurements of Atterberg limits and found that it provided fast and accurate results. The performance of vis-NIRS models was compared with existing pedotransfer functions (PTF), and the vis-NIRS models, particularly those using Support Vector Machines (SVM), yielded marginally better predictive ability. The SVM models estimated Atterberg limits with low root mean squared error (RMSE) values. Additionally, the SVM model correctly classified a higher number of samples in terms of the sample swelling class compared to the best PTF. These results indicate the great potential of vis-NIRS for reliable estimates of Atterberg limits in soil samples with diverse geographical and mineralogical characteristics."
