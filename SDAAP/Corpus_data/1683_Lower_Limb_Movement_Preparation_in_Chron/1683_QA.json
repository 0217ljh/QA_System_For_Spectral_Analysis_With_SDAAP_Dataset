        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study was the total hemoglobin (totHB) signal changes in the premotor cortex and/or posterior parietal cortex. This metric was used to classify the hemodynamic signals underlying lower limb motor preparation in stroke patients. The results of the study indicated that linear discriminant analysis classification of totHB signal changes showed above chance accuracy in discriminating paretic from nonparetic movement preparation trials in most of the tested patients. Therefore, this metric was able to successfully classify the hemodynamic signals associated with lower limb motor preparation in stroke patients."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the results of this proof of concept study, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was able to reliably measure and classify hemodynamic signals underlying lower limb motor preparation in stroke patients. The study found that specific hemodynamic changes associated with left and right hip movement preparation could be measured with fNIRS. Additionally, linear discriminant analysis classification of the total hemoglobin (totHB) signal changes in the premotor cortex and/or posterior parietal cortex showed above chance accuracy in discriminating paretic from nonparetic movement preparation trials in most of the tested patients. Therefore, the study provides evidence that fNIRS can detect brain activity associated with single-trial lower limb motor preparation in stroke patients."
