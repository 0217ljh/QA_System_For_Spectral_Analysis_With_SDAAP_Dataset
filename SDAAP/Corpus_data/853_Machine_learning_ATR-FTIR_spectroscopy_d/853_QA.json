        "Output": "The researchers utilized machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of ATR-FTIR-based screening for ancient biomolecules in faunal remains from archaeological sites by using random forest-based machine learning. They applied ATR-FTIR to examine three sets of archaeological bone assemblages and analyzed them using ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) for taxonomic identification. By using machine learning models, they were able to improve the accuracy of ATR-FTIR-based screening for ancient mtDNA analysis and ZooMS by 20-40%. This approach potentially allows for a universal screening system that can be applied across multiple sites and is largely independent of the spectrometers used."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of machine learning in ATR-FTIR-based screening can be considered a superior method compared to traditional screening approaches for the analysis of ancient biomolecules in faunal remains from archaeological sites. The related study states that the new approach using random forest-based machine learning vastly improves upon FTIR-based screening methods prior to ZooMS and ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis. The machine learning models were able to improve the accuracy of ATR-FTIR-based screening for ZooMS by 20-40%. This suggests that machine learning can enhance the predictive accuracy of screening methods and make them more efficient and reliable compared to traditional approaches."
