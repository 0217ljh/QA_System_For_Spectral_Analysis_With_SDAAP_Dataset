However, it does state that the models yield >95% classification accuracy when trained on spectroscopic data with different Raman shift spacings. Therefore, it can be inferred that the metric used to evaluate the classification accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified instances.\n\nAs for how far this metric can go in assessing the performance, it provides a general measure of the models' accuracy in classifying microplastic structures. However, it does not provide information on other performance aspects such as precision, recall, or F1 score, which could give a more comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance. Additionally, the text does not mention any information about the size or diversity of the dataset used for training and testing the models, which could also impact the reliability and generalizability of the classification accuracy metric."

This database allowed for the easy creation of classification models using open-source random-forest, K-nearest neighbors, and multi-layer perceptron algorithms. These models achieved a classification accuracy of over 95% when trained on spectroscopic data with varying Raman shift spacings. \n\nFurthermore, these models were able to maintain accuracy even in non-ideal conditions, such as with spectroscopic sampling rates of 1 kHz and when microplastic particles were located outside the focal plane of the laser. This adaptability and robustness of the classification models enabled them to be used with different spectrometer setups and experimental requirements. Overall, the machine-learning classification models provided a solution to the limitations of Raman spectroscopy in analyzing microplastics structures by offering a flexible and accurate analytical approach."
