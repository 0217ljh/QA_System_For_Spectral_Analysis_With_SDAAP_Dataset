        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in the related study was the prediction accuracy. The results showed that the prediction accuracies of the 1D-CNN, PLS-DA, and PSO-SVM models based on full spectra were 97.12%, 97.12%, and 95.68% respectively. These accuracies indicate that the models performed well in determining the geographical origin of Chinese chestnuts. Additionally, the Kappa coefficient value was higher for the 1D-CNN model compared to the SPA-PLS-DA model, suggesting that the 1D-CNN model had a better overall agreement with the actual geographical origin of the chestnuts."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers used two different methods to determine the optimal wavelengths for various machine learning methods in their study. The first method they used was competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), and the second method was a successive projections algorithm (SPA). These methods were individually utilized for wavelength selection. By applying these methods, the researchers were able to identify the wavelengths that provided the most relevant and discriminative information for determining the geographical origin of Chinese chestnuts."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The prediction accuracies of the 1D-CNN, PLS-DA, and PSO-SVM models based on full spectra were 97.12%, 97.12%, and 95.68%, respectively. When simplified models using SPA-PLS-DA and 1D-CNN were used, the prediction accuracies generally improved. The prediction accuracies of SPA-PLS-DA and 1D-CNN models both reached 97.12%, which is the same as the full spectra models. However, the 1D-CNN model presented a higher Kappa coefficient value than the SPA-PLS-DA model. This suggests that the simplified models using SPA-PLS-DA and 1D-CNN have comparable or even better performance in determining the geographical origin of Chinese chestnuts using HSI."
