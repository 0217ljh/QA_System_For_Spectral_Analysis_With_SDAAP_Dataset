        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the models in past study is the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The RMSEP provides a measure of the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the dataset. The RMSEP values for the infrared spectroscopy (IR) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) partial least squares (PLS) models were 1.88% and 6.55% respectively. This indicates that, on average, the predicted values from the models have an error of 1.88% and 6.55% compared to the actual values."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The feasibility of quantifying phosphogypsum in soil using portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) combined with multivariate calibration is comparable to traditional methods. The past study found that the predictive determination coefficient and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of the NIR and IR partial least squares (PLS) models were 0.9933 and 1.88% and 0.8830 and 6.55%, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) for the models were 4.0006% and 14.225%. The reproducibility of the models was satisfactory with good accuracy and precision. Additionally, the results of a dual t test demonstrated that there was no significant difference between these methods and the standard procedure (GB/T 23456-2018) at the 95% confidence level. However, the portable NIR and IR methods have the advantages of on-site analysis, speed, and convenience for the determination of phosphogypsum in soil."
