        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the characterization accuracy of the models in the related study was the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, it was used to assess the correlation between the predicted terahertz properties (refractive index and extinction coefficient) and the actual terahertz properties of the thermal barrier coatings.\n\nThe related study found that the characterization accuracy of the PCA-SVM model reached over 95% based on the correlation coefficient comparisons. This indicates a strong linear relationship between the predicted and actual terahertz properties, suggesting that the model is effective in characterizing the microstructural features of thermal barrier coatings using terahertz spectroscopy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning algorithms were utilized in the characterization of microstructural features of thermal barrier coatings using terahertz spectroscopy by employing a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system configured in transmission mode. The system estimated terahertz properties of porous YSZ ceramic coatings, including refractive index, extinction coefficient, and relative time-domain broadening ratio. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to reduce the dimensions of the refractive index and extinction coefficient spectra data. This ensured that different terahertz properties could be treated as inputs with similar weights during modeling. Three models, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), back-propagation (BP) neural network, and support vector machine (SVM), were set up to conduct regression analysis. The top one principal component of refractive index spectra data and the top two principal components of extinction coefficient spectra data were selected as the model inputs based on the contribution rates of eigenvectors. The correlation coefficient comparisons showed that the characterization accuracy of PCA-SVM reached over 95% and outperformed the other models. Therefore, machine learning algorithms, specifically PCA-SVM, were utilized to accurately characterize the microstructural features of thermal barrier coatings using terahertz spectroscopy."

The related study demonstrates that the combination of terahertz nondestructive technology and machine learning techniques can be used to characterize the microstructural features of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) in gas turbine blades. The related study used terahertz spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms to analyze the microstructures of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) atmospheric-plasma-sprayed (APS) thermal barrier coatings. The terahertz properties of the coatings, such as refractive index, extinction coefficient, and relative time-domain broadening ratio, were estimated using a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to reduce the dimensions of the terahertz properties data, and three models (multiple linear regression, back-propagation neural network, and support vector machine) were set up for regression analysis. The results showed that the PCA-SVM model had a characterization accuracy of over 95% and outperformed the other models. Therefore, the related study concludes that the combination of terahertz nondestructive technology and machine learning techniques is efficient and feasible for characterizing the microstructural features of TBCs in gas turbine blades."
