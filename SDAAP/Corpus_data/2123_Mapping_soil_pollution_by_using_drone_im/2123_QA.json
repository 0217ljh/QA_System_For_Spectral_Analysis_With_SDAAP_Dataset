        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction performance of the machine learning algorithms in mapping soil contamination was the accuracy. The accuracy metric measures the proportion of correctly predicted risk levels (low, medium, high) compared to the actual risk levels. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that while accuracy is a commonly used metric, it may not provide a complete assessment of the model's performance, especially in imbalanced datasets where one class dominates the others. In such cases, accuracy alone may not accurately reflect the model's ability to predict the minority class (high-risk points in this study). \n\nTo assess the accuracy more comprehensively, additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also considered. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance in correctly identifying high-risk points and balancing the trade-off between precision (the ability to correctly identify high-risk points) and recall (the ability to capture all high-risk points)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The results of comparing the performance of the machine learning algorithms to traditional Kriging interpolation in predicting arsenic risk levels in the contaminated area showed that the extreme random forest (ERF) algorithm performed best overall. The ERF algorithm had a higher prediction performance compared to traditional Kriging interpolation. In test area 1, the accuracy of ERF was 0.87, which was higher than the accuracy of random forest (0.81), multi-layer perceptron (0.78), and support vector machine (0.77). Additionally, the F1-score of ERF for discerning high-risk points in test area 1 was 0.8. Therefore, the machine learning algorithms, particularly ERF, outperformed traditional Kriging interpolation in predicting arsenic risk levels in the contaminated area."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the extreme random forest (ERF) algorithm in predicting As risk levels using high-resolution aerial imaging (HRAI) combined with machine learning is generally better than that of traditional Kriging interpolation. According to the study, the accuracy of ERF in test area 1 reached 0.87, which is higher than the accuracy of traditional Kriging interpolation. Additionally, the F1-score of ERF for discerning high-risk points in test area 1 was as high as 0.8. This suggests that ERF outperforms Kriging interpolation in predicting high-risk areas for soil contamination."
