        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of Landsat 8 OLI data, particularly the vegetation indices (VIs) based on shortwave infrared bands, has shown to be effective for crop classification in Hokkaido, Japan. Traditional methods for crop classification typically rely on manual field surveys or aerial photography, which can be time-consuming and costly. \n\nIn contrast, remote-sensing techniques using Landsat 8 OLI data provide a more efficient and cost-effective approach. The VIs calculated from Landsat 8 OLI data offer frequent revisits, adequate spatial and spectral resolution, and some data is available free of charge. \n\nThe study evaluated various VIs, including those based on combinations of reflectance wavebands and the six components of the Kauth-Thomas transform. The VIs based on shortwave infrared bands (bands 6 or 7) were found to improve classification accuracy.\n\nBy utilizing a combination of all derived data from Landsat 8 OLI, the overall accuracy of crop classification in Hokkaido, Japan was reported to be 94.5%."
