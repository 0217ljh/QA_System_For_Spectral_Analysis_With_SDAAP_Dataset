        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the classifier to distinguish between brain cancer and noncancer tissues was sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of the classifier was reported to be 93%, indicating that it correctly identified 93% of the high-grade glioma (brain cancer) tissues. The specificity of the classifier was reported to be 95%, indicating that it correctly identified 95% of the normal white matter (noncancer) tissues."

        "Output": "Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) shows promise as a superior method for distinguishing between brain cancer and noncancer tissues during surgery. The past study achieved a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 95% for discriminating high-grade glioma from normal white matter using DRS. These results suggest that DRS has the potential to be a more accurate and reliable technique compared to traditional methods for intraoperative cancer detection in the brain."
