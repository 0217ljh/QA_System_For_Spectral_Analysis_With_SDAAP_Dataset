        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fusion of pansharp QuickBird multispectral and Eagle MNF hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR-derived measures resulted in higher classification accuracies compared to traditional methods for habitat mapping in south Cumbria, North West England. The best classification accuracies achieved were 89.8% and 92.6% using the Support Vector Machine and Random Forest machine learning algorithms, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of combining high-resolution multispectral or hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data for accurate habitat mapping."
