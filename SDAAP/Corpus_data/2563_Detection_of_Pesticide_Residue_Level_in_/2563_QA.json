For visible/near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectra:\n   - The best model was ResNet, with an accuracy of over 93%.\n   - LR, SVM, RF, and CNN also showed closed and fine results.\n\n2. For near-infrared (NIR) spectra:\n   - LR was the best model, with an accuracy of over 97%.\n   - SVM, CNN, and ResNet also showed closed and fine results.\n\nOverall, the results of NIR spectra performed better than those of Vis-NIR spectra.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the study demonstrated that the combination of hyperspectral imaging technology and machine learning models can effectively detect pesticide residues in grapes. The study used visible/near-infrared (Vis-NIR) and near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging systems to detect the level of pesticide residues in three different varieties of grapes. Logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and residual neural network (ResNet) models were used to build classification models for pesticide residue levels. The results showed that the accuracy of the models varied depending on the spectra used. For Vis-NIR spectra, the ResNet model performed the best with an accuracy of over 93%. For NIR spectra, the LR model performed the best with an accuracy of over 97%, but SVM, CNN, and ResNet also showed good results. The study concluded that deep learning models, such as CNN and ResNet, performed better than conventional machine learning models. Therefore, the combination of hyperspectral imaging technology and machine learning models can effectively detect pesticide residues in grapes."
