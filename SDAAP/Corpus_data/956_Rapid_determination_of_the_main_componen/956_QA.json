        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the feasibility of using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coupled with chemometrics to detect the moisture, oil, protein, and starch content in corn by constructing a backward interval partial least squares (BiPLS)-principal component analysis (PCA)-extreme learning machine (ELM) quantitative analysis model. They used BiPLS to select characteristic spectral intervals and determined the best principal components using the prediction residual error sum of squares of Monte Carlo cross validation. They also utilized a genetic simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the parameters of the ELM regression model. The established regression models for moisture, oil, protein, and starch showed high accuracy and robustness, with prediction determination coefficients, prediction root mean square errors, and residual prediction deviations provided for each component."

        "Output": "Yes, the established regression models using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coupled with chemometrics can be considered as a superior alternative to traditional methods for rapid detection of multiple components in corn. The related study states that the NIRS rapid detection model has higher robustness and accuracy, and it can meet the demand for corn component detection with high prediction determination coefficients and low prediction root mean square errors. Additionally, the model utilizes characteristic spectral intervals, spectral data dimensionality reduction, and nonlinear modeling, which further enhance its effectiveness in detecting multiple components in corn rapidly."
