Optimal characteristic bands: The study identified optimal characteristic bands from the full spectrum using both statistical and physical perspectives. The specific bands were not mentioned in the provided text.\n\n2. Retrieval models: The study tested both linear and nonlinear models for retrieving soil arsenic content. The linear models tested were Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The nonlinear machine learning models tested were Back Propagation Neural Network (BP), Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR).\n\nAmong these models, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) consistently outperformed all others when using both original and optimal characteristic bands. The Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, which considers spatial non-stationarity and heterogeneity, also outperformed traditional models such as BP and SVR.\n\nTherefore, the best-performing retrieval models for soil arsenic concentrations in Pingtan Island were the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model and the improved Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model."

        "Output": "The study determined the optimal characteristic bands and retrieval models for the hyperspectral retrieval of soil arsenic concentrations in Pingtan Island, China through a series of experiments and analyses. \n\nFirst, the researchers tested three linear models (Multiple Linear Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression, and Geographically Weighted Regression) and three nonlinear machine learning models (Back Propagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine Regression, and Random Forest Regression). These models were chosen based on their ability to analyze the relationship between spectral variables and soil arsenic concentration.\n\nNext, ground-based soil full spectrum data from Pingtan Island was used to retrieve soil arsenic content. The researchers compared the performance of the different models in accurately predicting the soil arsenic concentrations.\n\nThe results showed that the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model consistently outperformed all other models, both when using the original full spectrum and when using optimal characteristic bands. This suggests that there is a complex, nonlinear relationship between soil arsenic concentration and spectral variables, influenced by various landscape factors.\n\nAdditionally, the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, which considers spatial non-stationarity and heterogeneity, outperformed traditional models such as Back Propagation Neural Network and Support Vector Machine Regression. This highlights the importance of incorporating spatial characteristics in"
