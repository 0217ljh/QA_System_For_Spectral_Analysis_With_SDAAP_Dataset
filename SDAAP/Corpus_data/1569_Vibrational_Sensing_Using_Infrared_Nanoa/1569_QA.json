        "Output": "Yes, SEIRA spectroscopy can be considered a superior method for the reliable optical detection of glucose and fructose in aqueous solutions compared to traditional methods. The text states that SEIRA spectroscopy allows for the detection of pure glucose and fructose solutions, as well as mixtures of both, in aqueous solution. It also mentions that the method utilizes a reflection flow cell geometry with physiologically relevant concentrations as small as 10 g/L. Additionally, the use of principal component analysis (PCA) as a machine learning algorithm improves the baseline correction and extraction of vibrational data. These advancements in SEIRA spectroscopy make it a promising technique for biosensing applications and suggest that it can provide higher sensitivities and quantitative analysis, even in tear drops."
