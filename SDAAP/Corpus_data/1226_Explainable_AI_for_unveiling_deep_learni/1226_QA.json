        "input": "",
        "Output": "The explainable framework in the re;ated study extracts knowledge on the important features used by the deep learning model for pollen classification by analyzing the data modalities of scattering, spectrum, and lifetime. The framework utilizes these three data modalities to train deep learning-based models with millions of parameters to distinguish different pollen classes. \n\nTo extract knowledge on the important features, the framework employs explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methodology. This methodology allows for a deeper understanding of the black-box model decisions by providing additional methods to analyze and interpret the model's predictions. \n\nThe extracted knowledge on the important features is then examined from the perspective of domain knowledge. This involves comparing the identified features to available reference data on pollen sizes, shape, and laboratory spectrofluorometer measurements. By comparing the model's identified features with known characteristics of pollen, researchers can gain insights into which features are most relevant for accurate pollen classification."
