        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers determined if the inclusion of weekly time-series data and derived indicators improved the accuracy of mapping exotic annual grass cover by comparing their results to distribution models that used other remote sensing products as primary inputs. Specifically, they compared their framework, which utilized weekly Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data and derived metrics, to models that used Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products or monthly, seasonal, or annual HLS composites. By comparing the accuracy and performance of these different models, the researchers were able to assess the effectiveness of incorporating weekly time-series data and derived indicators in mapping exotic annual grass cover."
