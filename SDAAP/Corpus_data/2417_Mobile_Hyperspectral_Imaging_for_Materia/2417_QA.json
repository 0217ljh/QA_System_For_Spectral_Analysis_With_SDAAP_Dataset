        "Output": "The researchers validated the performance of the mobile hyperspectral imaging system in recognizing different surface objects, including crack detection, through experimental validation. They developed a machine learning methodology with classification models that involved four different feature extraction processes. By using hyperspectral pixels in conjunction with dimensionality reduction, they were able to achieve outstanding potential in recognizing eight different surface objects, including crack detection, with an F1 score of 0.962. The performance of the hyperspectral imaging system was compared to gray-valued images with a higher spatial resolution, and it was found that the hyperspectral imaging system outperformed the gray-valued images. This experimental validation demonstrated the potential of computational hyperspectral imaging for automating damage inspection in structural materials, particularly in complex scenes found in built objects in service."

The experimental validation showed that the hyperspectral imaging system, when combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithms, demonstrated outstanding potential for recognizing different surface objects, including detecting cracks with a high F1 score of 0.962. This suggests that the system has the capability to effectively detect damage amid other complex objects on material surfaces. Therefore, it can be envisioned that computational hyperspectral imaging can be utilized to automate the inspection of structural materials, particularly in scenarios involving complex scenes in built objects in service."
