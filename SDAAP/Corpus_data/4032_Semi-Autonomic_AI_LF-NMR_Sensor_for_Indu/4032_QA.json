        "Output": "The metric chosen to classify the T-2 relaxation curves was the oxidation level of the oils. The T-2 relaxation curves were classified into three ordinal classes representing three different oil oxidation levels: non-oxidized, partial oxidation, and high level of oxidation. The accuracy of the classification using this metric was reported to be high, with a classification accuracy of 95%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, the convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using supervised learning. The T-2 relaxation curves were paired with ground-truth labels of oxidation values obtained from conventional chemical lab oxidation tests. The CNN was trained to classify the T-2 relaxation curves into three ordinal classes representing three different oil oxidation levels: non-oxidized, partial oxidation, and high level of oxidation. The training data was used to teach the CNN to recognize patterns and features in the T-2 relaxation curves that correspond to different oxidation levels."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed AI method, which integrates a large training set, an LF-NMR sensor, and a machine learning program, can be used as a real-time, non-destructive, rapid, robust, and low-cost sensor for evaluating the oxidation status of oils during industrial production. The study developed a H-1 LF-NMR relaxation sensor application that can classify oil oxidation levels based on T-2 relaxation curves. The test data results showed a high classification accuracy of 95%, indicating that the proposed AI method meets the requirements of the oil and food industry for monitoring oil's purity and nutritional value during production, transportation, storage, and cooking."
