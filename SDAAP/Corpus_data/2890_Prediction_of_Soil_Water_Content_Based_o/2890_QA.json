        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the research findings, the CARS-Rfrog-BPANN method can be considered reliable for predicting soil water content (SWC). The study showed that this method achieved the best results for both SWC levels (above and below field capacity) compared to other models such as extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM). The BPANN model using the CARS-Rfrog method had a high accuracy in retrieving SWC, with R(2)p values of 0.941 for sub-\u80c3(f) samples and 0.764 for super-\u80c3(f) samples. The RMSEp values were also low, indicating a small prediction error. Therefore, based on these results, the CARS-Rfrog-BPANN method can be considered reliable for predicting SWC in real-time and nondestructive monitoring using hyperspectral reflectance."
