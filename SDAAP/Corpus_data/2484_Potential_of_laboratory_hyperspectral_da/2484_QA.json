        "Output": "In the study, the laboratory hyperspectral data was used to train the in-field detection model for potato late blight disease. A hyperspectral training library was created using six detached leaf trays, which contained a total of 8585 spectra. These spectra were labeled into a healthy class and five progressive stages of disease development. The data was then smoothed and normalized. \n\nThe researchers trained a logistic regression model on 70.0% of this data, while reserving 30.0% for validation. This model was trained using the laboratory hyperspectral data to learn the spectral signatures associated with different stages of disease development. \n\nAfter the model was trained, twelve hyperspectral images were taken in field conditions. These images were classified using the trained model to determine the presence and severity of late blight disease. The classification accuracy of the laboratory data was found to be 94.1%, but this was not sufficient to detect field symptoms using the infield collected dataset. \n\nTo improve the model's performance in field conditions, the researchers made changes to the spectra pre-processing. They included the first derivation and adopted a new normalization strategy. This resulted in a new model with a lower classification accuracy of 80.8% when validated on labeled laboratory spectra."

Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the use of laboratory hyperspectral data to train an in-field detection model for potato late blight disease is considered superior to traditional methods in the related research. The study showed that by training a logistic regression model on laboratory hyperspectral data, a classification accuracy of 94.1% was achieved."
