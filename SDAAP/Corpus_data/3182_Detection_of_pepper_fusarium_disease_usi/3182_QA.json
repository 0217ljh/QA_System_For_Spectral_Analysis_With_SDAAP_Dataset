These algorithms were Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-nearest Neighbor (KNN).\n\nThe detection process involved two stages. In the first stage, a feature vector was obtained. This feature vector consisted of the coefficients of wavelet decomposition and the statistical values of these coefficients. These coefficients were derived from the light reflections obtained from the pepper leaves using a spectroradiometer.\n\nIn the second stage, the feature vectors of the input data were classified using the three classification algorithms. The algorithms were trained to differentiate between healthy and fusarium diseased peppers based on the feature vectors. The classification algorithms used in the related study were ANN, NB, and KNN.\n\nThe study reported the average success rates of the different classification algorithms for the first two groups (diseased and healthy peppers). For the detection of the health case of pepper, the average success rates were calculated as 100% for KNN, 97.5% for ANN, and 90% for NB.\n\nSimilarly, the success rates for the classification of all groups (healthy, fusarium-diseased, mycorrhizal fungus, fus"

        "Output": "The related study's findings on the effectiveness of using light reflections and classification algorithms in detecting pepper diseases contribute to the understanding of the superiority of spectroscopic methods over traditional methods in disease detection by demonstrating the high accuracy rates achieved through this approach. \n\nThe use of spectroradiometer to capture light reflections from plant leaves provides valuable information about plant health, allowing for early detection of diseases. By analyzing the reflections obtained from healthy and diseased pepper leaves, the study shows that it is possible to differentiate between healthy and fusarium-diseased peppers.\n\nFurthermore, the study employs classification algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) to classify the feature vectors obtained from the reflections. The high success rates achieved by these algorithms, particularly KNN with 100% accuracy in detecting the health case of pepper, highlight the effectiveness of using classification algorithms in disease detection.\n\nComparing the results of the spectroscopic method with traditional methods, the study demonstrates that the spectroscopic approach outperforms traditional methods in disease detection. The accuracy rates achieved by the spectroscopic method, such as 100% for KNN in detecting diseased and healthy peppers, surpass the rates achieved by traditional methods.\n\nOverall, the study's findings emphasize the"
