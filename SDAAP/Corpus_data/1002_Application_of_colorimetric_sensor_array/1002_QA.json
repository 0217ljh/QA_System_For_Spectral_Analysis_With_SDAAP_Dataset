        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, according to the information provided in the related study, visible-near-infrared spectroscopy is considered a superior method compared to image processing for the non-destructive detection of grain freshness using a colorimetric sensor array (CSA) and machine-learning-based models. The related study states that visible-near-infrared spectroscopy could better separate grains with different freshness compared to image processing, as observed from the results of principal component analysis. Additionally, the prediction set of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models, which were based on visible-near-infrared spectroscopy, correctly identified 100% of rice, 96.88% of paddy, and 97.9% of soybeans. This indicates that visible-near-infrared spectroscopy is more effective in detecting grain freshness compared to image processing."
