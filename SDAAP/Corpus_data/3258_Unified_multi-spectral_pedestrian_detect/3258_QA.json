        "Output": "The proposed sensor fusion framework utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to detect pedestrians in challenging real-world environments using multi-spectral sensors by designing a three-branch detection model. Each branch of the CNN takes different modalities as inputs, such as color and thermal sensors. Unlike existing methods, the framework considers all detection probabilities from each modality in a unified CNN framework and selectively uses them through a channel weighting fusion (CWF) layer to maximize the detection performance. Additionally, an accumulated probability fusion (APF) layer is introduced to combine probabilities from different modalities at the proposal-level. By formulating these sub-networks into a unified network, the entire network can be trained in an end-to-end manner. This approach allows for improved pedestrian detection in challenging real-world environments by leveraging the complementary information provided by multi-spectral sensors."
