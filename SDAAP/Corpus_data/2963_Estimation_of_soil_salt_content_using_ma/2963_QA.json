        "Output": "The study utilized particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM) to estimate the accuracy of the spatial distribution of salinized soil in the Lake Ebinur area by using index parameters derived from fractional derivative transformation of hyperspectral imagery. The PSO-SVM model was trained using the calculated parameters, such as the difference index (DI), normalized difference index (NDI), ratio index (RI), and salt index (SI), which were obtained from the HJ-1/HSI data. The model was optimized using the particle swarm optimization algorithm to find the best parameters for accurate estimation of the spatial distribution of salinized soil. The results showed that the optimal model based on the DI transformation under the fractional derivative of 1.2-order had a good prediction effect, with R-2, RMSE, and RPD values of 0.66, 13.81 g/kg, and 2.59, respectively. This indicates that the PSO-SVM model successfully estimated the accuracy of the spatial distribution of salinized soil in the Lake Ebinur area."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of fractional derivatives in processing hyperspectral images can be considered superior to traditional methods in predicting the spatial distribution of soil salinization in the Lake Ebinur area. The study demonstrates that the application of fractional derivatives in the processing of hyperspectral images can highlight the spectral details of the images and enrich their pretreatment methods. This technique allows for the mapping of the spatial distribution of the degree of soil salinization, which is of practical importance for the prevention and control of soil salinization in arid and semi-arid regions. The results of the study also show that the model based on different fractional derivatives and exponential transformations had a good prediction effect, indicating the potential of spectral index optimization and prediction models in monitoring soil salinization."
