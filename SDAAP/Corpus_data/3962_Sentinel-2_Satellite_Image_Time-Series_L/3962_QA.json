        "Output": "The proposed approach using copulas and matrix factorization is shown to achieve higher classification yield compared to traditional methods, such as Neural Networks, in terms of improving the accuracy of land cover classification for Satellite Image Time-Series (SITS) data. The experiments conducted on Sentinel-2 SITS data at a study site on Reunion Island demonstrated that the use of copulas, in combination with matrix factorization, outperformed several commonly used approaches for SITS-based land cover mapping. The specific copulas used in the approach were able to effectively model the dependencies between spectral and temporal features of the satellite images, leading to improved classification accuracy."
