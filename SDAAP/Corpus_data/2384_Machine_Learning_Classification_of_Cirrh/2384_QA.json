        "Output": "The metric chosen to determine the discriminative ReHo-map for minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) in cirrhotic patients was the support vector machine (SVM) method. The SVM-classifier was applied using leave-one-out cross-validation.\n\nIn terms of accuracy and sensitivity, the optimized discriminative model using the SVM approach and brain intrinsic activity measurement achieved a total accuracy of 82.9% and a sensitivity of 81.3%. This indicates that the SVM method was able to accurately identify and classify patients with MHE based on their resting-state fMRI data."
