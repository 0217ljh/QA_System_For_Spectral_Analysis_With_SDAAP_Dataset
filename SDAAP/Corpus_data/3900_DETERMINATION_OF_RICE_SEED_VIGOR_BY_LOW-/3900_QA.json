        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study was rice seed vigor, which was determined based on three parameters: germination energy, germination percentage, and germination index. These parameters were calculated using physiological index data of the rice seed samples. \n\nThe study aimed to establish discriminative models using different algorithms to determine the vigor of rice seeds based on low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) spectral data. The results showed that models constructed using Fisher's linear discriminant algorithm gave the best results in distinguishing between seeds with high and low vigor.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of rice seed vigor, along with the discriminative models constructed using Fisher's linear discriminant algorithm, can accurately determine the vigor of rice seeds. The study suggests that this method provides a rapid, accurate, and non-destructive approach to test rice seed vigor."

The study showed that these models, particularly the one constructed using Fisher's linear discriminant algorithm, provided rapid, accurate, and non-destructive results.
