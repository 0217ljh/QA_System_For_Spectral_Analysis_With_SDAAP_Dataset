        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of hyperspectral images in the non-destructive method for characterizing a plant's physiological status is more accurate and efficient compared to traditional methods. Conventional methods, such as biochemical extraction or leaf clipping, are destructive and time-consuming, limiting the throughput capability. In contrast, hyperspectral imaging allows for fast and non-invasive measurements of a plant's physiological traits.\n\nThe non-destructive method presented in the related study utilizes supervised data-driven Machine Learning Regression (MLR) algorithms to generate prediction models for four targeted physiological traits. The input variables for building the regression model are reflectance spectra transformed using Standard Normal Variate (SNV). This approach provides a more accurate estimation of the plant's physiological status.\n\nValidation results in the related study show that the non-linear prediction models, developed based on the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm, produced the best estimation accuracy for all plant traits. This indicates that the use of hyperspectral images and MLR algorithms can provide highly accurate predictions of a plant's physiological traits.\n\nFurthermore, the non-destructive method allows for efficient monitoring of plant physiological status. The hyperspectral imaging sensor enables fast data acquisition, eliminating the need for time-consuming sample preparation and analysis."
