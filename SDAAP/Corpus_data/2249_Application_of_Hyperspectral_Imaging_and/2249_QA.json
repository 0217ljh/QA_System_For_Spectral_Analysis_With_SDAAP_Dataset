        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the model's generalization capacity is the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The RMSEP values for sugar content were 1.118 degrees Brix for test sets using different varieties and 1.085 degrees Brix for a different vintage. For pH, the RMSEP values were 0.199 for test sets using different varieties and 0.183 for a different vintage. These values indicate a very good performance in terms of the model's generalization capacity."

The text states that the model's generalization ability showed a very good performance, improving and updating the current state of the art. Additionally, the model's robustness is highlighted, taking into account the differences in terroir, climatic variations, and grape varieties. Therefore, the use of machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks in combination with hyperspectral imaging is considered a viable and advanced approach for nondestructive assessment of wine grape ripeness."
