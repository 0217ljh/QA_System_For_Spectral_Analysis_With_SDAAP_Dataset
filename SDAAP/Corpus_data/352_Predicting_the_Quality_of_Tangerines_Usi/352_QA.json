        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance for the prediction of important parameters of tangerines is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV). The network performed well, achieving accurate predictions for the five important parameters of tangerines: soluble solid content (SSC), total acidity (TA), acid-sugar ratio (A/S), firmness, and Vitamin C (VC). The R-2 values for SSC, TA, A/S, firmness, and VC were 0.9885, 0.8075, 0.9014, 0.9472, and 0.7386, respectively. The RMSECV values for SSC, TA, A/S, firmness, and VC were 0.1430 \u63b3Brix, 0.0868%, 1.9984, 0.0294 kg, and 29.4104 mg/100 g, respectively."

        "Output": "Yes, the GCNN-LSTM-AT network can be considered as a superior spectroscopic method compared to traditional methods for predicting tangerine parameters using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. The results of the past study showed that the GCNN-LSTM-AT network outperformed three traditional machine-learning algorithms (MWPLS, RF, and SVR) and two deep neural networks (DeepSpectra2D and CNN-AT) in accurately predicting the five important parameters of tangerines (soluble solid content, total acidity, acid-sugar ratio, firmness, and Vitamin C). The network achieved high accuracy and low root mean square error cross-validation values for all the parameters, indicating its effectiveness and stability in fruit quality assessment."
