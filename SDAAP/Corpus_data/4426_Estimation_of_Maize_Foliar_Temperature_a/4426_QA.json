They collected UAV imagery data using very high-resolution cameras during different growth stages of the maize crop. They then used the collected data along with the random forest machine-learning algorithm to analyze and predict the maize foliar temperature and stomatal conductance. The researchers compared the results with known growth stages and observed patterns of water stress to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the method. The study demonstrated that the combination of UAV imagery and machine learning can provide valuable information for smallholder farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation schedules and crop management."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of thermal infrared waveband and vegetation indices derived from red-edge and near-infrared can be considered superior to traditional methods in estimating maize foliar temperature and stomatal conductance as indicators of crop water stress and moisture content over the entire phenological cycle. The study evaluated the utility of optical and thermal infrared UAV imagery, along with a random forest machine-learning algorithm, to estimate these parameters. The results showed that the thermal infrared waveband was the most influential variable during vegetative growth stages, while the red-edge and near-infrared derived vegetation indices were fundamental during the reproductive growth stages for both temperature and stomatal conductance. The random forest model was able to accurately estimate these parameters at different phenological stages. Therefore, the combination of UAV imagery and machine learning provides a useful tool for smallholder farmers to make informed management decisions, including optimizing irrigation schedules."
