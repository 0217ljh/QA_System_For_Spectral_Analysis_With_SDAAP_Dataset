        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral soil BD model can be considered superior to traditional pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) for soil assessment and carbon stock assessments in Irish soil. The past study found that the spectral soil BD model had a lower root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.132 g/cm3 compared to the RMSEP of 0.196 g/cm3 for traditional PTFs. Additionally, the spectral soil BD model showed considerable performance improvements on different types of horizon and no significant accuracy difference between shallow and deep topsoil. These findings suggest that the spectral soil BD model has higher accuracy and homogeneity of performance on different depth layers, making it a noteworthy strength for carrying out national soil surveys and large-scale carbon stock assessments."
