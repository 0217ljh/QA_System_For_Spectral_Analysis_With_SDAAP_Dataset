        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed stack-based ensemble learning approach addresses the challenges of higher dimensionality, Hughes phenomenon, spatial resolution of image data, and presence of mixed pixels in multi-spectral image classification by optimizing the classification performance.\n\nFirstly, the higher dimensionality challenge is tackled by using a stack-based ensemble learning approach. This approach combines multiple base classifiers to create a strong classifier that can handle the complex and high-dimensional nature of multi-spectral image data. By leveraging the diversity of the base classifiers, the ensemble learning approach can effectively capture the different aspects of the data and improve the classification accuracy.\n\nSecondly, the Hughes phenomenon, which refers to the loss of classification accuracy due to the increase in the number of spectral bands, is addressed by integrating the proposed ensemble learning with the XGBoost method. XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can handle high-dimensional data and mitigate the Hughes phenomenon. By combining the ensemble learning approach with XGBoost, the classification accuracy is further improved, overcoming the limitations of classical machine learning algorithms.\n\nThirdly, the spatial resolution of image data is taken into account in the proposed approach. The ensemble learning method considers the spatial context of the image by incorporating information from neighboring pixels. This helps in capturing the spatial patterns and improving the accuracy of land cover and land"
