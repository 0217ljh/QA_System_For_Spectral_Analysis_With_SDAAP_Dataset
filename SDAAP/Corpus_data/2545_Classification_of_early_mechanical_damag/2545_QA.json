        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral imaging technology and advanced modeling techniques such as transfer learning and convolutional neural networks can be used to detect early mechanical damage of pears more accurately compared to traditional methods. The study used a visible/near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system to obtain images of intact and damaged pears. These images were then preprocessed and feature-extracted. The ConvNeXt network, pre-trained on ImageNet, was fine-tuned and used for classification. The results showed high accuracy in detecting both compression damage and collision damage, with the T_ConvNeXt model achieving even higher accuracy than the fine-tuned ConvNeXt model. This demonstrates the effectiveness of hyperspectral imaging and advanced modeling techniques in accurately detecting and classifying mechanical damage in pears."
