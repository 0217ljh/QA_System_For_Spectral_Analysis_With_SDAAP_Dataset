        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the Coffee-Leaf-Miner Index in detecting coffee leaf miner infestation is compared to traditional methods in the related study. According to the information provided, the Coffee-Leaf-Miner Index presented the best performance among the evaluated vegetation indices, with a coefficient of determination of about 0.87, a root mean square error of 4.92% coffee leaf miner infestation, accuracy of 89.47%, and kappa coefficient of 95.39. \n\nIn contrast, the R-2 range of other spectral indices used in the study was from 0.017 to 0.867, and the root mean square error ranged from 4.996 to 13.582% coffee leaf miner infestation. This suggests that the Coffee-Leaf-Miner Index outperformed the other traditional spectral indices in terms of accuracy and precision in detecting coffee leaf miner infestation.\n\nAdditionally, machine learning algorithms, specifically the supervised Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, were used to recognize patterns of coffee leaf miner infestation in the field. The Coffee-Leaf-Miner Index was the only index used for the identification test, and both algorithms achieved performance above 80% for user and producer precision."
