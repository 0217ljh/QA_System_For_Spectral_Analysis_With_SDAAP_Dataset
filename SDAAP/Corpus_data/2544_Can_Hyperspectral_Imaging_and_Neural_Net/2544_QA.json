        "input": "",
        "Output": "The hyperspectral cameras and LiDAR were combined in the prototype scanning system by mounting them on a pan-tilt head for discriminating ore from waste at the point of excavation. This allowed for the simultaneous capture of hyperspectral data and three-dimensional LiDAR data. The positioning system determined the spatial location of the resultant hyperspectral data cube, ensuring accurate alignment between the two types of data."

        "instruction": "Can hyperspectral imaging be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for discriminating ore from waste at the point of excavation, based on the findings of the related study?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "Based on the findings for discriminating ore from waste at the point of excavation, hyperspectral imaging can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for discriminating ore from waste at the point of excavation. The study developed a prototype scanning system that combined hyperspectral cameras and a three-dimensional LiDAR, which was able to accurately classify ore and waste on the scanned face with good accuracy when compared to the mine geological model. This suggests that an excavator-mounted hyperspectral system could be used to guide a human or autonomous excavator operator to selectively dig ore and minimize dilution."
