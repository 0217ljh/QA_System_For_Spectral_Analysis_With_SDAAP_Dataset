        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study in estimating aboveground carbon stocks in mangrove forests is the vegetation indices NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). These indices were generated using a covariance matrix based band selection algorithm. The study found that the correlation between the carbon measured in the field sampling and the carbon estimated by NDVI and EVI was satisfactory, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 84.1% for NDVI and 86.98% for EVI. Therefore, these vegetation indices can be used as a metric to estimate aboveground carbon stocks in mangrove forests with a reasonable level of accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study assessed carbon stocks in mangrove forests using machine learning models by applying the NDVI and EVI vegetation indices generated from hyperspectral images. The study used five different machine learning models (Linear, Polynomial, Logarithmic, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Sigmoidal Function) to estimate carbon stocks based on the field measurements and the vegetation indices. The results showed that all five models provided satisfactory estimates of carbon stocks, with the RBF model showing the best results compared to the other models."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral sensor in estimating aboveground carbon stocks in mangrove forests compared to traditional methods by using field measurements of biomass and carbon acquired simultaneously with the satellite data. The study also used the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier to identify the spatial distribution of the most dominant mangrove species using spectral profiles extracted from the hyperspectral data. The results showed that SAM performed well, accurately identifying the total area covered by each major species. Additionally, the study applied the NDVI and EVI vegetation indices, generated using a covariance matrix-based band selection algorithm, to assess the carbon stocks of the various species using machine learning models. The results showed a satisfactory correlation between the carbon measured in the field sampling and the carbon estimated by the NDVI and EVI indices, with the RBF model showing the best results among the tested models. Overall, the study findings confirm that hyperspectral images from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor can be effectively used to perform species-wise mangrove analysis and accurately assess aboveground carbon stocks."
