        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized in the accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) in arid areas using hyperspectral image data obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle platform by applying various preprocessing techniques to the original hyperspectral data. The preprocessing techniques included first derivative, second derivative, absorbance, first derivative of absorbance (FDA), and second derivative of absorbance. \n\nThree machine learning models, namely random forest (RF), gradient boosted regression tree (GERT), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), were used to select the importance of feature variables. The results showed that the pretreatment effect of FDA was the best. \n\nBased on these results, a model was established using geographical weighted regression (GWR). The model based on FDA-GERT was found to be optimal for accurate estimation of SMC. The determination coefficient (R-2) of the modeling set and the verification set were 0.890 and 0.891, respectively, and the quartile interval reached 3.490. \n\nCompared to RF and XGBoost algorithms, the GERT algorithm demonstrated more prominent advantages. The R-2 of most of the model modeling set and the verification set were greater than 0.600."

The results of the study showed that the pretreatment effect of FDA was the best among the different preprocessing methods applied to the hyperspectral data. Additionally, the model based on FDA-GERT (gradient boosted regression tree) was found to be optimal, with high determination coefficients (R-2) for both the modeling set and the verification set. This indicates that the FDA pretreatment method, in combination with the GERT algorithm, is effective in predictive modeling of SMC and can provide theoretical support for the management and protection of agro ecosystems in arid regions."
