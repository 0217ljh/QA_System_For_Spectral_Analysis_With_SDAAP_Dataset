        "Output": "The test samples were represented using sparse coding in the spare representation classification method by finding the sparsest linear combinations of the data dictionary. The data dictionary was created using all the training samples, and the test samples were represented as a linear combination of the dictionary atoms. The sparse coding technique was used to find the coefficients that result in the sparsest representation of the test samples."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The spare representation classification method using near-infrared spectroscopy and a deep learning algorithm is reported to have higher classification accuracy compared to traditional methods for discriminating classes of tobacco leaves. The effectiveness of the spare representation classification method was compared with K-nearest neighbor and particle swarm optimization-support vector machine algorithms, and the results showed that the proposed method had higher classification accuracy. Additionally, the spare representation classification method was also found to be more efficient. Therefore, the study suggests that near-infrared spectroscopy with the spare representation classification algorithm may be an alternative method to traditional methods for discriminating classes of tobacco leaves."
