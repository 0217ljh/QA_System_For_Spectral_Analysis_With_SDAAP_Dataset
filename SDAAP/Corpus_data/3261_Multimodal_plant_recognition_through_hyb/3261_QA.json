The study mentions that the recognition result for leaf spectral data was 98.03% GAR, and for leaf venation features it was 93.51% GAR. Therefore, the GAR metric can go up to 98.03% and 93.51% for leaf spectral data and leaf venation features, respectively."

        "Output": "The use of feature fusion technique in the multimodal plant classification system using leaf venation patterns and spectral signatures performs better than the use of non-imaging spectral signatures features alone in terms of accuracy of plant identification. The recognition result for the feature fusion technique is 98.03% GAR, while the recognition result for non-imaging spectral signatures features alone is 93.51% GAR. This indicates that the feature fusion technique improves the accuracy of plant identification in comparison to using non-imaging spectral signatures features alone."
