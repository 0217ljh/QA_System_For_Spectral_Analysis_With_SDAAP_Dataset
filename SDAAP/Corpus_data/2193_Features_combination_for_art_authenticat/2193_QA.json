        "Output": "The metric chosen to quantify the authenticity of the paintings in the tool for authentication studies is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it does mention that the tool provides a quantitative indicator for authenticity. This suggests that the tool likely uses a specific metric or algorithm to calculate this indicator. Unfortunately, the text does not provide further details on the specific metric used or how far it can go in the tool for authentication studies."

        "instruction": "How does the developed tool using spectroscopic methods compare to traditional methods in supporting authentication studies of Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso's paintings?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The developed tool using spectroscopic methods provides a quantitative indicator for authenticity and a mapping image that indicates areas where materials not coherent with Amadeo's palette were detected. This tool offers a more objective and scientific approach compared to traditional methods of authentication studies, which may rely on subjective visual analysis or historical documentation. By combining brushstroke analysis with information on pigments and comparing them to a database of paint tubes used by the artist, the tool provides a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of the paintings' authenticity. The method has been tested in twelve paintings and has shown promising results, indicating its effectiveness in supporting authentication studies of Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso's paintings."
