        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method is the overall accuracy. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified land cover categories compared to the total number of land cover categories. In this case, the highest overall accuracy achieved was 89.51%.\n\nThe overall accuracy metric provides a measure of the overall performance of the proposed method in accurately mapping changes in land cover categories."
