        "Output": "The text does not explicitly mention the specific metric that was chosen to evaluate the performance of the retrieval models. However, it does mention that the retrieval framework integrates six statistical indicators of model performance and the fitted slope of the regression line. These indicators are likely used to assess the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. \n\nAs for how far this metric can go, the text does not provide information on the limitations or extent of the metric. It only states that the retrieval framework can produce more robust and accurate predictions compared to those relying solely on correlation coefficients."

        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly stated whether the DWT combined with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) coupled extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) retrieval model can be used to estimate the concentration of other heavy metals in agricultural soil using spaceborne hyperspectral imagery. The study specifically focuses on the estimation of nickel (Ni) concentration in agricultural soil. Therefore, it is unclear whether the same retrieval model can be applied to estimate the concentration of other heavy metals. Further research or information would be needed to determine the applicability of the retrieval model to other heavy metals."
