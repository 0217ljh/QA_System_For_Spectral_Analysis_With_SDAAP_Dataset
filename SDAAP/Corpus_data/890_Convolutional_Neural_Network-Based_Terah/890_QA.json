        "input": "",
        "Output": "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for feature extraction and classification of liquid contraband spectra. The input to the CNN for THz spectrum classification is one dimension containing the entire spectrum, rather than certain THz peaks. The CNN automatically learns high-level features of the entire spectra through feature detectors, reducing the complexity of manual extraction. Pooling layers were used to reduce output complexity and prevent overfitting of the data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework addresses the challenges of complex components and spectral overlapping effect in the classification of liquid contraband using Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in the following ways:\n\n1. Complex Components: The framework is designed to handle liquid contraband with complex components. This means that it can effectively classify liquid contraband that contains multiple substances or compounds. The CNN is trained on a dataset that includes liquid contraband with complex components, allowing it to learn the patterns and features associated with different substances. This enables the framework to accurately classify liquid contraband with complex compositions.\n\n2. Spectral Overlapping Effect: The framework also addresses the issue of spectral overlapping effect in similar types of contraband. Spectral overlapping occurs when the THz spectra of different substances or compounds are similar, making it difficult to distinguish between them. The CNN is trained on a dataset that includes liquid contraband with similar spectra, allowing it to learn the subtle differences and patterns that can be used to differentiate between them. This enables the framework to effectively classify liquid contraband with overlapping spectra."

The related study states that the algorithm achieves the best performance compared to other deep learning and machine learning algorithms. This suggests that the CNN algorithm is more effective in accurately classifying liquid contraband compared to traditional methods."
