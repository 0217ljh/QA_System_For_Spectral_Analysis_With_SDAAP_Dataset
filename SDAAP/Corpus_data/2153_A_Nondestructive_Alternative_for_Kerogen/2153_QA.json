        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the method is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it is stated that the models generated achieved an accuracy above 0.8 in the validation step and 0.75 in the test step. Therefore, it can be inferred that the accuracy metric used in this study is likely to be a classification accuracy metric, such as accuracy score or classification error rate.\n\nIn terms of classification accuracy for kerogen type, the results obtained in this study indicate that the method has a high potential for accurate classification. The models generated achieved an accuracy above 0.8 in the validation step and 0.75 in the test step. This suggests that the method is able to establish a strong relationship between selected spectral features and the kerogen type of the source rocks sampled. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact upper limit of the classification accuracy for kerogen type using this method."
