        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the weed-mapping accuracy in the study was the overall accuracy (OA) and Marco-F1. The study found that the fusion of textural, structural, and thermal features achieved the best performance in weed mapping, with an OA of 96.4% and Marco-F1 of 0.964. This indicates that the chosen metric can go up to 96.4% accuracy in weed mapping."

The study found that the fusion of textural, structural, and thermal features achieved the best performance in weed mapping, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.4% and Marco-F1 of 0.964. This indicates that the inclusion of canopy temperature (CT) measurements, along with spectral, textural, and structural measurements, improved the accuracy of weed mapping."
