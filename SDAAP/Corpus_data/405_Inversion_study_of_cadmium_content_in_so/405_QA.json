        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the FOD transformation and TBIs can be considered as superior spectral feature processing methods compared to traditional methods in the past study on the rapid and accurate inversion of cadmium (Cd) element content in saline-alkali land using visible-NIR spectroscopy and machine learning models. The FOD transformation helps eliminate baseline drift and reduce spectral noise, improving the quality of the reflection spectra. The constructed TBIs effectively enhance the correlation with Cd content compared to using single bands alone, reducing redundant information and enhancing the spectral features. These methods contribute to more accurate and reliable predictions of Cd content in saline-alkali land."
