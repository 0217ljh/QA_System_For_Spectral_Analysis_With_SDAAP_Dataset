        "Output": "In the related study, three machine learning models were used: random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). These models were used as base classifiers in a stacking ensemble model, with logistic regression (LR) as the meta-classifier."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the ralated study, it is not explicitly stated whether the 1H NMR-based metabolomics technology and machine learning model used in the related study can be applied to predict PMI in other animal species or human skeletal muscles. The study specifically mentions the use of Sprague-Dawley rats and their skeletal muscle tissues to explore the changes of small molecular compounds at different PMIs. Therefore, further research would be required to determine the applicability of this technology and model to other animal species or human skeletal muscles."
