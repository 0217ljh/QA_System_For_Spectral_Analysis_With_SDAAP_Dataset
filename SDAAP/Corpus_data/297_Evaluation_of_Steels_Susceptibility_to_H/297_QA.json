This ANN model is trained using hydrogen thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) analysis data and recent advances in machine learning techniques. The model is able to predict the hydrogen-induced degradation of mechanical properties of steels based on the TDS data. By utilizing machine learning, the model can learn and identify patterns and correlations between the TDS data and the mechanical properties of steel, allowing for accurate predictions of the degradation of steel properties caused by hydrogen. This approach provides a valuable engineering tool for steel characterization and quantitative prediction of hydrogen-induced degradation."

        "Output": "It can be inferred that the developed prototype software application based on thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) analysis coupled with artificial neural networks (ANN) is considered a superior method for quantitatively evaluating the susceptibility of steels and alloys to hydrogen embrittlement compared to traditional methods. This is because the approach combines TDS analysis, which provides data on the thermal desorption of hydrogen from the material, with recent advances in machine learning technology to develop a regression ANN model. The model predicts the hydrogen-induced degradation of mechanical properties of steels, indicating a strong correlation between the TDS data and the mechanical properties. Additionally, the use of a data augmentation procedure improves the generalization of the model. The prototype software application based on this approach is described as a valuable engineering tool for steel characterization and quantitative prediction of the degradation of steel properties caused by hydrogen."
