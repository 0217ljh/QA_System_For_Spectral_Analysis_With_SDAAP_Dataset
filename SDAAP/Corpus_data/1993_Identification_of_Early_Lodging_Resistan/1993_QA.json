        "Output": "The effects of different feature extraction methods and modeling methods on the identification of maize lodging resistance using hyperspectral imaging data and machine learning methods were evaluated in the study. \n\nThe study compared the effects of principal component analysis (PCA) and successive projections algorithm (SPA) as feature extraction methods. It was found that the PCA method had the most significant dimensionality reduction effect on the spectral features at various planting densities. This suggests that PCA was effective in reducing the complexity of the hyperspectral data and extracting relevant information for identifying lodging resistance.\n\nThe SPA algorithm, on the other hand, was used to select the characteristic wavelength distribution. The study found that the characteristic wavelength distribution selected by the SPA algorithm was relatively uniform and had obvious lodging resistance classification characteristics. This indicates that the SPA algorithm was able to identify specific wavelengths that were indicative of lodging resistance in maize.\n\nIn terms of modeling methods, a support vector machines (SVM) model with a Gaussian kernel function was established. The model underwent parameter training and optimization to improve its performance. The study found that the model established by the SPA-SVM method had the best training effect and prediction results."
