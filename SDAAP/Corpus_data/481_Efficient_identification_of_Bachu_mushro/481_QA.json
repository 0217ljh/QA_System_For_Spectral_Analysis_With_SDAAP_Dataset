        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy of the proposed method is the percentage of correct classifications. The past study reports the classification accuracy in terms of percentages for different groups and data types (cap and stem) of the Bachu mushroom mixed with other mushrooms. The reported percentages range from 77.81% to 100% for different combinations of mushroom groups and data types. Therefore, the metric of classification accuracy can go up to 100% in the past study."

The combination of FT-IR spectroscopy and statistical algorithms can be considered a superior method for the classification of Bachu mushroom samples compared to traditional methods. The past study demonstrates that this approach achieved high classification accuracies for different parts of the Bachu mushroom samples when compared to other mushroom samples. This indicates that FT-IR spectroscopy combined with statistical algorithms provides an accurate and efficient way to classify Bachu mushroom samples, offering a potential improvement over traditional methods."
