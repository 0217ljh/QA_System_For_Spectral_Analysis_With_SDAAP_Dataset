        "Output": "The authors determined the best regression model for estimating water quality parameters in optically complex aquatic environments using the Automatic Model Selection Algorithm (AMSA). AMSA automatically chooses between regression models and determines the number and combination of features to use in order to obtain the best model. In the related study, the authors used four Machine Learning (ML) feature ranking methods and three ML regression models. They applied AMSA to a synthetic and two real matchup datasets to find the best models. Finally, they used two images from optically complex waters to illustrate the predictive power of the best models. The results of this analysis indicated that AMSA has a great potential to be used for operational purposes and can be a useful objective tool for finding the most suitable model for a given sensor, water quality parameter, and environment."

        "Output": "AMSA automatically chooses between regression models and determines the number and combination of features to use in order to obtain the best model for estimating water quality parameters in optically complex aquatic environments. This is in contrast to traditional methods, which may lead to erroneous estimates when global algorithms are applied to local regions due to regional variations in complex waters."
