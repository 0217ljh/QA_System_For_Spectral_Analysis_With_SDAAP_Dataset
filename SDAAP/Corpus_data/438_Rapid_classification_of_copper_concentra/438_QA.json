The researchers compared four pretrained CNN models and found that all of them achieved a high classification accuracy of over 92%, with the highest accuracy of 96.2% achieved by the VGG16 model. This indicates that the knowledge learned from machine vision by the pretrained CNN models can accelerate the training process and reduce the risk of overfitting. Therefore, the past study concludes that deep CNNs and transfer learning have great potential for improving the classification of copper concentrates using portable LIBS."
