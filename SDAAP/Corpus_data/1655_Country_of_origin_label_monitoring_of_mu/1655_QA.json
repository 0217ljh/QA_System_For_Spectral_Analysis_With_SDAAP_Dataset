        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the performance of the classification algorithms was not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, the text does mention that the mean sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision values were above 98% for both octopus species when using linear tools such as orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and logistic regression (LR). This indicates that the results were highly accurate and precise in recognizing the geographic origin of the octopus species."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of portable NIR spectroscopy and machine learning was highly effective in determining the geographic origin of two octopus species in the related study. The results showed that linear tools such as orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and logistic regression (LR) were the most powerful and stable techniques, with mean sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision values above 98%. During the external validation phase, other techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron-artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) also performed well for specific octopus species. Overall, the outcomes suggest that this combination of analytical techniques has great potential for automated data recording, processing, and reporting, making it suitable for on-site and in-line monitoring of fishery products."
