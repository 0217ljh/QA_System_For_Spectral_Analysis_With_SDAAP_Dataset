        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized in the establishment of the reference ramanome database for rapid identification and metabolic profiling of microalgal cells by combining prequenching (pigment spectrum) and postquenching (whole spectrum) signals. The ensemble machine learning models were trained using single-cell Raman spectra (SCRS) from over 9000 cells of 27 phylogenetically diverse microalgal species, each under stationary and exponential states. These machine learning models were able to classify species and states with 97% accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of prequenching and postquenching signals can be considered a superior spectroscopic method for the rapid identification and metabolic profiling of microalgal cells. The establishment of the reference ramanome database demonstrated that this approach can classify microalgal species and states with 97% accuracy using ensemble machine learning. Additionally, it allows for the unveiling of the biosynthetic profile of Raman-sensitive metabolites at the single-cell level and the detection of their interconversion through intra-ramanome correlation analysis. This combined approach also enables the functional characterization and phylogenetic identification of not-yet-cultured cells from the environment. Overall, the use of prequenching and postquenching signals greatly accelerates the mining of microalgae and their products."
