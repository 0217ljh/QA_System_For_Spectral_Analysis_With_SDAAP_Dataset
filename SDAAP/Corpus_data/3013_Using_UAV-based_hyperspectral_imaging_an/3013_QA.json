        "Output": "The functional regression approach addresses the limitations of previous techniques in predicting in-season genetic variations for CMT, yield, and yield-related traits based on spectral data collected from UAVs by specifically addressing the challenges posed by small sample sizes and a large range of features collected per sample. Traditional methods of yield-prediction modeling become less robust in these cases. \n\nTo overcome these limitations, the functional regression approach was employed. This approach utilizes a function-on-function algorithm, which is chosen for its reliability in handling small datasets with high dimensionality. By using this algorithm, the functional regression model is able to accurately predict CMT, grain yield, and other traits in wheat under heat stress environmental conditions, even when data availability is constrained.\n\nThe results of the study indicate that the overall models for each trait studied showed good accuracy compared to the standard deviation of the data. The yield prediction model, in particular, demonstrated an average error of 13.42%, further supporting the reliability of the chosen functional regression approach for small datasets with high dimensionality."
