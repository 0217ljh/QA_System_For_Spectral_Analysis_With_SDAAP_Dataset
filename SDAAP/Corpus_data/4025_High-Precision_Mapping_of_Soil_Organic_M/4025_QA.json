The algorithm performed best in estimating SOM with a high R-squared value of 0.91, low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.95, small mean bias error (MBE) of 0.49, and a high relative prediction interval quality (RPIQ) value of 3.25. These performance metrics indicate the accuracy and reliability of the random forest algorithm in predicting SOM levels. Additionally, the study concluded that the SOM modeling and mapping results could meet the needs of farmers and provide a reference for UAVs to monitor SOM. Therefore, the random forest algorithm can be considered a superior method for mapping SOM in Northeast China using remote sensing and UAV imagery."
