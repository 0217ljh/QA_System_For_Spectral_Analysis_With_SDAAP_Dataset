        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of visible light-near infrared (VIS-NIR) with fractional order differential technology and machine learning algorithms can be considered a superior method for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) content in arid areas compared to traditional methods. The experimental results in the study show that the pretreatment effect obtained using a fractional order differential is better than that obtained using an integer order differential. The correlation at a specific band is significantly improved, and the maximum correlation is enhanced. The GBRT algorithm based on a 1.6-order spectral reflectance is specifically mentioned as superior to other models of different orders, with a verification concentration determination coefficient of 0.878 and a relative analysis error of 3.142. Therefore, the proposed scheme combining VIS-NIR, fractional order differential technology, and machine learning algorithms aims to improve the accuracy of estimating SOC content in arid areas."
