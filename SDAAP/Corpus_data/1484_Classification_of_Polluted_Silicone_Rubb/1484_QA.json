        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly stated whether the successful identification of elemental composition using LIBS analysis in this study can be applied to other types of pollutants or materials. The text specifically mentions the identification of pollutants such as copper sulphate, carbon-based compounds (fly ash, coal), and calcium-based compounds (cement and calcium phosphate). However, it does not mention whether LIBS analysis can be applied to different types of pollutants or materials beyond those mentioned. Therefore, it is unclear whether the same approach would be successful for other types of pollutants or materials."
