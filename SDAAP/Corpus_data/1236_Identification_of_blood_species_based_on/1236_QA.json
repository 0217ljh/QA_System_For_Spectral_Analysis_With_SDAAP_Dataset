        "Output": "The researchers compared the abilities of diffuse reflectance visible spectra and transmission near infrared spectra in classifying blood species by using these two spectra separately and jointly to build a classification model. They used the machine learning method artificial neural network as the algorithm for model building. They collected 1200 samples from five species to verify the recognition model. The results showed that the visible spectra outperformed the near infrared spectra, and the joint spectra of diffuse reflectance visible and transmission near infrared provided more information to distinguish the blood species more precisely."

They compared the abilities of the diffuse reflectance visible spectra and transmission near infrared spectra to classify the blood species. The machine learning method artificial neural network was used to build the classification model. \n\nThe researchers used 1200 samples from five species to verify the recognition model. The results showed that the visible spectra outperformed the near infrared spectra in classifying the blood species. However, the joint spectra of diffuse reflectance visible and transmission near infrared performed even better than the separate visible spectra. \n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that the joint spectra provided more information about the blood components, which allowed for a more precise distinction between blood species."
