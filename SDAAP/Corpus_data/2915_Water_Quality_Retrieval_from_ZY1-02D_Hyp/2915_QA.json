        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the accuracy and consistency of aquatic products retrieved from ZY1-02D and Sentinel-2 images is the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). This metric measures the amount of light reflected by the water surface and is used to estimate the concentration of non-optically active water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, permanganate index, and total phosphorus"
