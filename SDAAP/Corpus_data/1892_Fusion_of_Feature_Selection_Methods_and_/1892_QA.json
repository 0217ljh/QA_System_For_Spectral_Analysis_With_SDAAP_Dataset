        "Output": "Yes, the integration of PCA and MF methods for feature selection can be used in the research to improve the accuracy of the prediction model for estimating canopy water content (CWC) using hyperspectral imaging technology. The study found that the integration of PCA and MF methods provided a more robust feature selection for the proposed prediction model. This integration, along with the optimized BPNN model, significantly improved the accuracy of CWC forecasting. The results indicated that the selected features from PCA and MF methods, combined with the BPNN model, achieved an accuracy and correlation coefficient close to 1, with an RMSE of 0.252. Therefore, the integration of PCA and MF methods can effectively enhance the accuracy of the prediction model for estimating CWC using hyperspectral imaging technology."
