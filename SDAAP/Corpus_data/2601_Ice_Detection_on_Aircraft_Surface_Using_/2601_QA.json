        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the ice classification was overall accuracy (OA). The OA reached a maximum value of 88% for the original hypercubes classified with the random forest (RF) algorithm and 92% for the same hypercubes classified with the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm."
