        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of yield prediction in sugarcane genotypes was the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). This metric measures the average difference between the predicted yield and the actual yield as a percentage of the actual yield. \n\nThe study found that the MAPE was lower for predicting sucrose percentage (94% in plant crop and 93% in first ratoon crop) compared to predicting tons of cane per hectare (TCH) and tons of sugar per hectare (TSH). This suggests that the aerial imagery data collected through unmanned aerial vehicles can be more accurate in predicting sucrose percentage than overall yield-related components in sugarcane genotypes."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study evaluated the use of unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial imagery in predicting yield-related components in sugarcane genotypes during the final stage of the Florida sugarcane cultivar development program by collecting aerial imagery data using a hyperspectral sensor and ground data through manual sampling of sugarcane stalks at harvest. The researchers used the gradient-boosting regression tree model to analyze the data and determine the best timing for yield predictions. They compared the predicted yields from the aerial imagery with the actual measured yields to assess the accuracy of the predictions. The study found that yield was predicted with greater accuracy in July for the plant crop and in April for the first ratoon crop. Additionally, sucrose percentage was predicted with higher accuracy than tons of cane per hectare and tons of sugar per hectare. The results suggest that aerial imagery may be useful in making genotype selection in the early stages of the cultivar development program when actual yield estimation is not feasible."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial imagery can be considered superior to traditional methods in predicting yield-related components in sugarcane genotypes during the final stage of the Florida sugarcane cultivar development program. The study collected aerial imagery data using a hyperspectral sensor and ground data through manual sampling of sugarcane stalks. The results showed that the gradient-boosting regression tree model, based on the aerial imagery data, predicted yield with greater accuracy in July for the plant crop and in April for the first ratoon crop. Additionally, sucrose percentage was predicted with high accuracy in both crops. This suggests that aerial imagery can be a valuable tool for predicting yield-related components in sugarcane genotypes, especially in early stages when actual yield estimation is not feasible."
