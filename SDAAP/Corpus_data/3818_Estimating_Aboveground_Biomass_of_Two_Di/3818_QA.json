        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the algorithmic performances in predicting aboveground biomass (AGB) was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). \n\nThe accuracy of the predictions compared to field-based measurements varied depending on the forest reserve. For the Namhton forest reserve, the RF-based ordinary Kriging (RFOK) model had an R-2 value of 0.47 and an RMSE value of 0.52 AGB t/ha. For the Yinmar forest reserve, the RF-based co-Kriging (RFCK) model had an R-2 value of 0.91 and an RMSE value of 34.72 AGB t/ha. \n\nOverall, the predictions were relatively accurate, with the RF-based co-Kriging model performing better in terms of R-2 value and the RF-based ordinary Kriging model having a lower RMSE value."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of textural measures from wavelet analysis and vegetation indices (VIs) from Sentinel-2 showed strong predictive power in estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in the two forest reserves in Myanmar. These methods outperformed traditional methods in predicting AGB.\n\nThe study found that textural measures produced from wavelet analysis and VIs from Sentinel-2 were the strongest predictors for AGB in the evergreen forest reserve (Namhton). On the other hand, spectral bands and VIs showed the highest sensitivity in predicting AGB in the deciduous forest reserve (Yinmar).\n\nTo establish the predictive models, the study utilized random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithms to statistically link the spectral and topographic parameters derived from Sentinel-2 and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data with field-based AGB measurements. The RF and SGB algorithms were found to be effective in estimating AGB.\n\nFurthermore, the study employed RF-based Kriging models to improve the accuracy of AGB estimation. The fitted models were RF-based ordinary Kriging (RFOK) for Namhton forest reserve and RF-based co-Kriging (RFCK) for Yinmar forest reserve."
