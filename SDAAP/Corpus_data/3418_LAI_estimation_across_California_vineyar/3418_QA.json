        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the performance for leaf area index (LAI) estimation in commercial vineyards across California was the generated LAI, and it was assessed visually and statistically. The assessment showed that the RVM-RFFast model performed better than others. The metric can go as far as providing excellent estimation of net radiation (Rn) and latent heat flux (LE), good estimation of surface heat flux (G), and poor estimation of sensible heat flux (H)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, three machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), were considered for estimating leaf area index (LAI) in commercial vineyards across California. These ML algorithms were coupled with different feature-extraction approaches.\n\nTwo feature-extraction approaches were developed using high-resolution small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) information. The first approach, called the Full Approach, was a point-cloud-based feature-extraction approach. The second approach, called the Fast Approach, was a raster-based feature-extraction approach.\n\nThe Full Approach and the Fast Approach were developed based on multiple growing seasons from 2014 to 2019. These approaches aimed to extract and generate vine-scale information for LAI estimation.\n\nThe study compared the performance of the ML algorithms and feature-extraction approaches. The hybrid ML technique using RF and RVM, coupled with the Fast Approach and 9 input variables, was found to perform better than others in terms of visual and statistical assessments of the generated LAI. This model was referred to as the RVM-RFFast model."
