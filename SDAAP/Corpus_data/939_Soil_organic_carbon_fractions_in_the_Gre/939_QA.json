        "Output": "Principal Components Analysis was chosen as the metric to understand the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) into different fractions (particulate, mineral-associated, and pyrogenic) across the Great Plains ecoregion of the United States. This metric was able to capture much of the variance in the distribution of each fraction, allowing for the development of spatially continuous maps of these fractions."

        "Output": "Yes, the calibration transfer methodology using mid infrared (MIR) spectral library can be effectively applied to soil samples collected in the Great Plains ecoregion to understand the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions and explore the controls on their distribution. The related study developed a calibration transfer methodology to appropriately apply an existing MIR spectral library with analyte data on the distribution of SOC into particulate (POC), mineral-associated (MAOC), and pyrogenic (PyC) forms to nearly 8000 soil samples collected in the Great Plains ecoregion of the United States. This methodology allowed for the creation of a SOC fraction database, which was then used in combination with a machine learning-based predictive soil mapping approach to explore the controls on the distribution of fractions through soil profiles and across the region. The study found that the relative abundance of each fraction had unique depth distribution profiles, and clay content was identified as a strong control on the total amount and relative proportion of each fraction in both the surface and subsoil horizons. Therefore, the calibration transfer methodology using MIR spectral library was effective in understanding the distribution of SOC fractions and exploring the controls on their distribution in the Great Plains ecoregion."
