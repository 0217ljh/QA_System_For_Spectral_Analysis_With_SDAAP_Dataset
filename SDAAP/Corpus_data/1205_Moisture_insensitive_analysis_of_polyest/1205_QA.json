This interference from water contexts in the samples has been a major challenge in achieving accurate results. The EPO strategy is introduced to overcome this challenge and improve the reliability of modeling.\n\nThe EPO strategy is applied with various algorithms, including partial least squares regression (PLS), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme random tree (Extra-tree), decision tree model based on AdaBoost algorithm (AdaBoost-tree), support Vector machine (SVM), one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), and one-dimensional convolutional neural network with improved Inception structure (1D-Inception-CNN).\n\nBy implementing the EPO algorithm preprocessing, the accuracy of the NIR model is improved. The effectiveness of the EPO algorithm is verified by comparing the decision coefficients (R-2 score) and other indicators of the model without the EPO process and the model with the EPO process. The results show that the average decision coefficient (R-2 score) of the models is increased by 0.83 when the EPO strategy"
