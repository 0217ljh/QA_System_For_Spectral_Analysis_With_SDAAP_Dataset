It aims to find the optimal solution by iteratively updating the positions and velocities of particles in a search space. \n\nIn the past study, the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to improve the classification accuracy of the CNN-ELM networks. Specifically, a range of newly defined inertia weight and acceleration factor values were used in the particle swarm optimization algorithm. These values were optimized to enhance the performance of the CNN-ELM networks in classifying coal samples based on their spectral data.\n\nBy applying the particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the CNN-ELM networks, the researchers were able to improve the accuracy of the coal classification model. This optimization process helped to fine-tune the parameters of the CNN-ELM networks, making them more effective in extracting spectral characteristics and accurately classifying different types of coal."

The improved ELM classification model also has higher accuracy compared to the basic ELM and SVM classification models. This indicates that the proposed method can accurately identify the quality of coal.\n\nIn terms of speed, the traditional way of classifying coal using artificial classification and chemical analysis is time-consuming. However, the proposed method utilizes deep learning and ELM arithmetic to quickly extract spectral characteristics and construct a classification model. This significantly reduces the time required for coal classification.\n\nIn terms of economy, the traditional methods of coal classification entail high costs due to the need for artificial classification and chemical analysis. On the other hand, the proposed method combines deep learning, ELM arithmetic, and spectral data, which eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming processes. This makes the proposed method more economical compared to traditional methods.\n\nOverall, the proposed method of combining deep learning, ELM arithmetic, and visible and infrared spectra for coal classification offers improved accuracy, faster speed, and greater economy compared to traditional model."
