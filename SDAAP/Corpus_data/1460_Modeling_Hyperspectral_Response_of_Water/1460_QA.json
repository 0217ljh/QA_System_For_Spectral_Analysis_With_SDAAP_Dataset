However, the text does not provide any information about the specific machine learning algorithms that were compared to the ANN approach. Therefore, we cannot answer the question based on the given text."

        "Output": "Yes, the ANN approach applied to hyperspectral data can be used to detect early stages of water stress in lettuce plants with higher accuracy compared to traditional methods. The article states that the ANN approach was able to separate the water-stressed lettuce from the non-stressed group with up to 80% accuracy at the beginning of the experiment, and this accuracy improved to up to 93% at the end of the experiment. The study also found that absorbance data offered better accuracy than reflectance data for modeling water stress in lettuce plants. Therefore, the ANN approach using hyperspectral data shows promise for accurately detecting early stages of water stress in lettuce plants."
