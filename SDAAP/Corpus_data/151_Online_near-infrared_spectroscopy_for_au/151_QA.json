        "Output": "In the method, machine learning models were utilized to identify and classify polymeric materials in additive manufacturing using in situ near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. The process involved several steps:\n\n1. Data Collection: A low-cost NIR spectrophotometer was used to analyze 16 filaments with color and manufacturer variability. Each filament was probed three times in three distinct places, resulting in a total of 144 spectra.\n\n2. Chemometrics: Chemometrics techniques were applied to identify relevant peaks for functional groups in the spectra. This step helped in extracting important features from the data.\n\n3. Linear Regression: A linear regression model was used to filter out data that did not show relevant peaks. This step helped in removing noise and improving the quality of the data.\n\n4. Second-Derivative Savitzky-Golay: A second-derivative Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to aid in class separation. This filter helped in enhancing the differences between different classes of polymeric materials.\n\n5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This technique helped in capturing the most important information from the spectra while reducing the complexity of the data.\n\n6. LDA Algorithm: The resulting projections from PCA were then"
