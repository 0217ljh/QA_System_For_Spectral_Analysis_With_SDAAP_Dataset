The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the estimated leaf properties that can be explained by the spectral library. \n\nThe text states that the internal cross-validation showed satisfactory performance of the spectral library to estimate all nine leaf properties, with a mean R-2 value of 0.688. This indicates that, on average, the spectral library can explain approximately 68.8% of the variance in the estimated leaf properties.\n\nHowever, when the models calibrated solely using the spectral library were tested on external datasets (including soybean and camelina), the performance degraded significantly. The mean R-2 values for these external datasets were 0.159 for camelina and 0.337 for soybean. \n\nTo improve the model transferability and extend the utility of the spectral library, a small portion of external samples (n=20) was added to the library via extra-weighted spiking. This resulted in a significant improvement in the models' performance, with mean R-2 values of 0.574 for camelina and 0.536 for soybean. \n\nTherefore, while the spectral library initially showed satisfactory performance in"
