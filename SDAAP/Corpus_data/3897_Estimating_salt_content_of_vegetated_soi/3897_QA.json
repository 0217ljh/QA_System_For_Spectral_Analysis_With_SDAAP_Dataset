        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the model performance in the related study was the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (soil salt content) that can be explained by the independent variables (Sentinel-2 data). \n\nThe R-adj(2) value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data. In the related study, the R-adj(2) values for the four machine learning models ranged from 0.46 to 0.68, indicating a moderate to good fit of the models to the soil salt content data."

        "Output": "The purpose of building inversion models at different depths using machine learning algorithms in the study was to evaluate the sensitivity of Sentinel-2 to soil salt content (SSC) at different depths and to assess the capability of the models to accurately invert the SSC. By analyzing the performance of the models at different depths, the study aimed to determine the optimal depth for SSC inversion and identify the most effective machine learning algorithm for this task. This information can be valuable for accurately monitoring soil salinization in large vegetated areas."

The related study states that Sentinel-2 has demonstrated significant superiority in SSC inversion for its higher temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution. This indicates that Sentinel-2 is more effective in accurately and timely monitoring SSC at different depths compared to traditional methods."
