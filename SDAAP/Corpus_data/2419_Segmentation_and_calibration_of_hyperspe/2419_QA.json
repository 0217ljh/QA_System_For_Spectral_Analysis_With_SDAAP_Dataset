The paper states that these techniques have significant implications for improving the accuracy of honey analysis. The developed segmentation strategies, both manual and automatic, along with the selective average function, demonstrated reliable spectra extraction of honey samples. Additionally, the developed calibration technique using a dynamic reference followed by normalization successfully corrected distortions caused by variations in temperatures and lighting powers, as well as reduced the effect of spatial heterogeneity. These techniques ensure the repeatability of spectral information acquisition, which is crucial for further processing and the development of machine learning and statistically based prediction models. Overall, the paper suggests that these techniques have great potential to overcome the drawbacks of traditional chemically based assessment methods and improve the accuracy and consistency of hyperspectral imaging in honey analysis."
