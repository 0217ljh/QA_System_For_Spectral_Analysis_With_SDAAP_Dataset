This approach resulted in improved spectrum classification accuracy by 6% for the CNN-1D model, 2% for the Resnet-1D model, and 3% for the Inception-1D model. Additionally, the training time was reduced, and the curve smoothness increased. These findings suggest that transfer learning can enhance the feature extraction capability and, consequently, the accuracy of Raman spectroscopy models, expanding the potential applications of Raman-based detection for different substances."

        "Output": "The transfer learning approach enhances the feature extraction capability and accuracy of Raman spectroscopy models in the context of improving the accuracy and speed of pesticide detection by utilizing a pre-trained classification model and re-establishing the training model with self-tested pesticides.\n\nIn the transfer learning method described in the study, a classification model is first pre-trained using an open-source Raman spectroscopy database. This pre-training allows the model to learn general features and patterns present in Raman spectra. The feature extraction layer of the pre-trained model is then saved after training.\n\nNext, the training model for the Raman spectroscopy database is re-established using self-tested pesticides. However, the feature extraction layer remains unchanged. This means that the model benefits from the knowledge and feature extraction capabilities learned during the pre-training phase.\n\nBy leveraging the pre-trained model's feature extraction layer, the transfer learning approach improves the algorithm's ability to extract relevant features from Raman spectra. This enhanced feature extraction capability leads to improved accuracy in classifying the spectra of different substances, including pesticide residues.\n\nThe study evaluated three models, namely CNN-1D, Resnet-1D, and Inception-1D, with and without transfer learning. The results showed that the models with transfer learning achieved higher accuracy in spectrum classification compared to"
