        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the past study, supervised machine learning classifiers, specifically the support vector machine (SVM), were trained using the infrared spectra of the mosquitoes. The SVM was trained to predict the age of the mosquitoes based on the spectral data. Different preservation methods and storage durations were tested, and the mosquitoes were divided into groups accordingly. The trained SVM models were then used to classify the age of the mosquitoes based on the infrared spectra obtained from the preserved samples. The accuracy of the SVM models in predicting the age of the mosquitoes was evaluated based on the preservation method and storage duration."

        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the past study, it is not explicitly stated whether the findings of this study can be applied to other insect species. The past study specifically focused on the malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis and investigated the effects of different preservation methods and storage durations on the performance of mid-infrared spectroscopy for age-grading these mosquitoes. Therefore, it is unclear whether the same preservation methods and storage durations would have similar effects on other insect species. Further research would be needed to determine if these findings can be generalized to other insect species."
