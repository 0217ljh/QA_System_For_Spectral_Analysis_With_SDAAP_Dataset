        "Output": "The proposed solutions for improving the accuracy of specific spectra reconstructed using LBAC are compared to a classical physics-based approach in terms of effectiveness and suitability for different types of anomalous pixels and materials with known spectral reflectance.\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, the proposed solutions show promising results. The first solution, which combines LBAC with the empirical line method (ELM), is particularly effective for small and rare anomalous pixels with unknown reflectance. This solution leverages the strengths of both LBAC and ELM to accurately estimate the spectral reflectance of these pixels. The second solution, which involves introducing the spectra of interest in the training phase of LBAC, is effective for materials with a priori known spectral reflectance. By including these spectra in the training set, LBAC can better estimate their reflectance, leading to improved accuracy.\n\nIn comparison, the classical physics-based approach typically relies on estimating atmospheric parameters and then using these estimates to compensate for atmospheric effects in the hyperspectral data. This approach requires accurate estimation of the atmospheric parameters, which can be challenging and may introduce errors. Additionally, the classical approach may not be as suitable for specific types of anomalous pixels or materials with known spectral reflectance, as it does not directly address these cases."
