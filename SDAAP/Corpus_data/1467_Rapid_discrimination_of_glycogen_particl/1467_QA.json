The study mentioned in the text successfully applied this combination to predict the origins of glycogen particles from various organisms with high accuracy. The non-destructive, label-free, and low-cost features of SERS make it an attractive technique for rapid analysis. Additionally, the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with attention mechanism, further enhances the computational performance and accuracy of the analysis. This approach holds great potential for establishing quality control methodologies for glycogen-containing products."
