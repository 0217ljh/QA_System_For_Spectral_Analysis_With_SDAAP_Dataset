        "Output": "Yes, the deep learning-based framework using hyperspectral images can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for diagnosing membranous nephropathy. This is supported by the achieved overall accuracy of 95.04% in classifying idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) and hepatitis B virus-related membranous nephropathy (HBV-MN). The deep learning algorithm outperformed support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithms, indicating its potential as a new and more effective method for aiding in the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy."
