        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) shows promise as a method for monitoring vigilance levels in real-world scenarios and alerting individuals to low vigilance levels in dangerous workplaces. The text states that NIRS is a highly mobile technique that measures hemodynamics in the surface of the brain. It also mentions that non-invasive NIRS signals correlate with vigilance and carry enough information to decode subjects' reaction times at a single trial level. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the text does not directly compare NIRS to traditional methods for monitoring vigilance levels. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively conclude that NIRS is a superior method compared to traditional methods based solely on the information provided. Further research and comparison studies would be needed to make a more informed assessment."
