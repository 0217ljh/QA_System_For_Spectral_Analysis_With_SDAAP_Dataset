        "Output": "The metric chosen to develop a multi-layered mangrove mapping approach was the height histogram, which was used to stratify the overstory and understory based on local minima. This metric can go as far as separating the overstory and understory based on height thresholds, allowing for accurate species classification and mapping."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of spectral and LiDAR features to develop a multi-layered mangrove mapping approach that considers both overstory and understory detection and species classification provides improved accuracy and effectiveness compared to traditional methods for mapping multi-layered mangroves. Traditional methods often focus on the top canopy layer without considering the vertical structure of the mangroves. In contrast, this study utilizes LiDAR data to stratify the overstory and understory of the mangrove stands, providing valuable information about the vertical structure.\n\nBy combining spectral and LiDAR features, the study achieves satisfactory results in mapping seven vegetative species, with overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 0.84 to 0.88. This indicates that the integrated datasets offer a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the species distribution within the mangrove habitat.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlights that LiDAR data provides superior information for mapping the vertical structure of multi-layered mangroves. This information is particularly valuable for classifying single-layered and dual-layered species, such as Kandelia obovata with an understory beneath.\n\nOverall, the combination of spectral and LiDAR features in this study surpasses traditional methods by providing more accurate and detailed information about the vertical structure and species distribution of multi-layered mangroves."
