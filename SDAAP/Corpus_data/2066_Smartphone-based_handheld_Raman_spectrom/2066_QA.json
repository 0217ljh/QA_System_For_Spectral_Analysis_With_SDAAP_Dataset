These models were trained using spectra recorded from the smartphone-based miniaturized Raman spectrometer. The models showed excellent performance in discriminating pure essential oils from those adulterated with solvent, cheaper vegetable oil, or a lower price essential oil. Additionally, partial least squares regression analysis (PLS) was used to quantify the adulterants, including benzyl alcohol, vegetable oil, and lower price essential oil, based on the recorded spectra. The relative error of prediction (REP) for quantification ranged from 2.41% to 7.59%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of a smartphone-based miniaturized Raman spectrometer and machine learning techniques offers several advantages over traditional methods in terms of quickly identifying and differentiating adulterated essential oils.\n\nFirstly, the use of a smartphone-based miniaturized Raman spectrometer allows for portable and on-site analysis of essential oils. This eliminates the need for samples to be sent to a laboratory for testing, reducing the time required for analysis and providing real-time results.\n\nSecondly, machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest and partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), enable the rapid and accurate discrimination of pure essential oils from those that have been adulterated. These techniques can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be easily detectable by human analysis alone.\n\nFurthermore, the combination of the smartphone-based Raman spectrometer and machine learning allows for the identification of the specific type of adulteration present in the essential oil. In the case of ylang-ylang essential oil, the method was able to differentiate between adulteration with solvent, cheaper vegetable oil, and a lower-priced essential oil. This level of specificity is crucial for quality control and ensuring the authenticity of essential oil products.\n\nIn terms of speed, the method utilizing the smartphone-based Raman"
