        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the LAI estimation in chestnut trees was the coefficient of determination (R-2) value. The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variability in the LAI that can be explained by the biophysical and geometrical parameters used in the estimation. In the related study, the best achieved R-2 value was 85%, indicating that the chosen variables could explain 85% of the LAI variability in individual chestnut trees."

        "Output": "Machine-learning techniques were utilized in the estimation of LAI in chestnut trees by combining vegetation indices computed from different segments of the electromagnetic spectrum with geometrical parameters. These techniques involved robust algorithms that considered dimensionality reduction to avoid over-fitting and reduce bias and excess variability. The machine-learning algorithms were trained using the multispectral UAV-based data from a chestnut grove, and they were evaluated to predict LAI. The best achieved coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 85% indicated that the biophysical and geometrical parameters could explain the variability in LAI. This approach demonstrated that using multiple variables, such as vegetation indices and geometrical parameters, improved the estimation of LAI compared to using a single vegetation index. Additionally, a simple, reliable, and precise model was developed that relied on only two variables to estimate the LAI in individual chestnut trees."
