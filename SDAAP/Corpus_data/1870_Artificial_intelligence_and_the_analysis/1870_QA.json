        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of spectroscopic methods in metabolomic analysis, specifically nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS), demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) compared to traditional methods in the related study. The study utilized MS and NMR-based metabolomic analysis on cord blood serum samples from 40 IUGR cases and 40 controls. Three variable selection algorithms (Correlation-based feature selection, Partial least squares regression, and Learning Vector Quantization) were tested for their diagnostic performance. The selected set of metabolites, including an overlapping set identified by the three algorithms, achieved statistically significant accuracies in the range of 0.78-0.82 for their optimized support vector machine (SVM) models. The model utilizing all metabolites in the dataset had an AUC of 0.91, with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.80. This indicates that the spectroscopic methods used in metabolomic analysis provided superior accuracy in predicting IUGR compared to traditional methods."
