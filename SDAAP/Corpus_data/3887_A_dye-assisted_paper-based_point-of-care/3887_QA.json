        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, spectroscopic methods, specifically the dye-assisted paper assay, demonstrated comparable accuracy and reproducibility to the classical gel-card assays in grouping 3550 human blood samples. Therefore, spectroscopic methods can be considered as a superior alternative to traditional gel-card assays for blood grouping in terms of accuracy and reproducibility."
