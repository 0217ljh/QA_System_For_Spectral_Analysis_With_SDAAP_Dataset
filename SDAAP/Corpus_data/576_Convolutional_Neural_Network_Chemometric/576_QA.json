        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to accurately discriminate rocks with similar chemical compositions is the Brier score. The Brier score is a measure of the accuracy of probabilistic predictions, and it assesses the average squared difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes. \n\nThe Brier score can range from 0 to 1, with a lower score indicating better classification accuracy. In the related study, the Brier score was used to quantitatively inspect the classification accuracy of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model compared to other machine learning algorithms."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The CNN model outperforms traditional methods in accurately discriminating rocks with similar chemical compositions using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) coupled with chemometrics. The classification performance of the CNN model was compared with three alternative machine learning algorithms: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The CNN model achieved the highest classification correct rate, as assessed by precision score, recall score, and the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Additionally, the classification accuracy was quantitatively inspected using the Brier score, and the CNN model still performed the best. This demonstrates that the CNN-based chemometrics are an efficient tool for rock identification with LIBS spectra collected in a simulated Martian environment."
