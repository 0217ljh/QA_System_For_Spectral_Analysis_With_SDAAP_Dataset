        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the classifiers in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions was the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The AUC is a measure of the classifier's ability to distinguish between the two classes, with a value ranging from 0 to 1. A higher AUC indicates better performance in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. In the related study, the AUC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.88, suggesting that the classifiers using radiomic metrics extracted from CEM and DCE-MRI images had moderate to high discriminatory power in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions."

Therefore, it cannot be concluded whether spectroscopic methods were used or if they would have any impact on the diagnostic performance in this study."
