        "Output": "The metric chosen in the past study was classification accuracy. The past study aimed to evaluate the use of visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy in combination with multiple chemometric approaches for distinguishing four B. juncea varieties in Korea. The classification accuracy achieved varied depending on the preprocessing and chemometric approaches used. The combination of standard normal variate and deep learning had the highest classification accuracy, achieving up to 100% accuracy in all the growth stages. Similarly, other chemometric methods such as support vector machine, generalized linear model, and random forest also yielded 100% classification accuracy. Therefore, the chosen metric of classification accuracy was able to achieve perfect discrimination in this study."

It achieved a classification accuracy of 100% for distinguishing four B. juncea varieties using visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. This means that this combination was able to accurately differentiate between the different varieties of B. juncea in all growth stages. Other chemometric methods, such as support vector machine, generalized linear model, and random forest, also yielded 100% classification accuracy. However, the combination of standard normal variate and deep learning was specifically mentioned as having the highest accuracy."
