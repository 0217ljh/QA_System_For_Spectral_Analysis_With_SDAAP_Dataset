        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation models for predicting the contents of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and tin (Sn) in multi-media environments surrounding abandoned mineral processing plants is the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and actual values. \n\nThe R-2 value provides information about the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (metal(loid) concentrations in this case) that can be explained by the independent variables (hyperspectral data and machine learning algorithms). \n\nIn the related study, the R-2 values for the estimation models range from 0.75 to 0.93, indicating a relatively high level of accuracy in predicting the metal(loid) concentrations."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and continuum removal (CR) spectral preprocessing methods can be considered superior to traditional methods in predicting metal concentrations in multi-media environments surrounding abandoned mineral processing plants using hyperspectral technology combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. The study found that CWT and CR were excellent spectral pretreatments for the hyperspectral data regardless of the applied algorithms. The estimation models with the best accuracy for various metals (loid) were achieved using these preprocessing methods. Additionally, the coefficients of determination (R-2) for the estimation models using CWT and CR were high, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual metal concentrations. Therefore, these preprocessing methods, when combined with PLSR and ELM models, provide a potential new combinatorial approach for accurately estimating toxic metal contamination in multi-media environments."
