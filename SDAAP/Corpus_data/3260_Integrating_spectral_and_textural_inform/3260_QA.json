        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the new index was the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE value for the new index was 5.77 days, which was the lowest among all variables. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, providing an indication of the accuracy of the new index in identifying the Tasseling Date (TD). "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The integration of spectral and textural information using the Improved Adaptive Feature Weighting Method (IAFWM) outperformed traditional methods in identifying the Tasseling Date (TD) of summer maize. The results showed that the new index generated by integrating spectral and textural information using IAFWM had the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.77 days, which was lower than the RMSE of other variables. This indicates that the integration of spectral and textural information using IAFWM provided more accurate and precise identification of the TD compared to traditional methods."
