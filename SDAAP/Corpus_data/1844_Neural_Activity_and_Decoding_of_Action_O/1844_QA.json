        "Output": "The metric chosen in the study was a feature classification method. This method involved constructing complex brain networks based on the EEG and fNIRS data collected during action observation. The features extracted from these brain networks were then used to classify the neural processes underlying action observation. \n\nThe metric of feature classification achieved a classification accuracy of 72.7% for the three action observation tasks. This suggests that the chosen metric was able to decode the underlying neural processes to a moderate extent. However, it is important to note that the metric may have limitations and may not capture all aspects of the neural mechanisms involved in action observation and intention understanding. Further research and refinement of the metric may be necessary to achieve a more comprehensive decoding of the underlying neural processes."

The study demonstrated that by constructing complex brain networks based on EEG and fNIRS data and fusing features from both modalities, a classification accuracy of 72.7% was achieved for different action observation tasks. This suggests that the feature classification method has the potential to be applied to other studies investigating neural processes and intention understanding, allowing for the decoding of underlying neural mechanisms in various contexts. However, it is important to note that the applicability of this method may depend on the specific research question and the availability of suitable data from EEG and fNIRS measurements."
