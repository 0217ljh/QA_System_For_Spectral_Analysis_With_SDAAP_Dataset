        "Output": "The metric chosen to quantify soil salinity in the related study was the fractional derivative of absorbance. This metric was used to preprocess the spectral reflectance data obtained from the soil samples. The study found that the fractional derivative method improved the refinement of spectral characteristics in the reflectance data. \n\nIn terms of performance, the study compared two modeling methods, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF), using the preprocessed reflectance data. The results showed that the RF models performed better than the PLSR models in quantifying soil salinity. The most effective RF model was established using the 1.5 order derivative of absorbance, which achieved optimal values of R-2 (0.93), RMSE (4.57 dS m(-1)), and RPD (2.78 >= 2.50). \n\nOverall, the chosen metric of fractional derivative of absorbance performed well in the study, as it improved the accuracy of the RF model in determining soil salinity."

        "Output": "In the study, two machine learning models, namely partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF), were utilized for the detection and assessment of soil salinity using visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy. The raw spectral reflectance data collected from soil samples were preprocessed using the absorbance and fractional derivative order in the range of 0.0-2.0 order with an interval of 0.1. The preprocessed reflectance data were then used as input for the PLSR and RF models. These models were trained to establish a relationship between the spectral characteristics and the measured salinity values in the laboratory. The performance of the models was evaluated based on validation accuracies. The results showed that the RF models performed better than the PLSR models in quantifying soil salinity. The most effective RF model was established using the 1.5 order derivative of absorbance, with optimal values of R-2 (0.93), RMSE (4.57 dS m(-1)), and RPD (2.78 >= 2.50). This RF model was found to be stable and accurate in determining the soil salinity of the Ebinur Lake wetland using spectral reflectance data."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of fractional derivative in the pretreatment of visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy can be considered superior to traditional methods for the detection and assessment of soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake Wetland in China. The related study found that the spectral reflectance treated via fractional derivative refined more spectral characteristics, leading to improved accuracy in quantifying soil salinity. The results also showed that the random forest (RF) models, using preprocessed reflectance with fractional derivative, performed better than the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models. The most effective RF model was established based on the 1.5 order derivative of absorbance, achieving high values of R-2 (0.93), RMSE (4.57 dS m(-1)), and RPD (2.78 >= 2.50). This indicates that the developed RF model using fractional derivative pretreatment was stable and accurate in determining the soil salinity of the Ebinur Lake wetland. Therefore, the use of fractional derivative in the pretreatment of VIS-NIR spectroscopy can be considered superior for the detection and assessment of soil salinity in this specific area."
