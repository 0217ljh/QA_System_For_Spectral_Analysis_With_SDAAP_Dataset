        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the use of a portable fNIRS device for assessing hemodynamics during cognitive tasks shows potential as an adjunct diagnostic tool for mood disorders in low-resource environments. The study found that the device was able to differentiate between individuals with bipolar disorder, unipolar disorder, and healthy controls based on differences in oxy-hemoglobin levels in the frontal cortex during cognitive tasks. The device demonstrated moderate accuracy in distinguishing between bipolar disorder and healthy controls, as well as between unipolar disorder and healthy controls."
