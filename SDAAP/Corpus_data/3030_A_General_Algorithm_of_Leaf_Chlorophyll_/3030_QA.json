        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate plant leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is the modified difference ratio index (MDRI). This metric was found to have the strongest linear relationship (R-2 = 0.92) with LCC among all the tested spectral indices. The linear algorithm derived from the MDRI was found to be the most effective for estimating LCC across a wide range of plant species under different measurement conditions. The validation results from 2024 leaves (114 plant species) confirmed that the MDRI-based algorithm had a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.72 \u6e2dg/cm(2). Therefore, the MDRI metric can accurately estimate LCC across different plant species and measurement conditions."

        "Output": "Yes, the linear algorithm derived from the MDRI spectrum method can be used to accurately estimate plant leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) across different plant species and measurement conditions, as determined in the related study evaluating different spectral indices for estimating LCC. The related study found that the MDRI had the strongest linear relationship to LCC among all the tested spectral indices, with an R-squared value of 0.92. The validation results from a large dataset of leaves from 114 plant species confirmed that the linear algorithm derived from the MDRI was the most effective for estimating LCC, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.72 \u6e2dg/cm2. The MDRI does not require parameterization for each plant species and can be used with a simple handheld laboratory or field instrument at any arbitrary direction, making it convenient for botanical and ecological studies under different measurement conditions."
