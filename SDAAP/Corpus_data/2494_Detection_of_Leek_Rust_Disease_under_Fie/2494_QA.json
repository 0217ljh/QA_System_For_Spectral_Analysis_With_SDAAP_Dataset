        "Output": "The research used first order derivation and smoothing without normalization, and selected the 702 nm wavelength reflectance value to isolate soil spectra. Additionally, a dedicated soil classification model was developed to distinguish soil spectra from rust, healthy leek crops, and weed spectra."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it can be inferred that the developed methodology for detecting leek rust disease using hyperspectral proximal sensing data and supervised machine learning is considered superior to traditional methods. This is indicated by the high accuracy of the best performing model, a logistic regression model, which was able to correctly classify rust disease with an accuracy of 98.14%. Traditional methods, such as periodical full-field fungicide applications, may not be as accurate or efficient in preventing the spread of the disease."
