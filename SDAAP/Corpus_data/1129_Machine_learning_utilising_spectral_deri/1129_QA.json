The spectral data was collected between 2500-3500 nm using a portable prototype device. \n\nSeveral pre-processing data types were used for analysis, including 'raw' unprocessed data, smoothed resampling data, background subtracted data, and spectral derivative data. \n\nThe resulting clusters obtained from the machine learning algorithms were utilized as a diagnostic tool for assessing cellular health. The accuracy of the clustering was quantified using both sensitivity and specificity measures. \n\nThe study found that the raw data exhibited differences for one of the three different trauma types applied, but it was unable to accurately cluster all the traumatised samples due to signal contamination from the chemical insult. \n\nThe background subtracted and smoothed data sets further reduced the accuracy, as they appeared to remove key spectral features that are indicative of cellular health. \n\nHowever, the spectral derivative data types significantly improved the accuracy of clustering compared to other data types. The background subtracted data set, in particular, showed sensitivity and specificity values of over 94%, highlighting its utility in accounting for unknown signal contamination while still maintaining important"
