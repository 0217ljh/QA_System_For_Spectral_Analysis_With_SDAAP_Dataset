        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models for detecting internal mechanical damage in blueberries is accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and false positive rate. These metrics are used to quantify the performance of the classifiers in detecting internal mechanical damage of blueberries using hyperspectral transmittance data. Additionally, ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves are plotted to visualize the performance of the classifiers.\n\nThe accuracy metric measures the overall correctness of the classification results. Precision measures the proportion of correctly classified positive instances out of all instances classified as positive. Recall measures the proportion of correctly classified positive instances out of all actual positive instances. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the classifier's performance. The false positive rate quantifies the rate at which the classifier incorrectly classifies negative instances as positive."
