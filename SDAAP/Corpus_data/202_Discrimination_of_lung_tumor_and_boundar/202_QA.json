        "input": "",
        "Output": "The RF-Boosting Tree model contributes to the identification of lung tumor boundaries by improving the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, and AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the classification process. It achieves this by combining the Random Forest (RF) feature selection technique with the Boosting Tree classification model.\n\nThe RF feature selection helps optimize the input variables by retaining important data information, removing redundant information and interference, and reducing training time. This ensures that only the most relevant features are used for classification, enhancing the accuracy of the model.\n\nThe Boosting Tree classification model, when combined with RF feature selection, further improves the performance of the classification process. It leverages the principle of ensemble learning, where multiple weak classifiers are combined to create a strong classifier. This helps in accurately distinguishing between lung tumor and boundary tissues.\n\nOverall, the RF-Boosting Tree model shows the highest accuracy of 98.9%, making it a rapid and robust method for the identification of lung tumor boundaries using Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)."
