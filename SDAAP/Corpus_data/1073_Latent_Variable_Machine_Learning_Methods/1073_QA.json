        "Output": "The purpose of using support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) in the modeling analysis of protein content in instant coffee using NIR spectroscopy was to validate their practicality and evaluate their performance in predicting protein content. These machine learning methods, combined with latent variable analysis technique, were used to develop analytical models based on the NIR data. The tuning of latent variables and optimization of key parameters in the machines were done jointly, allowing for data dimension reduction and selection of machine parameters in a single modeling process. The models were trained using a calibrating sample set and then validated and tested using separate sample sets. The performance of the SVM and ELM models was compared to the common partial least square method, and it was found that the SVM and ELM methods provided better prediction results. This demonstrated the application advantages of the latent variable machine learning methods in near-infrared quantitative analysis and suggested their potential for content detection in other types of coffee."

This is supported by the text, which states that the LV-SVM and LV-ELM methods have better prediction results compared to the common partial least square method. The optimal LV-SVM model had a validating root mean square error of 6.797 and a testing root mean square error of 8.384, while the optimal LV-ELM model had a validating root mean square error of 6.118 and a testing root mean square error of 7.837. These results verify the application advantages of the latent variable machine learning methods in near-infrared quantitative analysis."
