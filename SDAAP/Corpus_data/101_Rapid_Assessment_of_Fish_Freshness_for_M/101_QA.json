        "Output": "Past study used three spectral modes in developing the handheld multimode spectroscopic system for fish quality assessment. These modes include visible near infra-red (VIS-NIR) reflectance and fluorescence (FL) spectroscopy, as well as short wave infra-red (SWIR) reflectance spectroscopy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric used for fish quality assessment was classification accuracy. The multi-mode spectroscopy achieved 95% accuracy, improving the accuracies of the FL, VIS-NIR, and SWIR single-mode spectroscopies by 26%, 10%, and 9% respectively."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Multiple machine learning techniques were used to train classification models for predicting the freshness of fish. These techniques include principal component analysis, self-organized maps, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, and linear regression. Additionally, ensemble and majority voting methods were also employed."

        "instruction": "How does the accuracy of multi-mode spectroscopy compare to traditional methods in classifying fish freshness and predicting shelf life?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of multi-mode spectroscopy in classifying fish freshness and predicting shelf life is significantly higher compared to traditional methods. Multi-mode spectroscopy achieved a 95% accuracy rate, which is a substantial improvement over the accuracies of single-mode spectroscopies. Specifically, the multi-mode spectroscopy improved the accuracies of fluorescence (FL), visible near infra-red (VIS-NIR), and short wave infra-red (SWIR) single-mode spectroscopies by 26%, 10%, and 9% respectively. This indicates that the combination of different spectroscopic modes and data fusion analysis greatly enhances the ability to assess freshness and predict the shelf life of fish fillets."
