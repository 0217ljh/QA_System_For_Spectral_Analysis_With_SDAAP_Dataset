        "Output": "Based on the information provided, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and machine learning can be considered superior to traditional methods in analyzing the association between glioblastoma stages and spectral patterns of mouse blood serum measured in the terahertz range. The research used THz-TDS and machine learning techniques to analyze the spectral patterns of mouse blood serum and establish a relation between glioblastoma stages and the THz spectral profile. The past study achieved high prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, indicating the effectiveness of this approach in detecting glioma stages using blood serum spectral patterns in the terahertz range."
