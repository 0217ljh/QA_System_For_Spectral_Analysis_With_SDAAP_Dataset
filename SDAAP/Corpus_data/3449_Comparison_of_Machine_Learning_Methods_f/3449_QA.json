        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the related study, the accuracy and precision of estimating leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) of Cinnamomum camphora using UAV multispectral technology can be considered superior to traditional methods. The study used remote sensing images obtained by the multispectral camera of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assess LAI and AGB. The results showed that the XGBoost model, followed by GBDT, RF, RFNN, and SVR, provided the highest accuracy for estimating LAI and AGB. The XGBoost-based LAI model had an R2 of 0.862 and an RMSE of 0.390, while the XGBoost-based AGB model had an R2 of 0.929 and an RMSE of 587.746 kg/ha. These results suggest that UAV multispectral technology can provide a more accurate and precise estimation of LAI and AGB compared to traditional methods."
