This method can separate water from clouds, build-up areas, shadows, and shadowed water. LVQ has shown robustness, consistency, and preciseness in various challenging environments and can achieve overall accuracies and kappa coefficients between 97.8% and 99.7% and between 0.96 and 0.99, respectively. LVQ has demonstrated a good generalizing ability to detect all types of water with a minimal amount of training samples."

        "Output": "Yes, the proposed learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network-based method can be easily adapted for other sensors and global water to support water resource studies. The method has demonstrated robustness, consistency, and preciseness in various challenging conditions, such as dark surfaces, noisy water environments, and highly water scarce scenes. This indicates that the method is capable of effectively extracting water from different types of remote sensing data. Additionally, the model has shown good generalizing ability, requiring less training samples to detect all types of water. These qualities make the LVQ method suitable for application with other sensors and in global water resource studies."
