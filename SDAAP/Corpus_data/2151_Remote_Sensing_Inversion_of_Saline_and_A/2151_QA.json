        "Output": "The proposed inversion model, which is based on the two-hidden-layer extreme learning machine (TELM) and the seagull optimization algorithm (SOA), contributes to the real-time monitoring of saline and alkaline land treatment on a large scale through remote sensing inversion in the following ways:\n\n1. Obtaining spectral data and salt content: The model allows for the collection of spectral data and salt content samples from saline and alkaline land. This data is crucial for monitoring the evolution and treatment of such land.\n\n2. Improved seagull optimization algorithm (ISOA): The model incorporates an improved version of the SOA, known as the ISOA. This algorithm utilizes opposition-based learning (OBL), the Cauchy distribution, and inverse S-shaped functions to enhance the optimization process.\n\n3. Enhanced TELM: The model introduces the HS-TELM, which is a TELM based on the hyperparameter activation function and the ISOA. This improved version of TELM helps in accurately predicting and monitoring the treatment of saline and alkaline land.\n\n4. Various improved algorithms: The model proposes a series of improved algorithms based on the ISOA and TELM. These include ISOA-TELM, D-TELM, ISOA-HS-TE"
