        "Output": "The researchers used fluorescence spectroscopy to develop a non-invasive method for determining glycosuria in diabetes mellitus by recording the fluorescent spectra from urine samples. They used a Xenon arc lamp as an excitation source to emit light in the range of 200-950 nm. By analyzing the fluorescence emission peaks, they found a consistent peak of glucose at 450 nm for an excitation wavelength of 370 nm in all the urine samples. They also acquired fluorescence spectra from non-diabetic individuals (healthy controls) for comparison. The researchers observed that the fluorescence emission intensity at 450 nm increased with increasing glucose concentration in urine. Additionally, they used optimized synchronous fluorescence emission at 357 nm to determine the level of tryptophan (Trp) in urine, which is a potential diabetes biomarker. They found that the level of tryptophan decreased with increasing urinary glucose concentration. The researchers quantitatively estimated urinary glucose based on the intensity of emission light carried by fluorescence. They also used hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) algorithm to further emphasize the dissimilarities between the fluorescence emission signatures of diabetic and non-diabetic samples. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that urinary glucose and tryptophan fluorescence emission can be used as potential biomarkers for the"
