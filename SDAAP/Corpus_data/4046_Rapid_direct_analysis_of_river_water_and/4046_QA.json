        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized in the in silico suspect screening process of passive sampler extracts for the identification of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in river water by assisting in the retention time prediction. After shortlisting 59 additional compounds based on mass spectral database matching, machine learning algorithms were used to predict the retention times of these compounds. This allowed for the identification of new metabolites, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides that were not initially targeted in the analysis. The combination of machine learning-assisted retention time prediction and mass spectral database matching enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of the suspect screening process."
