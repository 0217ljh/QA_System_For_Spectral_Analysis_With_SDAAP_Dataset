        "input": "",
        "Output": "Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy was used to detect adulteration of ground nutmeg with nutmeg shell. The researchers analyzed 36 authentic nutmeg samples and 10 nutmeg shell samples, both pure and in mixtures with up to 50% shell content. They collected spectra data from these samples using FT-NIR spectroscopy. The spectra plot and a principal component analysis were then used to observe a clear separation trend based on the shell content. Additionally, a support vector machine regression model was employed to predict the shell content, achieving an R-2 value of 0.944 in the range of 0-10% shell content. The limit of detection for the prediction model was estimated to be 1.5% nutmeg shell. Based on random sub-sampling, the likelihood was found to be 2% that a pure nutmeg sample is predicted with a nutmeg shell content of >1%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FT-NIR spectroscopy for rapid detection and quantitation of the shell content in ground nutmeg."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy was found to be effective in detecting adulteration of ground nutmeg with nutmeg shell. It was compared to traditional methods and proved to be a rapid and reliable technique for this purpose. The spectra plot and principal component analysis showed a clear separation trend based on the shell content, indicating the ability of FT-NIR spectroscopy to differentiate between pure nutmeg and mixtures with shell content. Additionally, a support vector machine regression model achieved a high R-2 value of 0.944 for shell content prediction in the range of 0-10%. The limit of detection for the prediction model was estimated to be 1.5% nutmeg shell. Overall, the results confirm the suitability of FT-NIR spectroscopy as a valuable tool for the detection and quantitation of nutmeg shell adulteration in ground nutmeg."
