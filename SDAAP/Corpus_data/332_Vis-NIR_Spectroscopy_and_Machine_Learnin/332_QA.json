        "Output": "The metric chosen in distinguish genetically modified (GM) and non-GM Brassica napus, B. juncea, and F-1 hybrids was classification accuracy. The past study found that the combination of standard normal variate preprocessing and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.4% in distinguishing between GM, non-GM, and hybrid plants. Additionally, the use of deep learning in combination with Savitzky-Golay preprocessing resulted in a classification accuracy of 99.1%. Therefore, the chosen metric of classification accuracy was able to achieve high levels of accuracy in differentiating between GM and non-GM plants using handheld Vis-NIR spectroscopy and chemometric analyses."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of standard normal variate and support vector machine, as well as the use of deep learning in combination with Savitzky-Golay, can be considered superior to traditional methods for distinguishing between genetically modified (GM) and non-genetically modified Brassica napus, B. juncea, and F-1 hybrids using visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric analyses. According to the findings mentioned in the past study, the combination of standard normal variate and support vector machine achieved a classification accuracy of 99.4%, while the use of deep learning in combination with Savitzky-Golay resulted in a classification accuracy of 99.1%. These accuracies indicate that these combinations of methods are highly effective in accurately discriminating between GM and non-GM plants."
