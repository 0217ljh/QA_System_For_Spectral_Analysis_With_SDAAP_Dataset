        "Output": "Incorporating Gabor transformed images and hierarchical land classes can potentially improve the accuracy of land cover classification using object-based image analysis (OBIA) in a riparian area in Southeast Iowa, United States. The study aims to observe the difference in segmentation and classification accuracy when a Gabor transformed image is fused with other data sources such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), high resolution multi-spectral imagery (RGB and NIR), and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived canopy height model (CHM).\n\nThe Gabor Transform, a texture transformation technique, is not commonly used in Geographic Object Based Image Analyses (GEOBIA/OBIA). By incorporating this rarely used texture transformation, the study seeks to maximize the detailed information available in ultra-high resolution imagery. This can potentially enhance the ability to identify and classify land cover types accurately.\n\nFurthermore, the study also explores the use of hierarchical land classes as an attribute within the machine learning step of OBIA. Hierarchical organization of landscapes is not commonly utilized in the GEOBIA process. By incorporating hierarchical information, the study aims to improve the delineation and classification of objects within the riparian landscape."
