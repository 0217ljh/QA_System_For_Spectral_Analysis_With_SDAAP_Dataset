        "Output": "The results of comparing and analyzing the impacts of pretreatment, selection of characteristic wavenumbers, and parameter optimization on the model performance in identifying the authenticity, botanical sources, and geographical origins of Atractylodis rhizoma (AR) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with machine learning methods showed that the extreme learning machine (ELM) had the best effect in identifying the authenticity of AR. The back propagation neural network (BPNN) had advantages in determining the sources of plants. The support vector classification (SVC) had great potential to pinpoint the geographical origins of Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC. and Atractylodes chinensis (DC.) Koidz. Additionally, the feasibility of direct spectral acquisition without crushing the sample was also demonstrated. Overall, NIRS combined with machine learning proved to be a fast, effective, and feasible method for identifying the authenticity, botanical sources, and geographical origins of AR."

        "Output": "Based on the results of past study, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with machine learning can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for identifying the authenticity, botanical sources, and geographical origins of Atractylodis rhizoma (AR). The past study compared the impacts of different factors on model performance and found that NIRS combined with machine learning had the best effect in identifying the authenticity of AR. Additionally, machine learning methods such as the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector classification (SVC) showed advantages in determining the sources of plants and pinpointing the geographical origins of different Atractylodes species. The feasibility of direct spectral acquisition without crushing the sample was also demonstrated, making the method fast, effective, and feasible. Therefore, based on these findings, NIRS combined with machine learning can be considered a superior method for identifying the authenticity, botanical sources, and geographical origins of AR compared to traditional methods."
