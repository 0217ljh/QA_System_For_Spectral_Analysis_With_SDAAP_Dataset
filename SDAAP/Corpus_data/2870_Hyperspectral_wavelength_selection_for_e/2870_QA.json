        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of the regularized elimination procedure and Cubist outperformed other variable selection methods and machine learning algorithms in estimating chlorophyll content in plants using hyperspectral remote-sensing. It achieved the highest ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 1.76 and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.42 \u6e2dg cm(-2). This indicates that the regularized elimination procedure and Cubist combination provided the most accurate and reliable estimation of chlorophyll content compared to the other methods and algorithms evaluated in the study."
