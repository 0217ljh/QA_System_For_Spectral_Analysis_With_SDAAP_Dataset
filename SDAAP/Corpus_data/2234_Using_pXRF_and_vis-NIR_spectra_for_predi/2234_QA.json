        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of pXRF and vis-NIR spectra can be considered superior to traditional methods for predicting soil properties in different horizons in loess soils. The study found that pXRF spectra had better prediction performance for clay, silt, and sand, while vis-NIR spectra produced better predictions for total carbon (TC) and pH. The best prediction performance for sand, silt, and clay was achieved using the combination of vis-NIR+XRF40+XRF10 spectra in the B horizon. Similarly, the best prediction performance for TC and pH was achieved using the combination of vis-NIR+XRF40+XRF10 spectra in the A+B horizon. These results suggest that the combination of pXRF and vis-NIR spectra can provide high accuracy in predicting soil properties in different horizons in loess soils."
