        "Output": "The performance of the GPR technique in predicting soil properties using portable MIR spectroscopy data was found to be superior to other machine learning techniques. In the study, various machine learning techniques including Gaussian process regression (GPR), Random Forest (RF), M5 rules, Bagging and Decision Trees, were compared with traditional Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). While all the models showed satisfactory performance, GPR stood out as the best performing algorithm according to statistical tests. \n\nSpecifically, GPR outperformed PLSR in predicting clay, exchangeable sodium (Na+), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) with root mean squared error differences of -0.27%, -0.40%, and -0.63 cmol(+) kg(-1), respectively. This indicates that GPR provided more accurate predictions for these soil properties compared to PLSR. \n\nOverall, the study demonstrated that the GPR technique is the most suitable and reliable approach for predicting soil properties using portable MIR spectroscopy data."
