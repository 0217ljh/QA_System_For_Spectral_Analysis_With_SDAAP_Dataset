        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of a near-infrared hyperspectral camera and an industrial camera contributes to the efficient classification of construction waste in the online classification system by providing both visual and spectral information about the objects. The industrial camera captures the visual image of the region of interest, while the near-infrared hyperspectral camera obtains the spectral information about the objects in that region. \n\nBy using the hyperspectral camera, the system is able to gather detailed spectral data, which can be used to build classification models. This spectral information helps in distinguishing different types of construction waste based on their unique spectral signatures. \n\nThe combination of visual and spectral information allows for a more accurate and comprehensive classification of construction waste. It enables the system to identify and separate different materials, such as wood, metal, plastic, or concrete, which have different recovery values. \n\nOverall, the integration of a near-infrared hyperspectral camera and an industrial camera in the online classification system enhances the efficiency of construction waste classification by providing a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of the waste materials."
