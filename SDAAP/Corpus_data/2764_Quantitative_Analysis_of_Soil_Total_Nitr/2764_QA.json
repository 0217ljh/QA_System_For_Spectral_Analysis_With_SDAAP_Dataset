        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the results and findings of the related study, the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for the detection and visualization of total nitrogen (TN) content in soil samples can be considered superior to traditional methods. The study compared the performance of HSI models using characteristic wavelengths extracted through uninformative variable elimination (UVE) and the successive projections algorithm (SPA) with traditional calibration models using full spectra. The results showed that the nonlinear extreme learning machine (ELM) model using characteristic wavelengths achieved better prediction performance than the linear partial least squares (PLS) model using full spectra. The UVE-ELM model had a correlation coefficient of prediction (r(p)) of 0.9408, root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.0075, and residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 2.97. These results indicate that HSI, particularly when combined with characteristic wavelengths, can provide accurate and reliable predictions of TN content in soil samples. Therefore, HSI can be considered superior to traditional methods for soil nutrient detection and visualization."
