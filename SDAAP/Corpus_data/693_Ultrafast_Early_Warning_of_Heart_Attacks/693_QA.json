        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of nanofingers and ML algorithms in the developed machine learning-driven system can be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting heart attacks early. Traditional methods typically have a detection time of over 15 minutes, which is too long considering the rapid passage of life during a heart attack. However, the developed system has a short detection time of only 10 seconds. Additionally, the system utilizes a functionalized nanofinger structure that can capture even trace amounts of biomarkers leaked before a heart attack. This allows for early intervention and the potential to rescue lives threatened by heart disease. Furthermore, the system incorporates five ML models that harness the useful characteristics of each Raman spectrum, providing early warnings of heart attacks with over 98% accuracy. Overall, the combination of nanofingers and ML algorithms in the developed system offers a more efficient, low-cost, and high-precision approach to early detection of heart attacks compared to traditional methods."
