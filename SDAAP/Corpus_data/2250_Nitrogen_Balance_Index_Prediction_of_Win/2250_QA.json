        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the NBI estimation models is the relative prediction deviation (RPD). The RPD measures the accuracy of the NBI predictions by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. In this study, the NBI estimation model based on the LOGS-RFR method in the filling stage achieved an RPD of 3.69. This indicates that the model can explain 95% of the NBI variability and has a relatively high level of accuracy in predicting NBI values."

The researchers collected ground-level canopy hyperspectral reflectance data and corresponding plant NBI values at different growth stages of winter wheat. They then derived continuous removal spectra (CRS) and logarithmic transformation spectra (LOGS) from the original canopy spectra.\n\nThe researchers selected sensitive bands and vegetation indices (VIs) that showed high correlation with NBI under different spectral transformations. These hyperspectral features were used to construct NBI estimation models in combination with ML algorithms.\n\nThe ML algorithms used in the study included random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and partial least squares regression (PLS). The researchers compared the performance of these algorithms in predicting NBI.\n\nThe study found that the spectral transformation significantly improved the correlation between the sensitive bands, VIs, and NBI. The correlation coefficient of the sensitive band in CRS in the booting stage increased by 27.87%, reaching -0.78.

        "Output": "The study demonstrated the superiority of spectral transformation combined with machine learning methods in estimating the winter wheat nitrogen balance index (NBI) compared to traditional methods in several ways:\n\n1. Improved correlation: The spectral transformation significantly improved the correlation between the sensitive bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and the NBI. For example, in the booting stage, the correlation coefficient of the sensitive band in continuous removal spectra (CRS) increased by 27.87%, reaching -0.78. Similarly, the leaf chlorophyll index (LCI) in logarithmic transformation spectra (LOGS) had the highest correlation with NBI in the filling stage, reaching a correlation coefficient of -0.96.\n\n2. Better prediction accuracy: The NBI prediction accuracies based on the sensitive band combined with VIs were generally better than those based on the univariate hyperspectral feature. Additionally, the prediction accuracy of each growth stage was better than that of the whole growth stage. This suggests that considering hyperspectral features at specific growth stages improves the accuracy of NBI estimation.\n\n3. Superior machine learning method: The random forest regression (RFR) method performed better than the support vector regression (SVR) and partial least squares regression (PLS) methods.
