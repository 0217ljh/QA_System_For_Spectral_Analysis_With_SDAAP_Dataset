        "input": "",
        "Output": "The significance of the Wavelength-based Hybrid Feature Selection strategy in the proposed methodology is that it allows for the selection of relevant information from the spectrum, specifically the relevant wavelengths. This strategy combines filters and wrappers to determine which wavelengths are most important for the analysis. By selecting only the relevant wavelengths, the dimensionality and complexity of the spectrum are reduced, while still maintaining the same detection accuracy. This feature selection strategy enables different trade-offs in terms of spectrum dimensionality, complexity, and detection quality, providing flexibility in tailoring the methodology to the specific requirements of each case."
