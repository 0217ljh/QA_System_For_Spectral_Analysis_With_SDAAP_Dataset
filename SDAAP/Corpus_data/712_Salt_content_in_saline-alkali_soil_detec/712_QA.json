        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the salt detection model is the coefficient of determination (R-squared value) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) value. The coefficient of determination value of 0.9 indicates that the model can explain 90% of the variability in the salt content of SAS. The RMSE value of 1.55 indicates the average difference between the predicted and actual salt content values. Therefore, based on these metrics, the salt detection model can accurately detect the salt content of SAS with a high level of accuracy."

        "Output": "The proposed method for rapid detection of salt content in SAS is more time and cost-saving compared to traditional chemical analysis methods. The related study states that the experimental results show the proposed method can effectively detect the salt content with a coefficient of determination value of 0.9 and a root-mean-square error value of 1.55. This indicates that the proposed method is accurate in determining the salt content. Additionally, the related study mentions that the proposed method achieves online rapid detection, implying that it can provide real-time results. \n\nIn contrast, traditional chemical analysis methods are typically time-consuming and costly. These methods involve collecting samples and conducting laboratory tests, which can take a significant amount of time. Moreover, chemical analysis methods often require specialized equipment and trained personnel, leading to higher costs.\n\nTherefore, the proposed method offers a more efficient and cost-effective approach for detecting salt content in SAS compared to traditional chemical analysis methods."
