        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the use of recently launched PRISMA spaceborne satellite images in mapping hydrothermally altered and weathered minerals  was a combination of measures including accuracy, kappa coefficient, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC curve. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the models' performance in terms of classification accuracy, agreement between predicted and observed values, and the balance between precision and recall.\n\nThe extent to which these metrics can go depends on the specific values obtained for each measure. Higher values for accuracy, kappa coefficient, F1 score, precision, recall, and area under the ROC curve indicate better performance of the models. However, the specific threshold for considering a model as \"good\" or \"acceptable\" may vary depending on the application and the desired level of accuracy. Therefore, the interpretation of these metrics and their significance in evaluating model performance can vary."

The related study focused on the town of Jahazpur in Rajasthan, India. \n\nFirst, a distribution map for minerals such as kaolinite, talc, and montmorillonite was generated using the spectral angle mapper technique. This map served as a reference for the mineral distribution in the area.\n\nNext, an intensive field validation survey was conducted to verify the accuracy of the mineral distribution map. Surface exposures of the minerals were examined and compared to the map.\n\nThe obtained pixels of the end-members, which are representative samples of the minerals, were then used to develop the machine-learning-based classification models. These models were trained using various algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent and artificial-neural-network-based multilayer perceptron classifiers.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the developed models, measures such as accuracy, kappa coefficient, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC curve were employed. These measures helped assess the accuracy and reliability of the models in mapping the hydrothermally altered and weathered minerals.\n\nThe results of the related study showed that the stochastic gradient descent and artificial-neural-network-based multilayer perceptron classifiers"
