        "Output": "In the proposed ensemble deep learning based approach for soft sensor modeling, the deep learning network, near neighbor learning part, and random vector functional-link (RVFL) network play different roles.\n\n1. Deep Learning Network: The deep learning network is responsible for learning the features of the 1H NMR spectral data. It is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). The deep learning network can automatically extract relevant features from the input data, allowing it to capture complex patterns and relationships. In this approach, the deep learning network is used to extract meaningful representations from the spectral data, enabling accurate evaluation of crude oil fraction yield.\n\n2. Near Neighbor Learning Part: The near neighbor learning part is a component that utilizes the concept of nearest neighbors to enhance the soft sensor modeling. It involves finding the most similar samples to the input data and using their information to improve the accuracy of the model. By incorporating the information from similar samples, the near neighbor learning part helps to refine the predictions made by the deep learning network, leading to more precise evaluation of crude oil fraction yield.\n\n3.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed soft sensor modeling approach using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral data can be considered superior to traditional methods for evaluating the fraction yield of crude oil. The traditional method of properties evaluation in the laboratory is time-consuming, while the near-infrared spectrum technology has limitations in terms of accuracy and application conditions. In contrast, the use of NMR allows for more accurate and efficient evaluation of crude oil properties. The ensemble deep learning based soft sensor modeling approach presented in the paper effectively learns the features of the 1H NMR spectral data and improves the accuracy of fraction yield evaluation. This suggests that the proposed approach can provide a more reliable and efficient alternative to traditional methods for evaluating the fraction yield of crude oil."
