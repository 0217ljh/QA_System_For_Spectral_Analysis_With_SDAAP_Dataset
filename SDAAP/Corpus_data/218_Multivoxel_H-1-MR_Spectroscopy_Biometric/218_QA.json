These metabolites included N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) + NAAG (NAA), Cr + PCr (total creatine, tCr), Glu + Gln (Glx), lactate (Lac), myo-inositol (Ins), GPC + PCho (total choline, tCho), and total lipids, and macromolecule (tMM) signals. The concentrations of these metabolites were reported as absolute concentrations or ratios to tCho or tCr levels. This metric was used to assess the differences and prognostic value of these metabolites in differentiating and predicting outcomes for patients with brain metastases, low-grade glioma, and high-grade glioma."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) biometrics can be considered superior to traditional methods for preoperative differentiation and prognosis of patients with brain metastases (MET), low-grade glioma (LGG), and high-grade glioma (HGG). The past study found that 1H-MRS imaging data, specifically the neurochemical profiles of certain metabolites, were able to provide prognostic information for overall survival (OS) in patients with HGG, LGG, and MET. Additionally, the combination of different biometrics yielded high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between HGG/LGG and LGG/MET. These findings suggest that multivoxel 1H-MRSI can provide valuable information for preoperative differentiation and prognosis in these patients."
