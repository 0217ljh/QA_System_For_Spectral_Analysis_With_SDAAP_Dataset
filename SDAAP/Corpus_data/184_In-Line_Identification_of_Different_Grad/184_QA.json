The classification accuracy on the validation set of the PLS-DA model with the optimal principal components of 3 can reach 90.4%. On the other hand, the classification accuracy on the validation set of the RF model with the first five principal components as input variables can reach 95.6%. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of classification accuracy can achieve accuracy levels of 90.4% and 95.6% for the PLS-DA and RF models, respectively."

        "Output": "Machine learning algorithms were utilized in the development of the in-line near-infrared spectral measurement system for grade identification of different grades of GPPS during the extrusion process. Specifically, two machine learning algorithms, namely Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Random Forest (RF), were used to establish grade identification models.\n\nThe PLS-DA algorithm was employed to create a prediction model. It utilized the optimal principal components, which were determined to be three, as input variables. The classification accuracy of the PLS-DA model on the validation set reached 90.4%.\n\nSimilarly, the RF algorithm was also used to establish a grade identification model. In this case, the first five principal components were used as input variables. The RF model achieved a higher classification accuracy on the validation set, reaching 95.6%.\n\nThe comparison between the two models showed that the RF model had better grade identification performance than the PLS-DA model.\n\nTherefore, by combining chemometrics and machine learning algorithms, the in-line near-infrared spectral measurement system was able to rapidly and accurately identify different grades of GPPS during the extrusion process."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the in-line near-infrared spectral measurement system, combined with chemometrics and machine learning algorithms, can be considered a superior method for the fast and real-time identification of different grades of GPPS during the polymer processing in a production line, compared to traditional methods. The past study states that the traditional methods for identifying grades of the same kind of polymer are usually time-consuming and hysteretic. In contrast, the developed system using near-infrared spectroscopy, along with chemometrics and machine learning algorithms, allows for fast and in-line identification of different grades of GPPS during the extrusion process. The results show that the system has a high clustering accuracy of 88% and classification accuracies of 90.4% and 95.6% for the PLS-DA and RF models, respectively. Therefore, this method provides a more efficient and effective way to identify different grades of GPPS in real-time during polymer processing."
