        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning approaches used in the past study were found to be effective for the rapid quantification of sugar-free Yangwei granules using NIR spectroscopy. The developed prediction models for the three active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) showed good performance in model fitting and provided satisfactory prediction accuracy. The correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error of calibration set (RMSEC), and root mean square error of prediction set (RMSEP) were used to assess the performance of the models, and all models performed well in these metrics. The results indicate that the machine learning approaches, including interval partial least squares optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA-iPLS), the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), and the particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM), are stable, predictable, and suitable for the quantification of Chinese medicine granules (CMGs) when high-accuracy analysis is required. Therefore, the machine learning approaches were effective in the past study for the rapid quantification of sugar-free Yangwei granules using NIR spectroscopy."
