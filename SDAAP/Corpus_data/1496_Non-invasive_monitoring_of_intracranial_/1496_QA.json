        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, it can be inferred that the pulsatile near infrared spectroscopic waveform features show promise in evaluating the association between induced changes in intracranial pressure and these features in healthy volunteers. The study found significant differences in the features extracted from the pulsatile signals, indicating the technique's ability to distinguish between variations in intracranial pressure. Additionally, classification models utilizing these features were able to identify changes in intracranial pressure with a reasonable level of sensitivity and specificity. However, it is important to note that further research is required to develop predictive models and establish a gold standard measurement for non-invasive, continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure. Therefore, while the pulsatile near infrared spectroscopic waveform features show potential, it is premature to conclude that they are a superior method compared to traditional methods at this stage."
