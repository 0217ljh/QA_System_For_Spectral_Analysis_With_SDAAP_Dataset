        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, the machine learning model was used to determine the grade of molybdenum ores by combining Visible-infrared spectroscopy with the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. The ELM algorithm was chosen due to the non-linear behavior of the spectral data. The Golden Jackal Optimization of adaptive T-distribution was used to optimize the parameters of the ELM model. Additionally, the ELM output matrix was decomposed using the improved truncated singular value decomposition to solve ill-posed problems. The resulting method, called MTSVD-TGJO-ELM, showed the highest accuracy compared to other classical machine learning algorithms. This approach provided a new and efficient method for rapidly detecting the ore grade in the mining process and improving the accuracy of molybdenum ore beneficiation."
