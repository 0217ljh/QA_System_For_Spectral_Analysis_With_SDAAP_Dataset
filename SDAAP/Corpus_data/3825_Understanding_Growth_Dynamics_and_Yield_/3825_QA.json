        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to predict end-of-season above-ground biomass (AGB) from the high-resolution time-series imagery was canopy surface height (CSM). This metric, along with ground cover (GC) and five common spectral indices, were considered as features of the crop phenotype. The study found that the power to predict end-of-season AGB was greatest at 50 days after planting, accounting for 63% of variance across the germplasm collection with a modest error (RMSE 1.8 Mg/ha). Therefore, the CSM metric was able to accurately predict end-of-season AGB with a reasonable level of accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of high-resolution time-series imagery and spectroscopic methods can be considered superior to traditional methods in predicting end-of-season above-ground biomass (AGB) in diverse accessions of sorghum crops. The study tested the use of high-resolution time-series imagery and found that it improved the prediction of end-of-season AGB earlier in the growing season. By leveraging early- and mid-season measurements of the rate of change of geometric and spectral features, the study achieved improved predictions of end-of-season AGB. Additionally, the study found that canopy surface height (CSM) on a given date was the most influential predictor of end-of-season AGB late in the season. The power to predict end-of-season AGB was greatest at 50 days after planting, accounting for 63% of variance across a diverse germplasm collection with modest error. Therefore, the use of high-resolution time-series imagery and spectroscopic methods can provide more accurate and efficient predictions of end-of-season AGB in diverse sorghum crops compared to traditional methods."
