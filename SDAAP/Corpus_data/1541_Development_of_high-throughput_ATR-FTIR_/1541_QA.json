        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the developed technology for the detection of brain cancer is sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of the technology is reported to be 93.2%, meaning that it correctly identifies 93.2% of patients with brain cancer. The specificity is reported to be 92.8%, indicating that it correctly identifies 92.8% of patients without brain cancer. These values demonstrate the accuracy of the technology in differentiating between cancer and control patients."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, attenuated total reflection (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for the rapid and cost-effective triage of brain cancer patients in primary care. This is based on the developed test's high sensitivity and specificity of 93.2% and 92.8% respectively. These results indicate that the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy test is able to accurately differentiate between cancer and control patients, making it a valuable tool for triaging brain cancer patients and allowing for rapid access to imaging."
