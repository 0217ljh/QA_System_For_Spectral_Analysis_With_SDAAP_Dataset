The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted ISP values and the actual ISP values in the reference dataset. \n\nThe RMSE can provide a quantitative measure of the accuracy of ISP estimation. A lower RMSE indicates a smaller average difference between the predicted and actual ISP values, suggesting higher accuracy."

        "Output": "The random forest regression (RFR)-based ISP prediction model was compared to other machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine regression (SVMR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR), in estimating ISP from Chinese GF-5 hyperspectral imagery. The comparison revealed that the RFR-based ISP model outperformed both SVMR and PLSR.\n\nThe experimental results showed that the RFR-based ISP model had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.15, and an R-2 value of 0.89. These performance metrics indicate that the RFR-based model had a good accuracy in estimating ISP.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that band 10 and band 53 of the GF-5 hyperspectral imagery made the highest contributions to the ISP modeling. This suggests that these specific bands contain important information for accurately estimating ISP.\n\nBased on the comparison with SVMR and PLSR, the RFR-based ISP model demonstrated superior performance. This indicates that the RFR approach is more effective and reliable in estimating ISP from hyperspectral imagery in the Nansi Lake Basin."

The study specifically focuses on the Nansi Lake Basin in China and evaluates the performance of the RFR-based ISP prediction model using training and validation samples. \n\nHowever, the related study does mention that the RFR-based ISP model outperforms other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine regression and partial least squares regression. This suggests that the RFR approach may have potential usability in ISP estimation from hyperspectral imagery in other regions or watersheds. \n\nTo determine the applicability of the RFR approach in other regions or watersheds, further research and evaluation would be necessary."
