        "Output": "Yes, the developed model based on Lasso regression using FTIR spectroscopy can be considered superior to traditional methods for extracting features related to degradation and estimating the mechanical residual strength of adhesively bonded joints. This is because the Lasso regression model was determined to be the most suitable among several linear regression methods for extracting features and estimating residual strength. Additionally, the model was able to identify areas where there is a loss of strength, indicating its effectiveness in evaluating the degradation of adhesives."
