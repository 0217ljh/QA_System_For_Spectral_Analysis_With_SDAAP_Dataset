        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy in the study was the average accuracy. The average accuracy for identifying sea bass fillets freshness was improved to 90.6% using the feature-selected CNN model. However, the study does not provide information on how far this metric can go beyond the reported accuracy."
