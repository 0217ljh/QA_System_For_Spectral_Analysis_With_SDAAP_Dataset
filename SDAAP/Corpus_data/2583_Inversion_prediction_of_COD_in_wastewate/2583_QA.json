        "Output": "The metric chosen in the rapid detection method for COD index of wastewater is the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE value obtained in the evaluation of the model is 40.4489 mg/L. \n\nThe RMSE metric measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values. In this case, it indicates the average difference between the predicted COD values and the actual COD values in the wastewater samples.\n\nAs for how far this metric can go, it is important to note that lower RMSE values indicate better accuracy of the model."

        "Output": "The developed model using hyperspectral technology and machine learning has high prediction stability and strong generalization ability compared to traditional methods for COD detection in wastewater. The model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 40.4489 mg/L, a relative analysis error (RPD) of 9.37, and a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.97. These evaluation metrics indicate that the model's predictions are accurate and reliable in real-world environments. Additionally, the model is considered a green method for COD detection as it offers a complete non-contact detection scheme, reducing the need for chemical agents and simplifying the detection process."
