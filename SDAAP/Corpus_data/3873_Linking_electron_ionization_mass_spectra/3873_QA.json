        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the model's performance in predicting toxicity endpoints was the R-2 value and balanced accuracy. The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the toxicity endpoints that can be explained by the model, with a higher value indicating a better fit. The balanced accuracy measures the overall accuracy of the model in predicting both positive and negative instances, taking into account any imbalances in the dataset. "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method of linking electron ionization mass spectra (El-MS) to toxicity endpoints using machine learning offers a novel approach to predicting the toxicity of unknown chemicals. This method provides an alternative to traditional methods that rely on accurate annotation of chemical structures, which can be challenging in complex water environments or when dealing with unknown compounds.\n\nCompared to traditional methods, the proposed method has several advantages. Firstly, it overcomes the difficulty of determining the accurate structure of an unknown compound by directly linking El-MS data to toxicity endpoints. This allows for more accurate predictions without the need for detailed structural information.\n\nSecondly, the use of machine learning techniques enhances the predictive capabilities of the model. By training the model on a dataset that includes both El-MS data and toxicity endpoints, it can learn the relationship between the spectral features and chemical-induced toxicity. This enables the model to make accurate predictions for unknown chemicals based on their El-MS spectra.\n\nThe performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the prediction of 50% growth inhibition of Tetrahymena pyriformis (T. pyriformis) and liver toxicity."
