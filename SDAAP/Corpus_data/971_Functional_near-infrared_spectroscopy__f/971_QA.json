        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to distinguish healthy individuals from those with major psychiatric disorders was a combined index of Integral Value of R1 and Centroid Value of R2, which reflects time-course changes of fNIRS signal. This metric can better differentiate individuals with mood disorders from healthy controls than schizophrenia."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) shows promise as a clinically viable tool for distinguishing healthy individuals from those with major psychiatric disorders. The study included 316 patients with major psychiatric disorders (198 SCH/54 MD/64 BP) and 101 healthy controls. Using fNIRS during a Chinese language verbal fluency test, changes in oxygenated-hemoglobin were measured over the bilateral temporal and frontal lobe areas. The study found that both the integral value of frontal and centroid value of temporal showed sensitivity in classifying individuals with mental disorders from healthy controls. Additionally, using a combined index featuring both the integral value and centroid value resulted in high accuracy in differentiating psychiatric disorders from healthy controls, with an AUC of 0.913."
