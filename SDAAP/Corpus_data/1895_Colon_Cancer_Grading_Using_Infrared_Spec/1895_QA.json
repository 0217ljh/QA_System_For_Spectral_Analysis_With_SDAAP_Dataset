        "Output": "Yes,based on the findings of this study, FT-IR imaging can be considered a potentially superior method compared to traditional methods for grading colon cancer in biopsy samples. The study demonstrates that FT-IR imaging, which utilizes molecular information from unstained tissue, can be used to estimate tumor grade in colon cancer. The development of a deep learning classifier using IR absorption allowed for accurate grade prediction. Additionally, the validation of the results on an independent cohort of surgical resections further supports the potential of FT-IR imaging as a viable tool for determining colorectal cancer grades. Therefore, the study suggests that harnessing molecular information from FT-IR imaging, in combination with morphometry, could lead to the development of clinically relevant grade prediction models."
