        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the estimation models was the coefficient of determination (R2). The R2 values ranged from 0.009 to 0.34 for the models developed using existing indices, indicating poor prediction of SOC. However, the best spectral indices (RI and NDI) had higher R2 values of 0.60, 0.61, and 0.39, 0.43 for the calibration and validation datasets, respectively. This suggests that the chosen metric, R2, can provide some level of prediction for SOC, but the models may still have limitations in accurately estimating SOC content."

        "Output": "In the past study, PLSR scores were used as a substitute for raw spectral reflectance to enhance computation and model efficiency in estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) using visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS). The PLSR scores were employed to reduce the number of input variables while retaining the maximum information present in the original data. By using PLSR scores, the researchers aimed to increase the efficiency of the computation process and improve the performance of the model."
