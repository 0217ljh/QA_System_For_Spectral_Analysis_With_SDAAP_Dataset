        "Output": "Yes, the use of remote sensing technologies and machine learning classifiers can outperform traditional industry standards for PVY detection in potato plants. The related study demonstrates that these technologies can differentiate between PVY-infected and non-infected plants with an accuracy of 89.8% using near infrared and shortwave infrared wavelengths. In comparison, the industry's current visual detection methods using red, green, and blue wavelengths only achieved a classification accuracy of 46.9%. This research suggests that remote sensing and machine learning classifiers have the potential to greatly enhance PVY detection efforts and improve the quality of potato seed stock, leading to higher yields."
