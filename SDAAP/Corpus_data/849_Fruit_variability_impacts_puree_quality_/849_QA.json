        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, spectroscopic methods can be considered superior to traditional methods in predicting the quality parameters of cooked purees based on the correlations between raw and cooked apples' VIS-NIR spectra. The study found strong correlations between the visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectra of fresh and cooked apples, particularly in specific wavelength regions. These correlations allowed for the indirect prediction of various quality parameters of the purees, such as color, viscosity, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, and pH. The use of spectroscopic methods provides a non-destructive and efficient way to predict the quality parameters of cooked purees, making it a potentially superior alternative to traditional methods."
