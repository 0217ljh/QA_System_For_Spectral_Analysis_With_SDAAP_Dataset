        "Output": "In the study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was utilized to enhance the interpretability of viable and non-viable seeds and predict seed viability. The CNN was constructed to recognize the differences between viable and non-viable seeds and classify them automatically. \n\nTo achieve this, near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) data of the seed samples were collected using an NIR-HSI camera. The NIR-HSI camera can capture both molecular vibration information and the spatial distribution of each seed sample, providing more informative data compared to a regular RGB digital camera.\n\nThe NIR-HSI data was then processed using principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) viability classification analysis. This methodology helped enhance the interpretability of viable and non-viable seeds by extracting relevant features from the NIR-HSI data.\n\nOnce the data was preprocessed and the features were extracted, the CNN was trained using the labeled data to learn the patterns and differences between viable and non-viable seeds. The trained CNN was then able to automatically classify new seed samples as viable or non-viable based on their NIR-HSI data.\n\nExperimental results showed that the CNN achieved a classification accuracy of around 90% for both a five-fold cross-validation set and a test set of naturally aged"
