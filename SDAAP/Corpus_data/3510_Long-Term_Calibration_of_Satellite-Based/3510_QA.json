        "Output": "The machine learning models were utilized in the research to develop correction approaches for improving the accuracy of the MERSI/FY-3A NIR all-weather water vapor product. These models were trained using in situ precipitable water vapor (PWV) estimates acquired from 100 global positioning system (GPS) stations in China from 2010 to 2017. The models considered multiple influence factors such as MERSI/FY-3A NIR PWV, latitude, longitude, month, and cloud. By comparing the trained models with PWV data from 114 other GPS stations in China during the same period, the research found that the machine learning models notably enhanced the long-term performance of the MERSI/FY-3A NIR water vapor observations under all-weather conditions. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was reduced by 57.62% to 71.61% compared to the original product. The calibrated MERSI NIR PWV, calculated using the machine learning models, performed better than the conventional multiple-parameter quadratic (MPQ) regression method."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the developed machine learning models can be used to improve the accuracy of other satellite-observed NIR PWV products. The related study only mentions that the calibrated MERSI NIR PWV, calculated using machine learning models, performs better than the conventional MPQ-estimated PWV. However, it does not mention whether these models can be applied to other satellite-observed NIR PWV products. Therefore, it is unclear whether the developed machine learning models can be used to improve the accuracy of other satellite-observed NIR PWV products to make them comparable to the MERSI/FY-3A NIR all-weather water vapor product."
