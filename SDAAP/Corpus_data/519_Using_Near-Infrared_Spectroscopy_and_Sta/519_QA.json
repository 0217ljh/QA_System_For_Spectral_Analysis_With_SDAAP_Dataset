        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The stacked regression ensemble approach using near-infrared spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional partial least squares for determining the chemical composition of animal manure. The related study found that the stacked regression approach performed optimally well in predicting the chemical constituents in the testing set. This suggests that it may provide a more accurate and simultaneous method for determining the chemical properties of animal manure compared to the traditional partial least squares method."
