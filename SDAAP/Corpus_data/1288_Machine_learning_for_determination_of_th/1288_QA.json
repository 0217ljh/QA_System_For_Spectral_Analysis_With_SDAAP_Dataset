        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction models was the mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The mean squared error measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, while the coefficient of determination measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n\nIn terms of improvement, the metric can go up to a 5-11% increase in accuracy (in terms of R-2) for the prediction of the native signal amplitude. This means that the machine learning methods used in the study provided a minor but noticeable improvement in the accuracy of predicting the intensity of the native signal amplitude."

        "Output": "The application of machine learning methods in in vivo tooth dosimetry using EPR spectroscopy has been shown to provide a minor but non-negligible improvement to the accuracy of native signal amplitude prediction. In the related study, various machine learning regressors were employed to develop predictive models for determining the intensity of the native signal amplitude. The performance of these models was evaluated using mean squared error and coefficient of determination.\n\nComparing the performance of all established prediction models, it was found that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting had the most superior performance. These machine learning algorithms outperformed other methods in terms of accurately predicting the native signal amplitude.\n\nOverall, the application of machine learning methods resulted in a 5-11% improvement in terms of R-2 (coefficient of determination), indicating a better accuracy in predicting the native signal amplitude compared to traditional methods. This suggests that machine learning approaches can be beneficial in improving the accuracy of in vivo tooth dosimetry using EPR spectroscopy."
