        "Output": "Yes, the weighted fusion of membership matrix can be considered as an efficient and intelligent method for achieving effective recycling of construction and demolition waste (C&DW). The paper states that the fusion of the four methods resulted in a significant improvement in the correct rate of classification, reaching 95% in repeated experiments. This indicates that the weighted fusion approach effectively combines the strengths of each individual method, overcoming their inadequacies and producing more accurate classification results. With such high accuracy, the classification results can be used in further studies for automatic sorting of C&DW using robotics instead of relying on manual labor. Therefore, the weighted fusion of membership matrix can be seen as an effective and intelligent method for achieving effective recycling of C&DW."
