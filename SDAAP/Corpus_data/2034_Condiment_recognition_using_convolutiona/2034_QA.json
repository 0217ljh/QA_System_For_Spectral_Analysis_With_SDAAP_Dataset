        "Output": "The modifications made to the ResNet18 model to create the CondimentNet algorithm for accurately identifying different food materials with similar appearance but different efficacy are as follows:\n\n1) Introduction of an appropriate number of scSE (Squeeze-and-Excitation) attention modules: These modules help the network to focus on important features and enhance the discriminative power of the model.\n\n2) Modification of the size of the convolution kernel in the last residual module: This modification helps to capture more detailed information and improve the model's ability to differentiate between similar food materials.\n\n3) Modification of the classifier structure: The classifier structure is adjusted to better suit the task of identifying different food materials. This modification helps in improving the accuracy of the network's recognition.\n\nThese modifications collectively improve the recognition accuracy of the network without significantly increasing the training cost. The experimental results showed that the improved CondimentNet algorithm achieved a recognition accuracy of 95.71%, which is 1.11% higher than the original ResNet18 network."
