        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized in the development of the multivariate calibration model for measuring total gaseous carbon using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) by incorporating physicochemical principles and training the model on a dataset containing various variables that may interfere with quantification. The machine learning model learns the relationships between these variables and the total gaseous carbon concentration, allowing it to make accurate predictions. By using machine learning, the model is able to significantly reduce the limit of detection (LOD) and the average relative standard deviation (RSD) compared to traditional models, improving the precision and accuracy of the measurement."
