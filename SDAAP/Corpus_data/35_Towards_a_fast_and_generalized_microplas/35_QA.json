        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the terahertz and NIR methods for rapid and accurate quantification of microplastics in soil is the prediction error, specifically the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE is used to measure the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the sample sets.\n\nIn terms of the detection limit, the terahertz method presented a detection limit of around 1.12%, while the NIR method showed a detection limit of around 3.24%. This means that the terahertz method is able to accurately detect microplastic concentrations as low as 1.12%, while the NIR method can detect concentrations as low as 3.24%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The terahertz method is more accurate and demonstrates stronger generalizability compared to the NIR method for quantifying microplastics in soil. When the models developed using the terahertz method were transferred to household samples, the prediction error (RMSE) only increased by 0.4% for PVC and 0.19% for PS. In contrast, the prediction error for the NIR method increased by 1.49% for PVC and 1.16% for PS when transferred to household samples. This indicates that the terahertz method provides more accurate predictions for both standard polymers and household microplastics. Additionally, the terahertz method has a lower detection limit of around 1.12%, while the NIR method has a higher detection limit of around 3.24%. Therefore, the terahertz method not only offers higher accuracy but also demonstrates stronger generalizability in bridging the gaps between standard PVC/PS polymers and household PVC/PS microplastics in soil quantification."
