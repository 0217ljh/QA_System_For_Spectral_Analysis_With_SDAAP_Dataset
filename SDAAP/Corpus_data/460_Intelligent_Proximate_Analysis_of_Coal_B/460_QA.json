        "Output": "The researchers optimized the structure of the extreme learning machine (ELM) in the coal proximate analysis using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). PSO is a computational optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. It is used to find the optimal solution by iteratively adjusting a population of potential solutions based on their fitness values.\n\nIn the past study, the researchers employed the PSO algorithm to optimize the parameters of the ELM model. The ELM model is a type of artificial neural network that has random hidden layer parameters. The random selection of these parameters can lead to poor stability and robustness of the model.\n\nBy using the PSO algorithm, the researchers were able to search for the optimal values of the hidden layer parameters in the ELM model. The PSO algorithm iteratively updates the positions and velocities of a swarm of particles in the search space. Each particle represents a potential solution, and its position corresponds to a set of parameters for the ELM model.\n\nDuring the optimization process, the fitness of each particle is evaluated based on the performance of the ELM model in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The particles adjust their positions and velocities based on their own best-known position and the best-known position of the entire swarm. This allows the"

The past study found that the proposed PSO-ELM algorithm achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This indicates that the combination of NIRS and PSO-ELM has significant potential for accurately and rapidly analyzing the moisture, volatile matter, and caloric value of coal. Compared to traditional laboratory methods, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, the PSO-ELM algorithm offers a more efficient and cost-effective alternative for coal processing and evaluation."
