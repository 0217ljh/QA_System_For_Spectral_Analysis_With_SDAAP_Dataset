        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the classification accuracy of the seed-based and pixel-based classification models for evaluating seed quality and improving agricultural productions by comparing the results obtained from different machine learning models. Specifically, they compared the accuracy of the proposed 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) model with that of the support vector machine (SVM) model. The accuracy of each model was measured in terms of seed-based classification and pixel-based classification. The results showed that the 3D CNN model had the highest accuracy, with a classification accuracy of 97.5% in seed-based classification and 94.21% in pixel-based classification. In contrast, the SVM model had a lower accuracy, with a classification accuracy of 80.0% in seed-based classification and 85.67% in pixel-based classification."

In pixel-based classification, the accuracy of the 3D CNN model is 94.21%, while the accuracy of the SVM model is 85.67%. Therefore, the 3D CNN model outperforms the SVM model in both seed-based and pixel-based classification in the HyperSeed platform for seed measurement."
