Among the tested algorithms, the artificial neural network (ANN) provided the best performance with an R value of 0.868 for MC prediction and an R value of 0.383 for pH prediction. The RMSE values were 0.756 for MC prediction and 0.044 for pH prediction."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes.Based on the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm in this study, the low-cost visible-near-infrared (VIS-NIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) tool can be considered as a superior alternative to traditional methods for predicting the moisture content (MC) of Pink Lady apples. The ANN algorithm provided a correlation (R) value of 0.868 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 0.756 for MC prediction. However, for pH prediction, the performance of the VIS-NIR HSI tool was poor, with an RMSE value of 0.044. Therefore, while the VIS-NIR HSI tool shows promise for non-destructively measuring the MC of Pink Lady apples, it may not be as effective for predicting pH."
