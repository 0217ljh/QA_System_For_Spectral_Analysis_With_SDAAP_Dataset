        "input": "",
        "Output": "The inclusion of topographic data improves the accuracy of minority classes in mountainous areas when using the PROSRUS method to address the class imbalance problem in the distribution of Land Cover (LC) classes by providing complementary information. The study found that adopting topographic data, along with time-series of Landsat-8 and SRTM topographic data, spectral indices, and other data, significantly increased the accuracy of minority classes.\n\nMountainous areas have unique topographic characteristics that can influence land cover patterns. By incorporating topographic data into the classification process, the PROSRUS method was able to capture the specific characteristics of the minority classes in these areas. This allowed for a more accurate representation of the land cover distribution, particularly for the minority classes.\n\nThe study observed that the inclusion of topographic data, in combination with the PROSRUS method, resulted in better performance compared to other balancing methods. The accuracy of the minority classes was increased without a reduction in the overall classification accuracy. This suggests that the topographic data provided valuable information that helped to address the class imbalance problem and improve the classification of minority classes in mountainous areas."
