        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed framework and scheme using multi-source remote sensing data and an automated ensemble learning method outperformed traditional methods in accurately depicting the distribution and pattern of forest cover in the Qilian Mountains. The overall accuracy of the obtained level-1 and level-2 forest-cover maps reached 95.49% and 78.05%, respectively, indicating a high level of accuracy in mapping forest cover. \n\nThe multi-classifier comparison revealed that the ensemble learning method performed better than base classifiers such as LightGBM, random forests, CatBoost, XGBoost, and neural networks for forest classification. This suggests that the combination of multiple classifiers in the ensemble learning method improved the accuracy of forest cover mapping.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of multi-dimensional features, including spectral, phenological, topographic, and geographic information, helped distinguish forest cover. This indicates that incorporating various data sources and characteristics enhanced the ability to accurately identify and map forest cover in the Qilian Mountains.\n\nCompared to other land-cover products, the mapping results using the proposed framework and scheme demonstrated high quality and rich spatial details. This implies that the use of multi-source remote sensing data and the automated ensemble learning method provided more precise and detailed information about the distribution and pattern of forest cover in the Qilian Mountains."
