        "input": "",
        "Output": "Based on the findings of the related study, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with machine learning can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for monitoring the stability of tomato fruit during storage. The study demonstrated that support vector machines using absorbance spectra obtained from NIR spectroscopy were able to accurately predict the storage conditions and time-after-harvest of tomatoes. Additionally, molecular biomarkers were identified, highlighting key wavelength and molecular changes due to time and storage conditions. This suggests that NIR spectroscopy combined with machine learning has the potential to be a more efficient and effective approach for monitoring tomato fruit stability during storage compared to traditional methods."
