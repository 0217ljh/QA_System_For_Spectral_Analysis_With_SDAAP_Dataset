        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, imaging spectroscopy-based physiological traits can accurately predict grain protein content (GPC) in wheat, as demonstrated in the study. The study used airborne hyperspectral and thermal sensors to acquire imagery with high spatial resolutions. Various physiological traits, such as Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), reflectance indices, and inverted biochemical constituents, were retrieved from the imagery. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) related to xanthophyll pigments was consistently associated with GPC at both leaf and canopy scale. Additionally, a gradient boosted machine learning algorithm (GBM) ranked CWSI as the strongest indicator of GPC under severe water stress conditions. The study achieved statistically significant results in estimating GPC in unseen samples, with a strong relationship between predicted and observed GPC. Therefore, using imaging spectroscopy-based physiological traits has the potential to reduce nitrogen losses and improve profit in wheat production."
