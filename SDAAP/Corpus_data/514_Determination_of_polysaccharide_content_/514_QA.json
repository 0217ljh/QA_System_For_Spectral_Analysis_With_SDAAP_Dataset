        "Output": "The metric chosen in the past study was the determination coefficient (Rp2), which is a measure of the prediction performance of the models. The past study found that almost all linear and non-linear models had satisfying prediction performance with Rp2 values greater than 0.95. The best performing model, SG-VS-BPNN, had an Rp2 value greater than 0.98. Therefore, the chosen metric of Rp2 was able to accurately assess the prediction performance of the models in quantifying polysaccharide content in beverages."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and machine learning methods outperforms traditional methods in quantitatively determining polysaccharide content in shiitake mushroom beverages. The comprehensive comparative analysis conducted in the past study showed that different combinations of spectral pretreatment, variable selection, and modeling methods led to different prediction performances. However, almost all linear and non-linear models, except for XGBoost, demonstrated satisfying prediction performance with Rp2 (coefficient of determination) values greater than 0.95. The SG-VS-BPNN (Savitzky-Golay spectral pretreatment, variable selection using back propagation neural network, and multivariate analysis using back propagation neural network) models exhibited the best performance with Rp2 values exceeding 0.98. This indicates that the combination of NIR spectroscopy and machine learning methods, specifically the SG-VS-BPNN approach, provides an intelligent, nondestructive, and rapid quantitation of polysaccharide content in shiitake mushroom beverages."
