According to the text, the method utilizes ground measured spectral reflectance data collected from coal, gangue, and other objects in the Shenhua Baori Xile coal mine. By removing interference information from satellite images and establishing a relationship with the ground measured data, a classification model is built using a tree root algorithm and extreme learning machine. This model is then applied to remote sensing images, resulting in a good extraction effect. \n\nCompared to typical monitoring methods, the proposed method offers several advantages. It has high precision, meaning it can accurately monitor changes in the coal mine area. Additionally, it is low-priced, suggesting that it is a cost-effective solution for monitoring. Lastly, the method is fast, implying that it can provide real-time monitoring of the coal mining area. These superiorities make the proposed method a favorable option for monitoring coal mining areas in terms of precision, cost, and speed."
