This metric measures the differences in dielectric properties at the terahertz band between unoxidized and oxidized coals. By analyzing this spectrum, the researchers were able to classify coals based on their oxidation degree.\n\nThe study found that the best classification result, with an accuracy of 87.50% in the prediction set, was achieved using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) method based on Gaussian kernel function combined with the low-frequency (75-110 GHz) terahertz spectrum of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. This metric, combined with machine learning algorithms, proved to be a promising technique for monitoring coal spontaneous combustion with high efficiency."

The researchers used logistic regression analysis (LRA), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF) models to classify coals based on their oxidation degree.\n\nThe results of the study showed that there are differences in the terahertz dielectric properties between oxidized and unoxidized coals. The best classification result was achieved using the SVM method with a Gaussian kernel function combined with the low-frequency (75-110 GHz) terahertz spectrum of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant. This method achieved an accuracy of 87.50% in the prediction set.\n\nCompared to traditional methods of preventing coal spontaneous combustion, this method offers several advantages. Firstly, it is a non-contact and real-time technique, allowing for fast discrimination of oxidized coal. Traditional methods often involve manual sampling and laboratory analysis, which can be time-consuming and may not provide real-time information.\n\nSecondly, the terahertz dielectric property measurement system combined with machine learning algorithms provides a more efficient and accurate way of monitoring coal spontaneous combustion.
