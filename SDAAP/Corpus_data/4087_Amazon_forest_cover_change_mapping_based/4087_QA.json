        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the U-Net architecture in mapping forest cover and identifying deforestation polygons in multi-temporal satellite imagery is superior to spectroscopic methods. The study found that the U-Net architecture achieved high accuracy (0.9470), precision (0.9356), recall (0.9676), and F1-score (0.9513) in identifying and drawing polygons of forest areas and forest fragments. These results indicate that the U-Net architecture outperforms commonly used supervised and unsupervised image classification methods. Therefore, the U-Net architecture shows great potential for efficient forest cover change monitoring and the development of near real-time deforestation warning systems."
