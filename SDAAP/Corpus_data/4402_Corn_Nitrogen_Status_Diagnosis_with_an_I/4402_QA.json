        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models, specifically simple regression (SR) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were used in the evaluation of the multi-parameter Crop Circle Phenom sensing system for corn N status diagnosis. The sensor-derived indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), estimated canopy chlorophyll content (eCCC), estimated leaf area index (eLAI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCI), fractional photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), and canopy and air temperature difference (Delta Temp), were used as inputs for the models. \n\nThe evaluation focused on four plant metrics used to approximate in-season N status: aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N concentration (PNC), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI). The SR modeling using NDVI was found to be sufficient for estimating AGB. On the other hand, PNC, PNU, and NNI benefitted from XGB modeling based on multiple inputs. \n\nAdditionally, the models were evaluated by combining management information, such as soil drainage, tillage, and pre-plant N (PPN) rate, with the Crop Circle Phenom measurements."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Combining management information and Crop Circle Phenom measurements improved the model performance for predicting plant N metrics compared to using sensing data alone in the study. The results showed that when management information, such as drainage, tillage, and pre-plant N rate, was included along with the sensor parameters, the model performance for estimating plant N concentration (PNC), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI) was enhanced. This suggests that incorporating management practices into the model allowed for a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of the corn N status. Additionally, the study found that pre-plant N rate was the most important management metric for all models compared to drainage and tillage information, indicating its significant influence on the prediction of plant N metrics."
