        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models' performance in the related study was the root mean square error (RMSE). The BRNN model had an RMSE of 4.686 m, indicating that, on average, the predicted canopy height values deviated from the actual values by approximately 4.686 meters. This suggests that the BRNN model performed reasonably well in estimating canopy height in the mixed tropical forests of Shoolpaneshwar wildlife sanctuary."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the use of machine learning models with multi-spectral optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, along with spaceborne LiDAR data, can be considered superior to traditional methods for mapping forest canopy height in the mixed tropical forests of Shoolpaneshwar wildlife sanctuary (SWLS), Gujarat, India. The study incorporated a continuous coverage of these data sources in the machine learning models, which resulted in satisfactory accuracy metrics for mapping canopy height. The comparison of different machine learning models showed that the Bayesian regularization for feed-forward neural networks (BRNN) model had the highest accuracy metrics. Additionally, field validation showed satisfactory results for mixed tropical forests using spaceborne LiDAR. Therefore, the use of these advanced technologies and techniques can provide valuable insights and improve the mapping of forest canopy height in SWLS and potentially in other similar environments."
