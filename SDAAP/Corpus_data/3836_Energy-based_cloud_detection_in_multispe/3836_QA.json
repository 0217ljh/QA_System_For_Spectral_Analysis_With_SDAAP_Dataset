        "Output": "The energy characteristics of Gabor texture were used in the cloud detection method for high-resolution multispectral images by first dividing the satellite remote-sensing image into superpixels using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC). Then, the energy characteristics of Gabor texture and spectral characteristics were computed by extracting the texture features of the superpixels. The features of the cloud superpixels were used as the learning sample of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and a classification model was obtained by training the SVM classifier. This approach allowed for the detection of clouds in the high-resolution multispectral images."
