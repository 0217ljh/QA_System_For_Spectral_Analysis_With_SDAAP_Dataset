        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the proposed framework for Surface Water Body Extraction (SWBE), machine learning algorithms and spectral indices were used in two steps to analyze the surface water dynamics of specific reservoirs over a four-year period.\n\nStep 1: Use of spectral indices and Gabor filters for obtaining Pixel Level Feature (PLF) maps from the multispectral image.\nIn this step, spectral indices and Gabor filters were applied to the multispectral image to extract relevant features related to surface water. Spectral indices are mathematical calculations that utilize the different bands of the multispectral image to highlight specific characteristics, such as water content. Gabor filters, on the other hand, are used to enhance texture and edge information in the image. By combining these techniques, Pixel Level Feature (PLF) maps were generated, which provide detailed information about the presence of water and non-water pixels in the image.\n\nStep 2: Prediction of water and non-water pixels based on PLF maps using machine learning classifiers.\nIn this step, the PLF maps obtained from step 1 were used as input data for various machine learning classifiers."
