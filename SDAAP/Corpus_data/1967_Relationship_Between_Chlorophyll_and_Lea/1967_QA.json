        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the estimation models of leaf SPAD was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (leaf SPAD) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral characteristics), with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values of leaf SPAD, with a lower value indicating a better fit of the model. The best result can reach R2=0.8823 and RMSE=1.6388."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral characteristics of Phyllostachys pubescens leaves, including VOG(2), R-515/R-570, CIred, PRI, and NDVI705, can be used as reliable indicators to estimate leaf SPAD and assess pest damage under the stress of Pantana phyllostachysae. The study found that these spectral characteristics showed significant changes in response to pest damage, such as the disappearance of the green peak and red valley, a decrease in the slope of the red edge, and a decrease in the reflectance of near infrared wavelength. The best estimation model for leaf SPAD based on these spectral characteristics was the multiple linear regression model, which showed good accuracy in estimating the SPAD of healthy and young leaves."
