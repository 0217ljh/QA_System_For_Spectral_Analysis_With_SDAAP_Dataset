        "Output": "The RDA factors used in the related study contribute to the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of authenticating extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) compared to traditional methods by providing a more reliable and rapid analysis technique. Unlike classical techniques such as chromatography, which require derivatization of the sample and proper integration of separated peaks, RDA factors derived from near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy do not require these additional steps. This simplifies the authentication process and reduces the time and cost associated with sample preparation and analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the use of RDA factors in models for authentication allows for the effective summarization of high-dimensional NIR spectral information. This means that a smaller number of variables can be used to represent the complex spectral data, reducing the computational burden and improving the efficiency of the analysis.\n\nBy incorporating RDA factors into machine learning algorithms, the prediction and classification of EVOO and other vegetable oils can be achieved with high accuracy. This enables the detection of fraudulent practices, such as the blending of EVOO with other oils, and ensures the authenticity of the product.\n\nOverall, the use of RDA factors in this study enhances the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of authenticating EVOO by providing a more efficient and reliable analysis technique, reducing the need for complex"
