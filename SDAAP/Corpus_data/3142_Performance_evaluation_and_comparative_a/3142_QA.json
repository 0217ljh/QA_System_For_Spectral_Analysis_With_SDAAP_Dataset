The related study suggests that the new road extraction index (NREI) and new building extraction index (NBEI), along with the matched filter (MF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, produce the best results for the extraction of road and roof surfaces. Additionally, the comparison of various algorithms indicates that the proposed indices, MF, and SVM perform well for extraction in different sensor imagery. Therefore, the proposed spectral indices and algorithms offer improved performance compared to traditional methods for extracting road and roof surfaces in urban areas in India."
