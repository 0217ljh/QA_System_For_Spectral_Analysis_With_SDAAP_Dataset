        "Output": "Yes, the proposed in-field empirical line correction method and continuous irradiance correction can be used to achieve a coherent reflectance dataset from different camera systems in the research investigating reflectance retrieved from Sentinel-2 and two airborne camera systems. The study found that significant differences in uncorrected reflectance from the two airborne sensors were reduced to a median discrepancy below 10% using the in-field empirical line correction method. Continuous irradiance correction further improved the agreement across the validation targets and achieved a coherent reflectance dataset from all four different sensor systems, including the satellite, ground, and airborne levels."
