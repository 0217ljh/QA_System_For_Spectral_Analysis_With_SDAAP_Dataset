This information can be used to optimize the design of fluorescence spectroscopy systems for bacterial species identification.\n\nFurthermore, the study demonstrates that measuring only a few wavelengths within this optimum range is sufficient to achieve accurate diagnosis of bacterial species. This finding is significant as it suggests that the diagnostic accuracy can be maintained while reducing the number of excitation wavelengths required for measurement. This reduction in the number of wavelengths simplifies the measurement process and potentially reduces the cost and time required for bacterial species identification.\n\nOverall, the study's findings provide valuable insights into the selection of excitation wavelengths for spectroscopic measurement of bacterial autofluorescence, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in bacterial species identification using fluorescence spectroscopy."
