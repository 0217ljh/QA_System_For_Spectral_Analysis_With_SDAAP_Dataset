The overall accuracy of the proposed method was up to 90 percent for ZY-3 and GF-1 images. This metric measures the percentage of correctly classified clouds compared to the total number of clouds in the satellite imagery. The proposed method achieved a 6.8 percent improvement over traditional spectral-based methods in terms of overall accuracy."

        "Output": "The role of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in the cloud detection method based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and object-based machine learning is to classify the superpixels into cloud and non-cloud regions. After extracting the feature vectors for each superpixel using the PLSA model, the SVM algorithm is applied at the superpixel level to determine whether a superpixel belongs to the cloud or non-cloud class. This classification process helps in creating a cloud mask, which is then used in the subsequent step of the cloud detection method."

        "Output": "The proposed cloud detection method based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and object-based machine learning outperforms traditional spectral-based methods in terms of accuracy. The overall accuracy of the proposed method was up to 90 percent for ZY-3 and GF-1 images, which is about a 6.8 percent improvement over the traditional spectral-based methods. This indicates that the proposed method is more effective in accurately detecting clouds using the multispectral information of the available four bands.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, the related study does not provide specific information about the efficiency of the proposed method compared to traditional spectral-based methods."
