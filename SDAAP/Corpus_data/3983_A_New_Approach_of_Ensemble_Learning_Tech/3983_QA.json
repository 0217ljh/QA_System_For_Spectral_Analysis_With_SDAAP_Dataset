The study utilized the FDS system, which integrated learning concepts and probability models, to classify different types of image data. The FDS system employed Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN) approaches, along with the Fuzzy Dempster-Shafer (FDS) analysis, to upgrade various models and improve the accuracy of the classification. The overall classification accuracy achieved using the FDS system was 97.27%, with a kappa value of 0.93. This indicates that the FDS system, with its spectral feature processing methods, outperformed traditional methods in accurately classifying paddy rice images."
