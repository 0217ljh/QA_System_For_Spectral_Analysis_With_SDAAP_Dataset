        "Output": "The study's findings support the use of LIBS combined with chemometric methods in determining the quality indexes of biomass pellets by demonstrating the effectiveness and accuracy of this approach. The study measured and analyzed the gross calorific value, ash content, volatile matter, and fixed carbon of biomass pellet samples using LIBS spectroscopy. The results showed that the quantitative analysis models built using chemometric methods, such as partial least-squares regression (PLSR), least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM), and extreme learning machines (ELM), performed well in predicting the quality indexes of biomass pellets. \n\nSpecifically, the LS-SVM model obtained the best determination results, with all R(2) values over 0.95, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values of the quality indexes. Additionally, the modeling performance of ash was slightly better than that of the other three quality indexes, further confirming the feasibility of using relevant elements to predict biomass quality indexes.\n\nThese findings suggest that LIBS coupled with suitable chemometrics can be a promising alternative method for determining the quality indexes of biomass pellets. This approach can help improve energy utilization by selecting biomass materials with better quality, ultimately promoting the use of biomass pellets as a renewable and clean energy source."
