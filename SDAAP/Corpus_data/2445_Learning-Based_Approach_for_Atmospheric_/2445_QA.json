This approach utilizes a parametric regressor whose parameters are learned through a strategy based on synthetic data. The synthetic data takes into account various factors such as the radiative transfer in the atmosphere, the variability of the surface spectral reflectance, and the effects of signal-dependent random noise and spectral miscalibration errors. By training the regressor with this synthetic data, it is able to compensate for the water absorption and provide the spectral reflectance for each pixel in the analyzed image."
