        "Output": "he study found that vis-NIR spectroscopy is suitable for assessing humus conditions in Saxon forests, including both mineral and organic horizons. In the organic Oh horizons, the prediction results for C and N content achieved R-2 values between 0.44 and 0.58, with corresponding RPIQ values ranging from 1.58 to 2.06 depending on the algorithm used. Estimations of C/N ratio were more precise with R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 2.16. The best results were reported for pH value, with R-2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.20. In mineral topsoil, the models for C and N content achieved higher R-2 values of 0.59 to 0.72, with RPIQ values between 2.22 and 2.54. However, prediction accuracy was lower for C/N ratio (R-2 = 0.50, RMSE = 3.52) and pH values (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.29). Models for CEC achieved R-2 = 0.65, with RPIQ = 2.81. The study also demonstrated the potential for classifying pH classes for humus mapping, with balanced accuracy."

The study evaluates the potential of vis-NIRS for estimating soil parameters in both organic (Oh) and mineral (0-5 cm, Ah) horizons.
