These deep features are obtained using the DBN model and are then used to establish a support vector regression (SVR) model. By incorporating these high-dimensional deep features into the SVR model, the prediction accuracy of the model is significantly improved.\n\nIn the past study, the researchers collected near-infrared spectroscopy and actual blood glucose concentration values for specific wavelengths. They used the standard oral glucose tolerance test to collect this data. The DBN model was then used to extract high-dimensional deep features from the non-invasive blood glucose spectrum. These deep features were then utilized in the SVR model to predict blood glucose concentrations.\n\nThe results of the past study showed that when the DBN-based high-dimensional deep features were used in the SVR model, the root mean square error of the model was reduced by 71.67%. Additionally, the correlation coefficient (R (2)) and the P value of the Clark grid analysis (P) were increased by 13.99% and 6.28%, respectively. This indicates that the proposed method"
