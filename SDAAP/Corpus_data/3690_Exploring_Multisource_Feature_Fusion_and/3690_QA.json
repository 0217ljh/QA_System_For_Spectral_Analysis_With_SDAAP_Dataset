        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the estimation accuracy of chlorophyll content in this study is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the relative root mean square error (rRMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the chlorophyll content that can be explained by the model, with a higher value indicating a better fit. The rRMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual chlorophyll content values, expressed as a percentage of the mean chlorophyll content. \n\nThese metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of the chlorophyll content estimation models."

        "Output": "The study on estimating crop chlorophyll content using UAV remote sensing technology utilized four machine learning algorithms. These algorithms were ridge regression (RR), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), random forest regression (RFR), and stacking ensemble learning. The accuracy of these algorithms was compared in terms of estimation accuracy. The study found that the stacking ensemble learning algorithm outperformed the traditional machine learning algorithms in terms of chlorophyll content estimation accuracy, especially when combined with multisource feature fusion. The multisource feature fusion approach also achieved higher estimation accuracy compared to the single-feature method. The estimation results were measured using R-2 values ranging from 0.699 to 0.754 and rRMSE values ranging from 8.36% to 9.47%."
