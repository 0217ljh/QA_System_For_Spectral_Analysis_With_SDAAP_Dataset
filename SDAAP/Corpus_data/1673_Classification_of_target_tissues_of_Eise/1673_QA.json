        "Output": "The metric chosen for data analysis in the sequential workflow is the random decision forest (RDF) classification. This metric enables the rapid identification of target tissues, such as digestive tissue, which are relevant from an ecotoxicological point of view. However, the text does not provide information on how far this metric can go in identifying target tissues."

        "Output": "Yes, the developed sequential workflow combining Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional histochemical tissue analysis methods in terms of speed and reproducibility. The text states that the workflow enables rapid identification of target tissues and provides specific lipid species sensitive to metabolic changes and environmental stressors. This suggests that the workflow allows for faster tissue characterization and provides more comprehensive information on ecotoxicological effects at the tissue level. Additionally, the text mentions that the approach is fast and reproducible, indicating that it can be consistently applied to obtain reliable results."
