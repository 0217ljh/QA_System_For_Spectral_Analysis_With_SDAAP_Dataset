        "Output": "The metric used to identify the geographical origin of Chinese tomatoes was correct classification rate (CCR). The principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were conducted on the raw spectra to identify the geographical origin of the tomatoes. Additionally, six algorithms (grid search, genetic algorithm, particle swarm algorithm, grey wolf algorithm, improved grey wolf algorithm, and sparrow search algorithm) were employed to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM). The optimal PLS-DA model achieved a correct classification rate (CCR) of 97.8% in an external prediction set. Furthermore, the SAE-SSA-SVM simplified model showed the best performance with a CCR of 98.7%, 95.6%, and 95.6% in the calibration, cross-validation, and prediction set, respectively."

The ralted study found that principal component analysis (PCA) on the raw spectra effectively identified the origin of the tomatoes. Additionally, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) combined with different preprocessing methods showed that the PLS-DA model based on the raw spectra achieved the best performance, with a correct classification rate (CCR) of 97.8% in an external prediction set. \n\nFurthermore, the ralted study employed six different algorithms to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM), and the sparrow search algorithm (SSA)-SVM model exhibited the best performance with a CCR of 97.8% in the prediction set. \n\nMoreover, the ralted study extracted spectral features using stacked autoencoder (SAE) and principal component loading, and the qualitative analysis model based on these features showed even better performance. The SAE-SSA-SVM simplified model achieved a CCR of 98.7%, 95.6%, and 95.6% in the calibration, cross-validation, and prediction set, respectively."
