        "input": "",
        "Output": "The past study evaluated the performance of the machine learning models used for predicting SOC and TN in peatland ecosystems by comparing the results obtained from three different spectral pre-processing techniques: Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), and Cubist algorithms. The researchers applied these techniques to the soil and spectral datasets retrieved from the Land Use/Cover Area frame Statistical Survey, which included 21,771 observations at 0-20 cm depth and 63 soil cores in a degraded peatland in Germany with 262 observations up to 2 m depth.\n\nTo determine the best pre-processing technique, the past study considered the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by each algorithm. The researchers found that applying Savitzky-Golay smoothing with a window size of 71 points, 2nd order polynomial, and zero derivative with the Cubist algorithm yielded the best results for both SOC and TN predictions.\n\nBy comparing the performance of the different machine learning models and pre-processing techniques, the past study was able to identify the most effective approach for quantifying SOC and TN in peatland ecosystems."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIR) can be considered superior to traditional methods for quantifying soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in peatlands ecosystems. This is because VNIR spectroscopy is described as an inexpensive, quick, non-evasive, proximal sensing, and low-cost analysis technique that can be employed in the field and/or laboratory. Therefore, the use of VNIR spectroscopy is presented as a more efficient and effective approach for quantifying SOC and TN in peatlands ecosystems."
