        "Output": "Yes, the established models using spectroscopic methods can be considered more robust and accurate compared to traditional methods for non-destructive detection of moisture in withering leaves. The study mentioned in the text aimed to establish more robust and accurate models for moisture analysis in withering leaves. The performance of front side, back side, and multi-region models was compared, and it was found that the front side model showed the worst transferability. To improve the accuracy of the front side model, five effective wavelength (EW) selection algorithms were combined with a successive projection algorithm (SPA) to select the most relevant EWs. The shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) combined with SPA was identified as the best method for the front side model. Additionally, the extreme learning machine (ELM) was found to be the model with the best self-verification result based on the selected EWs. These findings suggest that the established models using spectroscopic methods, such as EW selection algorithms and ELM, provide more accurate and robust results for non-destructive detection of moisture in withering leaves compared to traditional methods."
