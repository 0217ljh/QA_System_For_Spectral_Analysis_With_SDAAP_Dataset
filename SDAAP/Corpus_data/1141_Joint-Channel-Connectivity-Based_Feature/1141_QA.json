However, it does state that the accuracy of the proposed method is 0.961, which indicates that accuracy was likely used as the metric to evaluate the classification performance. The text does not provide information on how far this metric can go in terms of accuracy beyond the mentioned value of 0.961."

The experimental results showed that the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 0.961, which is higher than other machine learning methods. This indicates that the algorithm outperformed traditional methods in accurately detecting stress. Therefore, based on the experimental results and comparison with other machine learning methods, the proposed algorithm using fNIRS can be considered superior for detecting stress in decision-making situations."
