These algorithms were applied to the Sentinel-2 multi-year composite water and vegetation indices data from 2016 to 2020.\n\nThe study used the object-based approach, where the algorithms were trained to classify different land cover classes within the wetlands. The spectral separability of these land cover classes was assessed using the Sentinel-2 data. The algorithms were then applied to accurately detect and map the wetlands based on their spectral characteristics.\n\nThe results of the study showed that all the algorithms, except for the Naive Bayes method, demonstrated superiority in mapping the wetlands with acceptable accuracy. The Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Classification and Regression Tree algorithms were found to be the most suitable for accurately characterizing small and seasonal semi-arid wetlands.\n\nOverall, the study highlighted the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine platform, Sentinel-2 data, and advanced machine learning algorithms in accurately detecting and mapping wetlands in semi-arid environments."
