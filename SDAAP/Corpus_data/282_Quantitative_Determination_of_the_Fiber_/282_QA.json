        "Output": "The use of extreme learning machine (ELM) in combination with near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and variable selection contributes to the rapid and green determination of four components in blended fabrics compared to traditional wet chemical analysis methods in several ways.\n\nFirstly, ELM is a machine learning algorithm that can efficiently handle large datasets and complex relationships between variables. By utilizing ELM, the multivariate calibration process becomes more accurate and efficient, leading to improved prediction models for the textile components.\n\nSecondly, NIR spectroscopy is a non-destructive and non-invasive analytical technique that can quickly analyze samples without the need for extensive sample preparation. This eliminates the need for laborious and time-consuming wet chemical analysis methods, which often require the use of hazardous chemicals and generate waste.\n\nAdditionally, the combination of NIR spectroscopy with variable selection techniques allows for the identification and selection of the most relevant variables or wavelengths for the analysis. This helps to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction models.\n\nOverall, the use of ELM in combination with NIR spectroscopy and variable selection enables a rapid and green determination of the four components in blended fabrics. It eliminates the need for traditional wet chemical analysis methods, which are often laborious, time-consuming, and expensive"
