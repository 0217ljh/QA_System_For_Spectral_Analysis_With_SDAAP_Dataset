        "Output": "The goal of developing a system that rapidly acquires spectral images from biopsies and uses spectral classification algorithms was to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing cancer cells in pathological biopsies. By capturing spectral information, which is more informative than color information, the system aimed to achieve high accuracy in identifying cancer cells. The use of artificial intelligence algorithms further enhanced the performance, requiring only a small training set. The ultimate objective was to bridge the gap in machine-aided diagnostics of whole biopsies, leading to improved patient care and expedited treatment procedures."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of spectral information in the developed system can be considered superior to traditional color-based methods in identifying cancer cells. The related study states that the spectral information obtained from biopsies is remarkably more informative than color information. The system's spectral classification algorithms, combined with artificial intelligence algorithms, achieved high accuracy in identifying cancer cells. The related study also mentions that the most important spectral differences are observed in the nucleus and are related to aneuploidy in tumor cells. Therefore, the rapid spectral imaging measurement provided by the developed system can bridge the gap in machine-aided diagnostics of whole biopsies, improving patient care and expediting the treatment procedure."
