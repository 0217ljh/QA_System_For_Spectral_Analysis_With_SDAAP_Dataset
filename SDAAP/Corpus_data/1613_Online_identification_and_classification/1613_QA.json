        "Output": "Yes, the IGA-SVM model used in the online identification and classification system based on LIBS can be considered superior to traditional methods for monitoring heavy metals in agricultural products. The investigation showed that the IGA-SVM model provides better classification of navel oranges based on analysis of the LIBS spectral data, with a classification accuracy of 98%. This indicates that the IGA-SVM model is more effective in accurately detecting and classifying heavy metal contamination in agricultural products compared to traditional methods."
