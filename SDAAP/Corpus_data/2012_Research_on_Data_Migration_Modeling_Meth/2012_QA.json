        "Output": "The near-infrared spectral modeling method combining migration learning and spectral transfer calibration outperforms traditional methods in terms of modeling accuracy and efficiency for predicting larch bending strength. \n\nThe method addresses the poor generalization of the master model caused by differences in data from different types of spectrometers. By using migration learning and spectral transfer calibration, the method is able to linearly transform the spectral data from the slave instrument to match the master instrument, improving the modeling accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, the method employs the SWCSS feature extraction technique, which selects wavebands based on the differences and similarities of the two groups of spectral data sets. This ensures the effectiveness and stability of the features, further enhancing the modeling accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, the method utilizes the GFK-SVM model, which is suitable for the migration of different spectral data. It can map different types of spectral data through reasonable kernel function parameters, constructing a generalized model for different datasets. This improves the efficiency of data processing.\n\nOverall, the near-infrared spectral modeling method combining migration learning and spectral transfer calibration demonstrates higher modeling accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods for predicting larch bending strength."
