        "Output": "The overall objective of using NIR camera imaging technology combined with deep learning methods in the proposed method for detecting early bruises in apples was to develop a reliable and efficient technique for accurately identifying and distinguishing early bruised areas in apples. The aim was to overcome the limitations of conventional techniques such as manual and machine vision sorting, which struggle to detect early bruises that resemble healthy tissue. By utilizing the sensitivity of bruised tissue to NIR light, the proposed method aimed to achieve high detection accuracy and fast recognition speed, enabling real-time online detection of early bruises in apples."
