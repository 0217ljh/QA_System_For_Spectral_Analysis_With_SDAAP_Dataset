This is supported by the findings of the study, which achieved an overall prediction accuracy higher than 90% through the use of machine learning models. The study demonstrates that the classification of colon malignancy can be effectively achieved by analyzing the spectral data obtained from FTIR spectroscopic imaging. This approach allows for the identification of important differences between different stages of colon malignancy, particularly within the fingerprint region of the FTIR spectra. Additionally, the study compares two different approaches for eliminating the scattering background during measurements and shows that computational correction performed better than optical correction. Overall, the combination of FTIR spectroscopic imaging and machine learning offers a promising and accurate method for classifying different stages of colon malignancy."
