        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the different methods in this study is the overall classification accuracy (OA) and the kappa coefficient (K). The overall classification accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels in relation to the total number of pixels, while the kappa coefficient measures the agreement between the classified results and the reference data, taking into account the agreement that could occur by chance.\n\nThese metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the accuracy and reliability of the lithological mapping approaches. They indicate how well the different methods are able to classify the lithological units in the study area based on the remote sensing data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the results of the comparative study, the SVM-GEOBIA classification approach can be considered superior to the PBIA and SPBIA methods in terms of efficiency for lithological mapping in semi-arid regions with inaccessible outcrops. The SVM-GEOBIA approach achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (OA approximate to 93%) and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.89, indicating its effectiveness in accurately mapping lithological units. In contrast, the SPBIA method had an OA of approximately 89% and kappa coefficient of 0.84, while the PBIA method exhibited salt and pepper noise in the resulting lithological maps, with a lower OA of 87% and kappa coefficient of 0.80. Therefore, the SVM-GEOBIA approach is the most suitable technique for lithological mapping in such regions where outcrops are often inaccessible, making traditional cartographic work more challenging."
