        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the stepwise classification approach developed with Planet imagery can be used to overcome the spectral confusion between rice and non-rice vegetation types in mapping rice planting areas in regions with fragmented distribution of rice fields in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Plain of China, even in areas where image acquisition is limited by rainy and cloudy weather conditions. The study specifically proposed this approach and found that it achieved a high overall classification accuracy (90.42%) and kappa coefficient (0.81) in mapping rice planting areas. This approach has great value in monitoring rice paddies in regions with fragmented distribution of rice fields."
