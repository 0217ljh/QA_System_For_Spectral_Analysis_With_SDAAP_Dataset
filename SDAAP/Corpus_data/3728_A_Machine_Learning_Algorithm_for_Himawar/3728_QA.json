        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the algorithm's performance in estimating TSS concentrations in the GBR using the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite is relative errors and absolute errors. The relative errors in TSS retrievals were found to be up to 75%, indicating the percentage difference between the estimated TSS concentration and the actual TSS concentration. The absolute errors were found to be 2 mg L-1, indicating the numerical difference between the estimated TSS concentration and the actual TSS concentration. The detection limit of the algorithm was determined to be 0.25 mg L-1, which means that the algorithm can accurately estimate TSS concentrations above this threshold."

        "Output": "Yes, the developed physics-based coastal ocean colour algorithm using the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite can be considered superior to traditional methods in estimating total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Traditional methods of estimating TSS concentrations typically rely on remote sensing of ocean colour from low orbit satellites, which have limited revisit capability and cannot fully resolve diurnal variability in highly dynamic coastal environments. \n\nIn contrast, the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite offers the opportunity to estimate ocean colour features every 10 minutes, providing more frequent and timely data. The algorithm developed for Himawari-8 utilizes artificial neural network techniques and coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer simulations to estimate TSS concentrations directly from the satellite's top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance observations.\n\nThe algorithm was validated with concurrent in situ data across the coastal GBR, and its detection limits were assessed. The TSS retrievals from the algorithm showed relative errors up to 75% and absolute errors of 2 mg L-1 within the validation range of 0.14 to 24 mg L-1, with a detection limit of 0.25 mg L-1."
