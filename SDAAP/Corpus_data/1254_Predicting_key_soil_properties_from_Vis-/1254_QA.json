        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the application of simple ratio indices (SRI) and normalized difference indices (NDI) calculated from visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectra can be considered as a superior method for improving the prediction of key soil properties compared to traditional methods. According to the study mentioned in the text, the SRI and NDI transformations significantly improved the performance of all the models compared to the untransformed data. The SRI was found to be superior to NDI in terms of prediction performance. The stacked model PCR-poly applied on the SRI data yielded the best prediction performances for all the soil properties. The findings of the study suggest that using SRI and NDI transformations on Vis-NIR data, along with employing stacked models for calibration, can yield similar prediction performances for soil properties compared to deep learning-based methods, while being computationally less demanding."
