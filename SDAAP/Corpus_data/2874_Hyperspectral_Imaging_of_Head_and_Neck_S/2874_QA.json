        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for SCC detection at the cancer margin in excised tissue specimens from 102 patients is the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC). The AUC of the ROC curve is a common evaluation metric used to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test or imaging method. It measures the ability of the test to distinguish between true positive and false positive results."

        "Output": "The machine learning tools developed and used in the related study include deep learning tools for inter-patient tissue samples and machine learning for intra-patient tissue samples. These tools were used to detect SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) with new patient samples and to evaluate the performance of label-free, reflectance-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and autofluorescence imaging in detecting SCC at the cancer margin in excised tissue specimens."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, label-free, reflectance-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and autofluorescence imaging methods can be considered superior to traditional methods in accurately detecting the cancer margin in excised tissue specimens from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). According to the study, HSI classified conventional SCC with an AUC of 0.82 up to 3 mm from the cancer margin, which was more accurate than proflavin dye and autofluorescence. Intra-patient autofluorescence imaging also detected human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) SCC with an AUC of 0.99 at 3 mm and had greater accuracy than proflavin dye. The inter-patient results showed that reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging outperformed proflavin dye and standard red, green, and blue (RGB) images. Additionally, in new patients, HSI detected conventional SCC in the larynx, oropharynx, and nasal cavity with AUC scores ranging from 0.85 to 0.95, and autofluorescence imaging detected HPV+ SCC in tonsillar tissue with a 0.91 AUC score. Therefore, these label-free"
