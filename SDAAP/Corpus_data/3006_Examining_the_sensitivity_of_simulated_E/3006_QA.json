        "Output": "The related study used remote sensing hyperspectral images from the AISA Eagle airborne data, as well as simulated EnMAP scenes generated using the EnMAP end-to-end simulator software (EeteS). The spectra used in the study were derived from the red and near-infrared (NIR) regions, specifically wavelengths around 550 nm and 700 to 750 nm."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction accuracy in the study was the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC). These metrics were used to assess the accuracy of the predicted values for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended solids (TSS) based on the simulated EnMAP scenes. The R2 values obtained for Chl-a and TSS were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values. The RMSE values were 43.06 mu g/L for Chl-a and 17.53 mg/L for TSS, indicating the average difference between the predicted and actual values. The LCCC values were 0.91 for Chl-a and 0.94 for TSS, indicating a high level of agreement between the predicted and actual values. Overall, these metrics demonstrate that the simulated EnMAP scenes were able to accurately predict the water quality indicators, Chl-a and TSS."
