        "input": "",
        "Output": "The advantage of using hyperspectral imaging and deep learning in the proposed automatic mineral identification system is that it allows for the extraction and analysis of high-resolution spectral data from the visible light wavelength region to the near infrared region. This enables the system to identify and analyze the unique spectral patterns of each mineral. Compared to traditional methods that rely on visual information from the red, green, and blue (RGB) regions, the combination of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning significantly improves the accuracy of mineral identification. The experimentation results showed that the identification accuracy using deep learning on RGB images was only approximately 30%, while the accuracy using hyperspectral data analysis with deep learning was over 90%. This non-destructive method allows for faster and more efficient mineral processing by identifying the types of minerals contained in rocks in advance."
