        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers improved the robustness of the integral classification model by using two techniques: grid search and K-fold cross validation. These techniques help in optimizing the model's performance and reducing overfitting. Grid search involves systematically searching for the best combination of hyperparameters for the model. K-fold cross validation, on the other hand, involves dividing the dataset into K subsets and training the model K times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. This helps in evaluating the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data and reducing the impact of any particular subset on the results."
