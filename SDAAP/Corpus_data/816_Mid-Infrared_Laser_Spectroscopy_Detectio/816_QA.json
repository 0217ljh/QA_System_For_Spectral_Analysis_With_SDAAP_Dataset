        "Output": "Yes, the accuracy achieved by the AI strategies using a tunable quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectrometer, multivariate analysis (MVA), and artificial intelligence (AI) in distinguishing between contaminated and uncontaminated soils can be considered superior to traditional methods. The second AI strategy, which utilized a random forest model, achieved an accuracy of 0.996 in distinguishing between soils contaminated with specific explosives (DNT, TNT, or RDX) and uncontaminated soils. This high accuracy suggests that the AI strategies based on QCL spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms are effective in detecting and classifying contaminated soils, surpassing traditional methods in terms of accuracy."
