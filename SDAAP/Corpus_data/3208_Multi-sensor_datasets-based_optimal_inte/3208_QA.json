        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy in this study is the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples, while the kappa coefficient takes into account the agreement between the observed and predicted classifications, considering the possibility of agreement by chance alone.\n\nThe overall accuracy and kappa coefficient provide a quantitative measure of the performance of the Machine Learning Models (MLMs) in accurately classifying different rock types."

        "Output": "In the related study's approach for lithological classification in the Chhatarpur district of India, the researchers integrated multi-sensor datasets and machine learning models. They used the following multi-sensor datasets: Advanced Spaceborne Thermal and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), Sentinel-1, and a digital elevation model. \n\nTo classify different rock types accurately, the researchers derived and evaluated different input features. These input features included spectral data, spectral and transformed spectral data, spectral and morphological data, spectral and textural data, and optimum hybrid features. \n\nThe researchers then employed two machine learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), to perform the classification. They compared the performance of these models using different input features. \n\nThe results showed that the SVM achieved better classification accuracy and was less sensitive to the number of samples used in model development. The optimum hybrid features outperformed other input features, resulting in an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 77.78% and 0.74, respectively. This accuracy was approximately 15% higher than that obtained using ASTER spectral data alone. \n\nBased on these findings, the researchers recommended the proposed multi-sensor optimal integration"
