The related study found that the best results were obtained using only spectral bands as inputs for the machine learning algorithms. This suggests that the spectral bands provide valuable information about the physicochemical characteristics of the soybean genotypes, such as oil and protein contents in the grains. By utilizing high-throughput phenotyping technologies and machine learning algorithms, it becomes faster and more precise to obtain information about these characteristics. Therefore, the use of spectral bands as inputs in machine learning algorithms can improve the classification accuracy of soybean genotypes based on industrial traits compared to traditional methods."
