        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate the relative moisture absorption in FRP composites is the R^2 value. The R^2 value, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (moisture absorption) that can be explained by the independent variables (dielectric response). \n\nThe text states that the supervised regression models (MLR, DTR, and MLP regression) have been developed to accurately estimate the relative moisture absorption from the dielectric data, with an R^2 value greater than 0.95. This indicates that the chosen metric, R^2, can explain more than 95% of the variance in the moisture absorption based on the dielectric response of the material. Therefore, the chosen metric can go quite far in estimating the relative moisture absorption in FRP composites."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning models were used to estimate the moisture content in FRP composites under hygrothermal aging. The first step was to develop supervised classification learning models, including quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier. These models were used to categorize the composites based on the present state of the absorbed moisture.\n\nNext, supervised regression models were developed to accurately estimate the relative moisture absorption from the dielectric data. The regression models used in the related study were multiple linear regression (MLR), decision tree regression (DTR), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regression. These models were able to effectively estimate the relative moisture absorption from the dielectric response of the material, with an R\u864f value greater than 0.95.\n\nBy comparing the model attributes, the study aimed to interpret the physics behind the hygrothermal aging of the composites and identify the characteristics that most strongly influence the predictions."
