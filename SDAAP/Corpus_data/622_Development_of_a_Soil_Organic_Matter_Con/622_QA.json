        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models, specifically partial least squares regression and support vector regression, were used to predict the soil organic matter (SOM) content in the topsoil samples collected from the rivers in the Republic of Korea. The models were developed using spectroscopic techniques, where the reflection spectrum of each topsoil sample was measured three times in wavelengths ranging from 350 to 2500 nm. The performance of each model was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error. The SOM content prediction model for the total topsoil had an R-2 value of 0.706, indicating a relatively good predictability of the SOM content."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes Spectroscopic technology can be used to identify the important wavelength of soil organic matter (SOM) in topsoil and predict SOM content in the topsoil samples collected from the rivers in the Republic of Korea. In the related study, spectroscopic techniques were used to measure the reflection spectrum of the topsoil samples collected from the rivers. The researchers developed a machine learning-based SOM content prediction model using these spectroscopic measurements. The performance of the model was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error. The results showed that the model had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.706, indicating that the SOM content could be predicted using spectroscopic technology. Therefore, spectroscopic technology can be used to identify the important wavelength of SOM in topsoil and predict SOM content in the topsoil samples collected from the rivers in the Republic of Korea."
