        "Output": "Yes. Based on the results of related study, the 1D-CNN models with full spectra can be considered as a superior calibration regression strategy for water pH detection using Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The related study showed that the 1D-CNN models achieved the highest prediction accuracy compared to the conventional multivariate regression methods (PLS and LS-SVM). The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and determination coefficient of prediction (R-p(2)) values obtained by the 1D-CNN models were also higher than those obtained by the other methods. Additionally, the convolutional layers of the 1D-CNN models were able to automatically preprocess the spectra and effectively extract the spectra features, eliminating the need for complex spectra pretreatment and variable selection. Therefore, the 1D-CNN models offer higher prediction accuracy and better modeling convenience for rapid water pH detection using Vis-NIR spectroscopy."
