The new approach using the catchments' spectral signature\n2. The traditional method using physical properties\n3. A fusion of these methods\n\nThe researchers found that the calibration results were excellent, with a median Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.83. They also found that the regionalized parameters achieved good performance, with almost the same goodness of fit across the three scenarios (median KGE = 0.45-0.50). \n\nIn terms of performance in different climatic environments, the physical approach exhibited better performance (median KGE = 0.71) than the spectral approach (median KGE = 0.64) in humid catchments."

        "Output": "Yes, the related study demonstrates that the catchment's spectral signature based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data can be effectively used for the regionalization of hydrological model parameters using a machine learning approach. The authors tested the random forest algorithm in several regionalization scenarios, including the new approach using the catchments' spectral signature. The results showed that the new spectral approach achieved good performance, with a median Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.64. This approach was particularly effective in the analysis of the relationship between the spectral response of the territory and its hydrological characteristics, especially in areas where no cartographic data is available."
