        "Output": "The metric chosen to characterize Brazilian Coastal Plains (BCP) soils for predicting total nitrogen (TN), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soil organic matter (SOM)a was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the predicted values and the actual values. In this study, the R-2 values obtained for TN, CEC, and SOM were 0.50, 0.75, and 0.56, respectively. \n\nThe R-2 value provides an indication of how well the machine learning algorithms are able to explain the variability in the predicted soil properties based on the pXRF data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning algorithms were evaluated based on their performance in predicting total nitrogen (TN), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soil organic matter (SOM) using pXRF data in the study on characterizing Brazilian Coastal Plains (BCP) soils. Four machine learning algorithms were used for evaluation: ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression (CR), XGBoost (XGB), and random forest (RF). The evaluation was based on the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made by each algorithm. The RF model achieved the best performances for TN (R-2 = 0.50), CEC (0.75), and SOM (0.56) when A and B horizons were combined. However, it is noted that better results have been reported in the literature for soils from other regions of the world."
