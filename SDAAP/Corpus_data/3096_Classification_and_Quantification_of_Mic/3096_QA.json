These models were used for classification of nine of the most common polymers produced worldwide. Different data preprocessing strategies were applied to evaluate the performance of the models. PLS-DA was found to have better analytical performance compared to SIMCA models, with higher sensitivity, sensibility, and lower misclassification error. PLS-DA was also less sensitive to edge effects on spectra and poorly focused regions of particles. These machine learning models played a crucial role in accurately classifying the microplastics based on their polymer composition, contributing to the overall efficiency of the method."
