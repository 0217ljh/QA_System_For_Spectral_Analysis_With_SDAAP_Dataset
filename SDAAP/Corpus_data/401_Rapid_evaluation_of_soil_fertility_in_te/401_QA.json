        "Output": "Yes. the proposed near-infrared spectroscopy calibration models can be considered superior to traditional methods for evaluating soil fertility and managing tea plantations. The past study demonstrated that these models successfully achieved nondestructive and rapid evaluation of organic matter and total nitrogen contents, as well as the classification of soil fertility levels in tea plantation soils. The models showed high prediction correlation coefficients for organic matter and total nitrogen contents, indicating their accuracy in determining these parameters. Additionally, the classification model using the successive projections algorithm-extreme learning machine was deemed superior, with a correct classification rate of 84.38%. These findings suggest that the near-infrared spectroscopy calibration models can provide more efficient and precise soil analysis for tea plantations compared to traditional methods."
