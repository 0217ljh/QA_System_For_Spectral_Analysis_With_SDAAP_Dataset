        "input": "",
        "Output": "The advantage of using a machine-learning-based inversion model compared to traditional reconstruction methods is that the machine-learning model only requires scanning the central axis of the flame to simultaneously and efficiently reconstruct the two-dimensional temperature and CO2 concentration fields. This simplifies the measurement system and improves the reconstruction performance. Additionally, the machine-learning model requires fewer experimental measurements only in the axial direction, further reducing the complexity of the experimental setup."

        "Output": "Yes, the machine-learning-based reconstruction model using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) measurements can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of simplifying the measurement system and improving the reconstruction performance for retrieving two-dimensional temperature and CO2 concentration fields from axisymmetric laminar diffusion flames. The traditional reconstruction algorithm requires multiple line-of-sight measurements in both axial and radial directions, making the experimental system complicated and the reconstruction efficiency relatively low."
