        "Output": "Yes, neurosurgical hyperspectral imaging (HSI) using deep learning-based methods can be considered superior to established imaging techniques in terms of overall accuracy for multitissue classification. According to the provided related study, a systematic literature review found that the highest overall accuracy of 80% was achieved using deep learning for multitissue classification during glioma operations. This suggests that HSI with deep learning-based methods has the potential to outperform established imaging techniques in accurately classifying different tissues during neurosurgical procedures."
