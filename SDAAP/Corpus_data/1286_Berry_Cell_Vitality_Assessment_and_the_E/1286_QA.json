        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the ML models developed in the related research is the correlation coefficient (R) and slope (b). The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted values and the actual values. The slope represents the accuracy of the predicted values compared to the actual values.\n\nThe results of the models showed high accuracy and performance, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.99 and slopes ranging from 0.82 to 1.00. This indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the predicted and actual values, suggesting that the ML models are effective in estimating berry cell death, living tissue, and sensory descriptors of wines.\n\nBased on these metrics, the ML models developed in the related research demonstrate a high level of accuracy and reliability in assessing berry and wine quality traits. However, it is important to note that the extent to which these metrics can go in evaluating the models' performance depends on the specific context and requirements of the application. Further validation and testing may be necessary to determine the models' performance in different vineyard environments and grape varieties."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and machine learning (ML) models were used in the related research for assessment of berry cell death to assess berry cell death and estimate berry and wine quality traits. The research developed supervised regression ML models using NIR measurements from intact berries as inputs to estimate berry cell death (BCD) and living tissue (LT) (Model 1). Additionally, canopy architecture parameters obtained from cover photography of grapevine canopies and computer vision analysis were also tested as inputs to develop ML models to assess BCD and LT (Model 2). The results showed high accuracy and performance of these models in estimating berry and wine quality traits."
