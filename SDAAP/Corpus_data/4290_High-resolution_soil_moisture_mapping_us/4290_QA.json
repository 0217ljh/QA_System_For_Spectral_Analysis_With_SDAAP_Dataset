        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the PSO-based optimized CMAC in generating high-resolution surface soil moisture estimates is the Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error (NRMSE). This metric measures the average difference between the predicted soil moisture values and the actual in-situ measurements, normalized by the range of the in-situ measurements. \n\nThe NRMSE provides a quantitative measure of the accuracy of the soil moisture estimates generated by the PSO-based optimized CMAC."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the PSO-CMAC method can be considered superior to the PSO-GMDH method in terms of capturing soil moisture heterogeneity. The results of the study showed that the PSO-CMAC method had a higher accuracy and outperformed the PSO-GMDH method in both local and global approaches. Additionally, the study revealed that clustering the study area prior to running machine learning models, coupled with optical satellite imagery and geophysical properties, improved the predictive performance and led to more accurate mapping of soil moisture with more heterogeneity. Therefore, the PSO-CMAC method is more effective in capturing soil moisture heterogeneity compared to the PSO-GMDH method."
