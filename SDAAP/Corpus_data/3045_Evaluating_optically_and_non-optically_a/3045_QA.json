        "Output": "The role of ensemble learning algorithms in the assessment of optically active and non-optically active water quality parameters in Poyang Lake is to improve the accuracy of estimation. The paper suggests using ensemble learning algorithms, specifically LOOCV-XGBoost and LOOCV-GradientBoost, in combination with multi-source remote sensing images to estimate the water quality parameters. These algorithms are able to combine the strengths of multiple models and make more accurate predictions by reducing bias and variance. The results show that the LOOCV-XGBoost and LOOCV-GradientBoost algorithms provided higher inversion accuracy compared to the SEL algorithm. This demonstrates the potential of ensemble learning algorithms in improving the estimation of water quality parameters in inland lakes like Poyang Lake."

The related study states that the LOOCV-XGBoost and LOOCV-GradientBoost algorithms provided higher inversion accuracy for optically active (OAP) and non-optically active (NOAP) water quality parameters than the ensemble learning (SEL) algorithm. This demonstrates the great potential of combining hyperspectral images with LOOCV-ML algorithms for estimating water quality in inland lakes."
