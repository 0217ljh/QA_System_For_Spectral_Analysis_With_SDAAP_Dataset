        "input": "",
        "Output": "In this study, the combination of UAV-based hyperspectral measurements and machine learning (specifically the XGBoost algorithm) was compared to traditional methods for estimating rice yield in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\n\nTraditional methods, such as manual measurements within breeding programs, were found to be time-consuming, costly, and had low throughput. These limitations hindered their application in large-scale field phenotyping.\n\nOn the other hand, the combination of UAV-based hyperspectral measurements and machine learning provided a more accurate and efficient approach for estimating rice yield. The study used a hyperspectral camera mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to capture images of rice crops over multiple time series. These images were then analyzed using the XGBoost algorithm to develop a rice yield classification model.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the combination of UAV-based hyperspectral measurements and machine learning outperformed traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The classification accuracy of rice yield was improved by considering lodging characteristics at the midmature stage. This suggests that the degree of lodging is an important feature affecting the accuracy of rice classification.\n\nOverall, the combination of UAV-based hyperspectral measurements and machine learning provided a low-cost, high-throughput, and nondestructive method for estimating rice yield."
