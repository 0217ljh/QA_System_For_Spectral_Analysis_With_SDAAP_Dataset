        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the reliability of the calibrated model was the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions, while sensitivity measures the model's ability to correctly identify sound wheat kernels, and specificity measures the model's ability to correctly identify RW-damaged wheat kernels. \n\nThe accuracy of the model was reported to be 97%, indicating that 97% of the predictions made by the model were correct. The sensitivity of the model was reported to be 98%, meaning that the model correctly identified 98% of the sound wheat kernels. The specificity of the model was reported to be 96%, indicating that the model correctly identified 96% of the RW-damaged wheat kernels.\n\nThese metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and indicate that the calibrated model is reliable in identifying sound wheat kernels and RW-damaged wheat kernels."
