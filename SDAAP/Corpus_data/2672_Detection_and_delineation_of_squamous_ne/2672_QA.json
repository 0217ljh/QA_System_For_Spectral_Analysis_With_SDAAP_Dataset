        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine-learning techniques shows potential as a noninvasive tool for the detection and delineation of squamous neoplasia in the tongue. The study mentioned in the related study used HSI to acquire hyperspectral images of in vivo and ex vivo mouse tongues from a chemically induced tongue carcinogenesis model. Various machine-learning algorithms were evaluated for tongue neoplasia detection using HSI, and the diagnostic performance was compared to other imaging techniques. The study suggests that HSI combined with machine-learning techniques can provide a noninvasive tool for the quantitative detection and delineation of squamous neoplasia."
