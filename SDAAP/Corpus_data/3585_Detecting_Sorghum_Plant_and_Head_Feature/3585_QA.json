        "input": "",
        "Output": "Circularity was selected as a shape descriptor to quantify the difference between head clusters. This metric can be used to estimate the number of plants and count sorghum heads within each breeding plot by calculating the circularity for each head cluster and automatically determining threshold values to separate the clusters into different groups."
