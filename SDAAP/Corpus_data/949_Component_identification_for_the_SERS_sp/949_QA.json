        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of the CNN model in identifying and analyzing the chemical components in the SERS spectra of MPs mixture is higher than other classical algorithms. The average identification accuracy of MP components using the unpreprocessed spectral data trained by CNN is 99.54%. This accuracy is better than other classical algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), principal component analysis linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), Random Forest (RF), and K Near Neighbor (KNN), regardless of whether spectral preprocessing is applied or not. Therefore, the CNN model shows a higher accuracy in this study compared to other classical algorithms."
