        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the classifiers in the detection and classification of bruises in kiwifruit is the Correct Classification Rate (CCR). The CCR measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples in the test set. \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the CCR can provide a measure of how well the classifiers are able to correctly classify the bruising conditions in kiwifruit."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the results obtained in the related research, it can be concluded that the local spatio-spectral near-infrared hyperspectral imaging method is superior to traditional methods for detecting and classifying bruises in kiwifruit. The 3D-CNN and 2D-CNN classifiers based on PreActResNet and GoogLeNet models achieved high correct classification rates (CCR) for both unripe and ripe fruit samples. The CCRs ranged from 86% to 98% for the different classifiers and fruit ripening stages. This indicates that the hyperspectral imaging method is effective in accurately detecting and classifying bruises in kiwifruit, especially in the case of unripe fruit."
