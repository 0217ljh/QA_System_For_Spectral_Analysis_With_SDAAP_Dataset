        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the inversion accuracy of the models is the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable (evapotranspiration in this case) that can be explained by the independent variables (feature factors and spectral indices). It ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model to the data."

        "Output": "The multiple linear regression (MLR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) inversion models were used in the analysis of surface evapotranspiration in the lower Yangtze River urban cluster by constructing these models with evapotranspiration as the target variable. The models were developed using Landsat 8 OIL_TIRS data, remote sensing image data, soil data, and meteorological data of the study area for the period of 2016-2021. \n\nThe MLR model and ELM inversion model were used to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the spatial and temporal variability in surface evapotranspiration in the study area over the past six years. The models were based on feature factors and spectral indices, and their inversion accuracy was evaluated. The fusion of feature factors was found to effectively improve the inversion ability of the model for evapotranspiration (ET).\n\nThe MLR model was identified as the best model for ET in 2016, 2017, and 2021, with an R-2 greater than 0.8."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the fusion of feature factors in the MLR and ELM inversion models can be considered a superior method for estimating evapotranspiration (ET) in the lower Yangtze River urban cluster over a six-year period. The results of the study show that both models based on feature factors and spectral indices obtained a good inversion accuracy, with the fusion of feature factors effectively improving the inversion ability of the model for ET. This suggests that combining multiple factors and variables, such as net solar radiation, soil heat flux, soil temperature and humidity, and fractional vegetation cover, enhances the accuracy and reliability of the estimation of ET. Therefore, the fusion of feature factors in the MLR and ELM inversion models can be considered a superior method for estimating ET in the study area."
