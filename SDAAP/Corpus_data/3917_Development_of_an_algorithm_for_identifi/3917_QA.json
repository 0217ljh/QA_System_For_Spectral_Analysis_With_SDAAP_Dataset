        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the algorithm developed in the related study can be used to assess the state of sown biodiverse pastures (SBP) and for compliance checks of farmer commitments in other regions. The study specifically focuses on the Portuguese region of Alentejo and its results are described as a critical first step towards the future development of remote systems for assessing the state of SBP and compliance checks of farmer commitments. Therefore, further research and adaptation of the algorithm would be necessary to determine its applicability in other regions."
