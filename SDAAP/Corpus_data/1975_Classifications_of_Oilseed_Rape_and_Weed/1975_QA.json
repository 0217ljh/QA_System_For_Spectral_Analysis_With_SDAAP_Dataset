        "input": "",
        "Output": "The classification method using selected wavelengths of PCA loadings, x-loading weights, and SPA based on de-trending preprocessed spectra outperforms traditional methods in distinguishing between oilseed rape and weeds using hyperspectral information. The overall results show that the extreme learning machine (ELM) models with these selected wavelengths achieved 100% classification accuracy for both the calibration set and the prediction set. This indicates that the ELM models with the selected wavelengths are highly effective in accurately identifying oilseed rape and weeds. Additionally, the index of average classification accuracy, which evaluates classification models accuracy under different experimental time, further supports the feasibility of using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging for this purpose. Therefore, the classification method using selected wavelengths of PCA loadings, x-loading weights, and SPA based on de-trending preprocessed spectra is superior to traditional methods in distinguishing between oilseed rape and weeds using hyperspectral information."
