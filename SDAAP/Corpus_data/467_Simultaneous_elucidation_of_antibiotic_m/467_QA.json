        "Output": "Yes, high-throughput Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for discriminating the mechanism of action (MOA) of antibiotics at different levels. The study emonstrates that FTIR spectroscopy, when combined with machine learning algorithms, can accurately discriminate the MOA of antibiotics at the pathway, class, and individual antibiotic level. The results show that the method consistently achieves very good accuracies, independently of the algorithms used. Additionally, the past study suggests that FTIR spectroscopy can even probe the grey chemical matter, achieving over 70% accuracy at very low concentrations and growth inhibition. Therefore, the use of high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy offers a promising approach for efficiently and accurately determining the MOA of antibiotics, surpassing the limitations of traditional methods."
