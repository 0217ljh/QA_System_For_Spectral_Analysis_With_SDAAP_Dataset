        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with machine learning methods can be considered a superior and practical chemometric tool for discriminating the storage freshness of rice and distinguishing their storage years, compared to traditional methods. The related study demonstrates that NIRS combined with machine learning methods such as least square support vector machine (LSSVM), random forest (RF), and principal component-neural network (PC-NN) outperformed the typical chemometric method, partial least squares (PLS), in terms of model training and testing accuracy. The LSSVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 95.7% in distinguishing three labeled storage years of rice. The RF and PC-NN models also showed high accuracies after hyperparameter training. This indicates the potential of NIRS and machine learning methods as a nondestructive and rapid detection technology for estimating the time of storage of rice and evaluating its quality."
