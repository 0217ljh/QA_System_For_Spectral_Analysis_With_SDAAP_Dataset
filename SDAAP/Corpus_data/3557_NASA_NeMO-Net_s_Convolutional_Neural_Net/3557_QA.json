        "Output": "The purpose of developing the object-based fully convolutional network (FCN) in the related study is to improve upon the spatial-spectral classification problem inherent in multimodal datasets. The researchers aimed to address the challenges posed by large spectral variances due to various factors such as time of observation, atmospheric effects, water column properties, and heterogeneous instruments and calibrations. By using FCNs, they were able to effectively identify the relative applicable spectral and spatial spaces within an image, leading to better overall classification and segmentation results."

        "Output": "The use of the object-based fully convolutional network (FCN) in the related study showed better overall classification and segmentation results compared to traditional pixel-based classical methods. The FCN was able to effectively identify the relative applicable spectral and spatial spaces within an image, while the pixel-based classical methods excelled at classification within those identified spaces. The study achieved a total accuracy of approximately 85% and 80% for the FCN when trained and tested on minimally preprocessed WorldView-2 and Planet satellite imagery, respectively, over nine classes."
