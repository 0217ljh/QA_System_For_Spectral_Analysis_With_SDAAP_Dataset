        "input": "",
        "Output": "The feature filtering algorithms combined with machine learning algorithms played a crucial role in the identification of seed maturity stages in the research on classifying Siberian wild rye seeds. These algorithms, namely minimal joint mutual information maximization (JMIM), information gain, and Gini impurity, were employed to filter the features and assess the impact of retaining only 20% of the features on the model performance.\n\nThe filtering algorithms revealed that autofluorescence and morphological features such as CIELab A, CIELab B, hue, and saturation were highly correlated with seed maturity stages. By selecting these relevant features, the algorithms reduced the dimensionality of the data and improved the efficiency of the classification models.\n\nThe machine learning models, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM), were then applied to classify the seeds at different maturity stages. These models showed high performance with accuracies exceeding 0.78, indicating their effectiveness in accurately identifying seed maturity stages.\n\nAdditionally, the K-means approach was used to address the considerable variation in different grain positions at the maturity stage. By applying this technique, the model performance was further improved by 5.8%-9.24%."
