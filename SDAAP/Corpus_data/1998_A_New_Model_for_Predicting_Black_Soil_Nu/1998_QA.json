        "Output": "The machine learning models were used to predict soil nutrient content in black soil rich in nutrients in Northeast China using aerial hyperspectral data by establishing a regression model between the spectral data and the nutrient content. Three machine learning models were selected for this purpose: the eps-regression support vector machine (SVM) model, the BP neural network, and the PLS1 least square regression model. \n\nThe SVM method was specifically used to extract the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium in the aerial hyperspectral data. The prediction accuracy of the three models was evaluated, and it was found that the SVM method had the highest accuracy in extracting the information of total nitrogen and total phosphorus.\n\nOn the other hand, the neural network method was used to retrieve the information of organic matter. This method was found to be the most accurate for the extraction of organic matter and total potassium, with errors of 1.21% and 0.81% respectively.\n\nOverall, the machine learning models were trained using the spectral data and the corresponding nutrient content obtained from soil samples collected in the Jiansanjiang area in Heilongjiang."

        "Output": "The spectral statistic, spectral characteristics, and spectral values computed from aerial hyperspectral data were found to be effective in predicting soil nutrient content in black soil rich in nutrients in Northeast China. The study revealed that these computed spectra provided an effective representation of the soil's comprehensive reflectance situation. The accuracy of the prediction models varied for different nutrients. The neural network method was the most accurate for extracting organic matter and total potassium, with errors of 1.21% and 0.81% respectively. The support vector machine (SVM) method had the highest accuracy for extracting total nitrogen and total phosphorus, although the errors were slightly higher at 6.05% and 2.74% respectively. Overall, the comprehensive accuracy of aerial hyperspectral extraction of soil nutrients was evaluated, and the extraction errors ranged from 2.74% to 8.90%, with the highest accuracy observed for total phosphorus retrieval."
