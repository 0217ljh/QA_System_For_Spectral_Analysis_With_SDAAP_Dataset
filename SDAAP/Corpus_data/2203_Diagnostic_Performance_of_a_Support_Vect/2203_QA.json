        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to classify the lesions as malignant melanoma or non-melanoma is a scoring system that scales linearly with the number of malignant spectra. A lesion is classified as malignant melanoma if the score is greater than 28, and as non-melanoma if the score is less than or equal to 28. \n\nThe effectiveness of this metric is measured by its sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity of the scoring algorithm in diagnosing malignant melanoma is 91.7%, which means it correctly identifies 91.7% of the malignant melanoma cases. The specificity is 83.0%, indicating that it correctly identifies 83.0% of the non-melanoma cases. \n\nAdditionally, when image segmentation is used for normalization of the lesions' region of interest, the sensitivity improves to 95.8%, while the specificity decreases slightly to 80.9%."

        "Output": "The support vector machine classifier in the machine learning algorithm for distinguishing between benign and malignant melanocytic tumors in the FLIMMA study was trained on 17,918 fluorescence spectra from 49 lesions. These spectra were labeled as either malignant (1) or benign (0) by three histopathologists."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, spectroscopic methods were used in the machine learning algorithm developed in the study to distinguish between benign and malignant melanocytic tumors in vivo. The fluorescence spectra collected during the FLIMMA study were retrospectively analyzed by the algorithm. This analysis, along with the histopathological results from the tissue samples, helped train the support vector machine classifier to classify the lesions as malignant or benign. The algorithm's scoring system, which takes into account the number of malignant spectra, was designed to improve the accuracy of diagnosing malignant melanoma. The algorithm was validated on additional lesions to ensure its prediction power and estimate the diagnostic accuracy of dermatofluoroscopy in melanoma detection. The results showed that the scoring algorithm had a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 83.0% in diagnosing malignant melanoma. Additionally, when image segmentation was used for normalization of the lesions' region of interest, the sensitivity improved to 95.8%, with a corresponding specificity of 80.9%. Therefore, the use of spectroscopic methods in the machine learning algorithm helped improve the accuracy of diagnosing malignant melanoma and reduce unnecessary excisions."
