        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for detecting different diseases on tomato leaves was the overall classification accuracy. The study reported that the overall classification accuracy of the models based on spectral information ranged from 97.1% to 100% in testing sets. However, when using the eight texture features, the classification accuracy ranged from 69.9% to 71.8% in the ELM models. Therefore, the metric of overall classification accuracy achieved high accuracy levels ranging from 97.1% to 100% when using spectral information, but lower accuracy levels ranging from 69.9% to 71.8% when using texture features."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided, hyperspectral imaging can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for detecting different diseases on tomato leaves. The established models using hyperspectral imaging achieved overall classification accuracy ranging from 97.1% to 100% in testing sets. This indicates that hyperspectral imaging is highly accurate in identifying diseases on tomato leaves."
