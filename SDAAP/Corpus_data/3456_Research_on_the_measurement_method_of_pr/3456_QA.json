According to the related study, the CARS algorithm was used along with the Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) to extract characteristic wavelengths from the preprocessed information. The test results showed that the CARS-SVR algorithm models had the best prediction effect, indicating that the CARS algorithm successfully extracted relevant features from the ink content spectrum information."
