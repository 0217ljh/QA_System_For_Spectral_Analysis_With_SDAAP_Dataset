        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the landslide susceptibility prediction performance in the study was the Area Under Curve (AUC) value. The AUC value represents the overall performance of the prediction model, with a higher value indicating better accuracy. In the related study, the AUC value for the landslide susceptibility prediction from aerial photogrammetric datasets was 92%. This indicates that the prediction model had a high level of accuracy in identifying areas prone to landslides."
