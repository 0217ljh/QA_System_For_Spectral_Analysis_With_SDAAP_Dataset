The evaluation metrics used were root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R-2) values. These metrics were used to assess the performance of the models in predicting the basal area (m(2)/ha), stem volume (m(3)/ha), and stem density (number/ha) of the forest stands. The model with the lowest RMSE and MAE values and the highest R-2 value was considered to have the best performance in estimating the forest stand characteristics."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the BART algorithm was compared to three other machine learning algorithms, namely generalised linear model (GLM), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM), in estimating and mapping forest stand characteristics. The results showed that BART generated the best predictions for basal area and stem volume, followed by GLM, SVM, and KNN. The BART algorithm had the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) values for both basal area (8.12 m(2)/ha) and stem volume (29.28 m(3)/ha) estimation, indicating higher accuracy compared to the other algorithms. Therefore, the BART algorithm outperformed the other machine learning algorithms in estimating and mapping forest stand characteristics."
