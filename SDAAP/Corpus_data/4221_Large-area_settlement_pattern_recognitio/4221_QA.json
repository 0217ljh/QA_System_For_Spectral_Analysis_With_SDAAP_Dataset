        "Output": "The main objectives of the study are to develop an image processing and analysis pipeline using object-based image analysis and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Landsat-8 data in order to:\n1. Identify built-up areas.\n2. Classify settlement types.\n3. Recognize urban structure types.\n4. Assess the influence of improved spatial and spectral resolution of Landsat-8 on SVM performance for identifying built-up areas and urban structure types.\n5. Test the influence of an extended feature space, including digital elevation model features, in mountainous regions.\n6. Analyze the spatial distribution of classification uncertainties and compare them to the heterogeneity of the building stock within the computational unit of the segments.\n7. Determine if Landsat-8 images contain sufficient information for the tested classification tasks and if detailed urban structures can be extracted with satisfying accuracy.\n8. Evaluate the potential improvement of built-up area classification by using freely available ancillary settlement point location data.\n9. Assess the impact of digital elevation features and pan-sharpening on the classification results.\n10. Highlight the importance of dynamically tuned classifier parameters.\n11. Validate the use of Shannon entropy computed from the soft answers of the SVM as a measure of the spatial distribution of classification uncertainties."
