        "input": "",
        "Output": "Based on the findings of the study, the use of hyperspectral sensors for mapping plastics in the environment is more effective compared to the use of multispectral sensors. The study found that most multispectral sensors were not able to differentiate between plastic types, while hyperspectral sensors were able to do so. Hyperspectral sensors, with their ability to capture a wide range of spectral bands, allowed for the resolution of absorption bands of plastics and thus enabled accurate classification of plastic types. In particular, sensors with narrow SWIR channels at central wavelengths of 1141, 1217, 1697, and 1716 nm, combined with narrow bandwidths of 10-20 nm, showed the highest capability for plastic differentiation. Therefore, the study suggests that hyperspectral sensors are more suitable for detecting and mapping plastics in the environment compared to multispectral sensors."
