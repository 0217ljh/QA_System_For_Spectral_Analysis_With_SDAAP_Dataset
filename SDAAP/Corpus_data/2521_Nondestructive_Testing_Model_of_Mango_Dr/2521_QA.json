        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction performance of the models for determining the dry matter of mango is the correlation coefficient. The specific correlation coefficients used are R-C(2), RP2, RMSEC, and RMSEP. \n\nThe correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, it is used to assess the relationship between the predicted dry matter values and the actual dry matter values of the mango samples.\n\nThe correlation coefficient can range from -1 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a strong positive correlation and values closer to -1 indicating a strong negative correlation. A value of 0 indicates no correlation.\n\nIn the related study, the best prediction performance was achieved by the (CARS + RF)-SPA-BPNN model, which had a correlation coefficient of R-C(2) = 0.9710. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the predicted dry matter values and the actual dry matter values of the mango samples.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of correlation coefficient provides a reliable measure of the prediction performance of the models in terms of their ability to accurately predict the dry matter of mangoes."

        "Output": "The (CARS + RF)-SPA-BPNN model outperforms traditional methods in predicting mango dry matter using hyperspectral fluorescence imaging technology. The results show that this model has the best prediction performance, with correlation coefficients of R-C(2) = 0.9710, RP2 = 0.9658, RMSEC = 0.1418, and RMSEP = 0.1526. These values indicate a strong correlation between the predicted dry matter values and the actual dry matter values of the mango samples. This model provides a reliable theoretical basis and technical support for non-destructive detection and the precise and intelligent development of mango dry matter detection."
