The results showed that both the deep learning (DL) and random forest (RF) models had a strong prediction capacity for the plant height (PH) variable, with a correlation coefficient (r) surpassing 0.77. The DL model was superior in predicting the days to maturity (DM) variable, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.66 when the input variable was the spectral bands. For the grain yield (GY) variable, all machine learning models evaluated had similar performance, with correlation coefficients (r) ranging from 0.42 to 0.44 for each tested scenario."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of spectral bands in machine learning and deep learning methods can improve the prediction of multiple agronomic variables for soybean cultivars compared to traditional methods. The study proposes a machine learning approach that utilizes multispectral bands to predict days to maturity (DM), plant height (PH), and grain yield (GY) for soybean cultivars. The results indicate that both deep learning (DL) and random forest (RF) models showed strong prediction capacity for the PH variable, regardless of the input variables group. The DL model was also found to be superior in predicting DM when the input variable was the spectral bands. Overall, the study demonstrates that the use of spectral bands in machine learning and deep learning methods can be an efficient computational solution for predicting multiple important soybean crop variables based on remote sensing data."
