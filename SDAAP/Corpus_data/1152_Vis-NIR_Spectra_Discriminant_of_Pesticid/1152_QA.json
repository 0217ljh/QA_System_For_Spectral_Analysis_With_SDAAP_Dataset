        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models (support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM)) were used to verify the performance of the proposed model in the assessment of pesticide residues on the Hami melon surface by comparing their average accuracy with the CNN models (AlexNet and VGG-16). The CNN models had higher average accuracy than the SVM and ELM models, indicating that they had a better effect in identifying whether there were pesticide residues on the Hami melon surface. This comparison helped validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-scale CNN model in the qualitative discriminant analysis of pesticide residues on the Hami melon surface."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the gramian angular difference fields (GADF) transformation can be used in the assessment of pesticide residues on the surface of Hami melons using visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy combined with a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The study mentioned in the text assessed the feasibility of using Vis/NIR spectroscopy and GADF transformation for the qualitative discriminant of pesticide residues on Hami melon surfaces. The results showed that the proposed multi-scale CNN model, incorporating the GADF transformation, had the best performance in identifying whether there were pesticide residues on the Hami melon surface."
