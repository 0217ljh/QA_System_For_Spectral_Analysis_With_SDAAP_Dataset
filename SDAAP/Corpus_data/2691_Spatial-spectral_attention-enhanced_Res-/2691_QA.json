        "Output": "The metric chosen to recognize corn and weed in the field is recognition accuracy. The related study states that the recognition accuracy of the proposed model is 98.56%. This metric indicates the percentage of correctly identified instances of corn and weed in the hyperspectral images. The proposed model achieves a high recognition accuracy of 98.56%, which is significantly higher than the recognition accuracy of other models such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM), which are 8.65% and 10.20% lower, respectively. Additionally, the proposed model also outperforms 3D residual network (3D-ResNet) and 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) with an increase in recognition precision of 1.40% and 1.02% respectively. Therefore, the chosen metric of recognition accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in accurately identifying corn and weed in hyperspectral images."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed model combines hyperspectral image with deep learning methods to recognize corn and weed in the field by following a specific approach. Firstly, the model extracts four principal components based on principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the redundancy of adjacent spectra in the hyperspectral image. This step helps in decreasing the information redundancy between adjacent spectra.\n\nSecondly, the model utilizes the residual three-dimensional octave convolution (Res-3D-OctConv) to extract both spatial and spectral information from the frequency components. This approach allows for the excavation of important spatial information while considering the spectral information as well.\n\nTo further enhance the recognition process, the model incorporates spatial and spectral attention models. These attention models highlight important spatial and spectral information, respectively. By integrating the spatial and spectral information through cross fusion, the model effectively combines both aspects to improve recognition accuracy.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.56%. This accuracy is significantly higher compared to traditional methods such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM), with improvements of 8.65% and 10.20% respectively."
