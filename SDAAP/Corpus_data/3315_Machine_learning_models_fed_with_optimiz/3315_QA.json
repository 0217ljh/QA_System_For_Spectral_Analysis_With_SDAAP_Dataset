        "Output": "The metric chosen to improve the prediction accuracy of plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) at the vegetative growth stage was the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R2 value ranged from 0.51 to 0.85, indicating that the models explained 51% to 85% of the variance in PNC. The RMSE ranged from 0.15% to 0.34%, which represents the average difference between the predicted PNC values and the actual PNC values. Therefore, these metrics provide an assessment of the accuracy and precision of the machine learning models in predicting PNC."

The algorithms used were:\n\n1. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)\n2. Random Forest (RF)\n3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n4. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\n\nThese algorithms were fed with three different types of input variables: optimized spectral indices (OSI), sensitive spectral bands (SSB), and full-spectrum (FS). The performance of the ML models was evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict PNC in ten field trials conducted in different locations from 2005 to 2016.\n\nThe results showed that the input variable had a significant influence on the performance of the ML models. The OSI was found to be the most efficient input variable for all tested ML algorithms in predicting PNC. Among the ML algorithms, the RF models based on OSI consistently outperformed the other models, regardless of the crop being studied.\n\nThe evaluation metrics used to assess the prediction accuracy of the ML models were the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R2 values ranged from 0.51 to 0.85, indicating moderate to strong correlations between"

        "Output": "In the related study, the use of optimized spectral indices (OSI), sensitive spectral bands (SSB), and full-spectrum (FS) contributed to improving the prediction accuracy of plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) at the vegetative growth stage. The researchers applied machine learning (ML) algorithms fed with these input variables to predict PNC in wheat, maize, rice, potato, and across crops. \n\nThe results showed that the OSI was the most efficient input variable for the tested ML algorithms in predicting PNC. The OSI-based random forest (RF) models consistently outperformed other models regardless of the crop. The coefficient of determination (R2) ranged from 0.51 to 0.85, and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.15% to 0.34% in the experimental validation datasets.\n\nBy selecting PNC-related spectral features across crops, the OSI-based RF models increased prediction accuracy by 10-31% compared to the best OSI-simple regression models. This improvement was attributed to the fact that the OSI-based RF models may be independent of canopy structure variation and the 'N-dilution' effect, which are known challenges in accurately assessing PNC using spectral indices."
