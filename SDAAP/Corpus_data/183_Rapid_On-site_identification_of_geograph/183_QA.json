This preprocessing method was used to enhance the spectral data and improve the accuracy of the discriminant model.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the results showed that the discriminant model achieved high accuracy in identifying the origin and storage age of tangerine peel. The origin identification accuracy was reported to be 96.99%, indicating that the model could accurately distinguish the geographical origin of the tangerine peel. Additionally, the storage age identification accuracy was 100% for Guangdong tangerine peel and 97.15% for Sichuan tangerine peel, suggesting that the model could effectively determine the storage age of the tangerine peel.\n\nOverall, the chosen metric, SGFD-LDA, demonstrated high accuracy in identifying the origin and storage age of tangerine peel, making it a reliable method for on-site identification using near-infrared spectroscopy combined with machine learning."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized to identify the geographical origin and storage age of tangerine peel using the handheld NIR spectrometer. The process involved several steps:\n\n1. Outlier detection: Principal component analysis (PCA) combined with Mahalanobis distance was used to detect outliers in the NIR diffuse reflectance spectra of tangerine peel. This step helped identify and remove samples that deviated significantly from the norm.\n\n2. Clustering analysis: After removing the outliers, PCA was performed on tangerine peels from different origins and the same origin with different storage ages. This analysis aimed to explore the clustering characteristics of tangerine peels based on their spectral data. The results showed that tangerine peels from the same origin or the same storage age tended to cluster together, indicating a certain similarity in their spectral data.\n\n3. Preprocessing: To achieve qualitative identification of origin and storage age, the raw spectra were preprocessed using Savitzky-Golay convolution smoothing with first derivative (SGFD) and standard normal variate (SNV). This preprocessing step helped enhance the quality of the spectral data and reduce noise.\n\n4. Discriminant modeling: Three machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN"
