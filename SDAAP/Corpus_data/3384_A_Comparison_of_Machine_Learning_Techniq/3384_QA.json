        "Output": "The results of the related study comparing machine learning techniques for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) using remote sensing data support the use of nonparametric machine learning algorithms over traditional methods, such as parametric multiple linear regression (MLR).\n\nThe study found that the three most common nonparametric machine learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and Random Forest (RF), outperformed MLR in estimating AGB. Specifically, SVM performed best after parameter optimization, while RF could outperform SVM in certain cases. However, kNN yielded the best overall results in terms of goodness-of-fit measures.\n\nThese findings suggest that nonparametric machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, kNN, and RF, are powerful tools for estimating AGB using datasets derived from sensors with medium spatial resolution. Compared to traditional parametric methods like MLR, nonparametric machine learning algorithms offer better accuracy and performance in recognizing patterns and mapping AGB. Therefore, the study supports the use of nonparametric machine learning algorithms for the evaluation and management of forest ecosystems based on remote sensing data."
