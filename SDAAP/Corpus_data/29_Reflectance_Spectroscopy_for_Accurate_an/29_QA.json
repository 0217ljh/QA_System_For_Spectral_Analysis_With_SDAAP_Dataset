        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the analysis models for analyzing the content of saturated fatty acids in edible oils was the determination coefficient of prediction set (R-P(2)) and the root mean square error of prediction set (RMSEp). \n\nThe S2DCRN model obtained an R-P(2) value of 0.9879 and an RMSEp value of 0.5100 after pretreatment of the edible oil spectra. This indicates that the model had a high level of accuracy and precision in predicting the content of saturated fatty acids in the edible oils.\n\nFurthermore, after selecting important wavelength spectra using a combination of RFrog and SFS, the S2DCRN model exhibited excellent performance with an R-P(2) value of 0.9679 and an RMSEp value of 0.4627. Although slightly worse than the results obtained using the full spectra, the number of wavelengths selected was less than 1% of the full spectra. This reduction in complexity while maintaining a high level of accuracy is beneficial for the development of portable and simplified detection devices.\n\nOverall, the chosen metrics demonstrated that the S2DCRN model performed well in accurately and rapidly analyzing various fatty acids in edible vegetable oils using reflectance spectroscopy."
