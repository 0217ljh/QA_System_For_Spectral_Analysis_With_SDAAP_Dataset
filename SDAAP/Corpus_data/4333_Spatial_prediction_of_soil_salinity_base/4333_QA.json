The research demonstrates that synthesizing multitemporal remote sensing images using a cloud computing platform, such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), and employing spectral indices can improve the prediction accuracy of salinity mapping. The study also shows that choosing the most appropriate time window for synthesizing remote sensing images using GEE has a better prediction effect compared to using single-date images. Additionally, integrating a local scikit-learn machine learning library with GEE using Geemap enhances model optimization and mapping performance. These advancements in spectral feature processing methods contribute to more accurate and reliable mapping of salinity at a regional scale using remote sensing technology."
