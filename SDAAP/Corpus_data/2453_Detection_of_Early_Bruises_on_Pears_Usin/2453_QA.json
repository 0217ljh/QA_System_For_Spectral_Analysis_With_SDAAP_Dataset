        "input": "",
        "Output": "In their study on the detection of fruit bruise using fluorescence hyperspectral imaging, the researchers optimized the support vector machine (SVM) model using several methods. These methods included cross-validation, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and network search algorithms. These algorithms were used and compared to find the best parameters for the SVM model. By using these optimization techniques, the researchers were able to improve the accuracy of the SVM model in distinguishing different bruise levels and bruised time of pears."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the findings of the related study, fluorescence hyperspectral imaging can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for the early detection of fruit bruise. The study showed that different bruise levels could be identified as early as 15 minutes after bruising, with an accuracy of 93.33%. Additionally, when discriminating between sound and bruised samples, the accuracy was as high as 99.33%. These results suggest that fluorescence hyperspectral imaging has certain feasibility in the early bruise detection of fruits, indicating its potential superiority over traditional methods."
