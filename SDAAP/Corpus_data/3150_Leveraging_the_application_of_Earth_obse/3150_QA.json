        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes.Based on the information provided in the related study, it can be inferred that spectral and terrain features extracted from Earth observation data (EOD) are considered superior to traditional methods for high-resolution mapping of key topsoil attributes in cropland soils in Brazil. The study aimed at performing high-resolution mapping of these attributes using EOD, and the prediction models based on the environmental predictors obtained from EOD data achieved good performance metrics, with R2 values ranging from 0.44 to 0.74. These models were able to accurately predict the content of clay, sand, soil organic carbon (SOC), and SOC stocks. The resulting maps revealed the variability of topsoil among the cropped areas and provided additional information at the local and regional scales. Therefore, the use of spectral and terrain features extracted from EOD data proved to be valuable for mapping and monitoring cropland soils at finer resolutions, supporting the evaluation of soil spatial distribution and historical agriculture expansion over large geographical areas."
