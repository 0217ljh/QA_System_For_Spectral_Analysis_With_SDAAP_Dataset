        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study evaluated the performance of different models to estimate the fresh matter biomass (FMB) of lablab, maize, and finger millet crops using two evaluation metrics: R-2 validation (R-val(2)) and relative root mean square error prediction (rRMSEP). These metrics were used to assess the accuracy and precision of the FMB models. The models were built using the random forest regression method. The study compared the performance of the Generalised model (combination of rainfed and irrigated data) with separate FMB models for rainfed and irrigated conditions. The Generalised model performed better for all three crops (lablab, maize, and finger millet) in terms of R-val(2) and rRMSEP. The deviation of predicted and measured FMB did not differ significantly among the different levels of nitrogen and water supply. However, there was a trend of overestimation at the initial stage and underestimation at the later stages of crop growth."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, terrestrial hyperspectral imaging is considered an effective tool to estimate the fresh matter biomass (FMB) of lablab, maize, and finger millet crops. The study collected spectral images and FMB data over three years for lablab, maize, and finger millet crops under different levels of nitrogen fertiliser and water supply. The study used the random forest regression method to build FMB models and evaluated them using R-2 validation (R-val(2)) and relative root mean square error prediction (rRMSEP). The results showed that the generalised model, which combined rainfed (R) and irrigated (I) data, performed better for all three crops compared to separate FMB models for R and I. The wavelength ranges of 546-910 nm (lablab), 750-794 nm (maize), and 686-814 nm (finger millet) were identified as the most important variables for estimating biomass. Therefore, based on these findings, terrestrial hyperspectral imaging can be considered a superior method for estimating FMB compared to traditional methods in this study."
