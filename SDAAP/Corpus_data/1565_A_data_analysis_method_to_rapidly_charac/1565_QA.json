        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine-learning models were utilized in the analysis of gallium concentration in plutonium matrices using the hand-held LIBS instrument by developing software that can identify gallium and quantify its concentration. The software uses machine-learning algorithms to analyze the emission spectrum obtained from the LIBS measurements. It is trained on a dataset that includes known concentrations of gallium in plutonium matrices, allowing it to learn the patterns and characteristics of the gallium emission lines. Once trained, the software can then accurately identify gallium and determine its concentration in unknown samples based on the emission spectrum. This approach provides a rapid and nearly nondestructive technique for characterizing the composition of materials in complex actinide-associated targets."

The article describes the development of machine-learning software that can identify gallium and quantify its concentration in plutonium matrices using a hand-held LIBS instrument. This approach offers a rapid and nearly nondestructive technique for characterizing the composition of materials in complex actinide-associated targets. The traditional methods may not be as efficient or accurate in analyzing actinide-containing samples due to the complexity of their spectra."
