        "Output": "Fisher linear discriminate analysis (Fisher LDA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) were used comparatively in the authentication of edible animal blood food (EABF) using Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) coupled with fast chemometrics. \n\nIn this study, a total of 540 samples of EABF were analyzed, including raw duck blood tofu (DBT), cow blood-based gel (CBG), pig blood-based gel (PBG), and adulterated samples of DBT with CBG and PBG. The protein, fat, total sugar, and 16 types of amino acids were measured to validate the differences in basic organic matters among EABFs based on species.\n\nBoth Fisher LDA and ELM were implemented to identify the adulterated EABF. Fisher LDA is a statistical technique used for classification and discrimination analysis. It aims to find a linear combination of features that maximizes the separation between different classes. In this case, Fisher LDA was used to classify the EABF samples based on their spectral variables.\n\nOn the other hand, ELM is a machine learning algorithm that is known for its fast learning speed and good generalization performance. It was also used for classification in this study, specifically for identifying the"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the FT-NIR coupled with fast chemometrics technique can be considered a superior method for the authentication of edible animal blood food (EABF) compared to traditional methods. The study mentioned in the text demonstrates that this technique, when combined with Fisher linear discriminate analysis (Fisher LDA) and extreme learning machine (ELM), provides a higher accuracy of 93.89% in identifying adulterated EABF compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the optimized extreme learning machine regression (ELMR) models showed high correlation coefficients, low root mean square errors, and high residual prediction deviation and range error ratios, indicating the effectiveness of this technique in predicting adulteration levels. Overall, the results suggest that FT-NIR coupled with fast chemometrics has great potential in authenticating EABF and can be used to manage the EABF market, preventing illegal adulteration and unfair competition."
