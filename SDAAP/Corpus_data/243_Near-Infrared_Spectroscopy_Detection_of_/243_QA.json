        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the model proposed in the research is the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficients for the prediction set of cotton and polyester contents are reported as 0.9927 and 0.9903, respectively. This metric measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted values and the actual values. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation and -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation. In this case, the high correlation coefficients suggest a strong linear relationship between the predicted and actual values, indicating that the model has a high level of accuracy in predicting the content of each component in cotton-polyester blended fabric."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers utilized dropout in the deep belief network (DBN) model by hiding some hidden layer nodes. This technique effectively prevented the model from overfitting and reduced the interdependence between nodes. By sparsifying the network, the ability of nonlinear modeling and network model generalization was enhanced."

        "Output": "The proposed Dropout-DBN method has much higher accuracy and adaptability compared to traditional modeling methods for predicting the content of cotton and polyester in cotton-polyester blended fabric using near-infrared spectroscopy and deep learning theory. The correlation coefficients of the prediction set for cotton and polyester contents are 0.9927 and 0.9903, respectively. Additionally, the root mean square errors of the prediction set are 0.0792 and 0.0869, respectively. These results indicate that the Dropout-DBN method outperforms other modeling methods, making it more suitable for model transfer and sharing and improving the overall intelligence of the model."
