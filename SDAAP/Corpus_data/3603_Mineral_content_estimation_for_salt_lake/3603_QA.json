        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the estimation models in the related study was the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE measures the average percentage difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the mineral content. \n\nThe results of the study showed that the estimation models constructed using the feature optimization method with the genetic algorithm (GA) performed well in estimating the mineral content. Specifically, the GA-RF model achieved a reduction in MAPE of 77.52% for lithium (Li) content, 28.54% for boron (B) content, and 36.79% for Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) content on the testing set. \n\nFurthermore, the GA-RF model obtained optimal performance compared to the GA-MLR and GA-PLSR models for estimating Li, B, and TDS content. The GA-RF model achieved high values of R-squared (R^2) for Li (0.99), B (0.97), and TDS (0.93), indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values were also relatively low, indicating small errors in the estimation."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the spectral mathematical transformation method used in this study can be applied to estimate the mineral content of salt lakes on the Tibetan Plateau for other elements besides lithium (Li), boron (B), and total dissolved solids (TDS). The study specifically focused on estimating the Li, B, and TDS contents of Bieruoze Co and Guopu Co lakes using the intelligent prediction model. Therefore, it is unclear whether the same method would be applicable for estimating the mineral content of other elements in salt lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. Further research would be needed to determine the applicability of this method for other elements."
