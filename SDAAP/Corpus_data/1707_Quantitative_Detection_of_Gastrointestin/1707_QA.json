        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the gene feature selection model based on the PCA algorithm and multicolor QDs immunobiosensor can be used to detect gastrointestinal tumor markers using spectroscopic methods. The study mentioned in the text utilized fluorescence spectroscopy and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy to identify and quantify the quantum dot-antibody conjugates.\n\nCompared to traditional detection methods, the results showed that the classification precision of the gene feature selection model (OPCA) in colon tumor and gastric cancer datasets was significantly higher (99.52% and 99.03%, respectively) than that of other algorithms. The classification accuracy was also higher (94.86% and 94.2%, respectively). This indicates that the OPCA model based on the PCA algorithm can obtain fewer feature gene sets and improve the accuracy of sample classification.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that the fluorescence values of the tumor markers reached their maximum when using the QDs-based immunobiosensors. The highest recovery rate of one of the tumor markers (AFP) was 98.51%, and its fluorescence intensity was significantly higher than that of other antigens.\n\nTherefore, the gene feature selection model based on the PCA algorithm and multicolor QDs immunobiosensor shows promise in detecting gastrointestinal tumor markers using spectroscopic methods.
