        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the presented intelligent assessment approach for classifying the weathering degree of building sandstone in a humid environment can be applied to other types of stone materials. The focus of the study seems to be specifically on building sandstone. Therefore, it is unclear whether the same approach would be applicable to other types of stone materials without further information or research."
