        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy for the classification of moldy, healthy, and damaged peanuts is the average accuracy, F1 score, and kappa coefficient. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the BIA method for moldy peanut classification. The average accuracy measures the overall correctness of the classification model, while the F1 score considers both precision and recall of the model. The kappa coefficient evaluates the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance. By considering these metrics, the study demonstrates that the BIA method performs superiorly and consistently compared to other band selection methods, indicating its effectiveness in accurately classifying moldy peanuts."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The band influence algorithm (BIA) was proposed as a novel band selection method for the classification of moldy, healthy, and damaged peanuts. In comparison to traditional band selection methods, the BIA method demonstrated superior classification accuracy and stability.\n\nThe BIA method was evaluated against five representative band selection methods using four classification models: decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and ShuffleNet V2. The experimental results showed that the BIA method outperformed the other methods on all classification models.\n\nSpecifically, when integrating the BIA method with ShuffleNet V2 and using 10 feature bands, the average accuracy, F1 score, and kappa coefficient of the classification reached 97.66%, 0.977, and 0.963, respectively. This indicates that the BIA method effectively extracted key features and removed redundancy, resulting in highly accurate and stable classification of moldy peanuts.\n\nTherefore, the BIA method can be considered as a superior approach for band selection in the classification of moldy peanuts using hyperspectral imaging, offering improved accuracy and stability compared to traditional methods."
