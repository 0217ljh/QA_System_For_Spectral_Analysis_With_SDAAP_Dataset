        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the detection performance to detect and monitor marine vessels, specifically fishing boats and yachts is the pixel-based probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR). The POD measures the percentage of correctly detected vessels out of the total number of vessels present in the images. The FAR measures the percentage of false alarms, or incorrectly detected vessels, out of the total number of detected vessels."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The estimated sizes of the vessels were compared to the digital mapping camera (DMC) images with resolutions of 0.10 m. The root-mean-square errors of the length and width of the vessels were approximately 1.19 m and 0.81 m, respectively. \n\nTo estimate the sizes of the vessels, the study applied the ellipse fitting method. This method involved extracting the boundaries of the vessels through a two-dimensional gradient and fitting an ellipse to these boundaries."
