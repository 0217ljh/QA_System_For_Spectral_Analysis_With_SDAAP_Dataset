        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction performance of the models in the related study was R2, RMSE, and RPD. An R2 value above 0.82 indicates a good model fit, while above 0.90 indicates excellent performance. RPD values between 2.5 and 3 indicate good predictability, and values greater than 3 indicate excellent prediction accuracy."
