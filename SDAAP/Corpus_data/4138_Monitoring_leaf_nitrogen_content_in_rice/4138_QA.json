        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of LNC estimation in the related study was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the LNC that can be explained by the model, with a higher value indicating a better fit. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted LNC values and the actual LNC values, with a lower value indicating a better fit.\n\nThe R-2 values obtained in this study ranged from 0.66 to 0.68, indicating that the models could explain approximately 66% to 68% of the variance in LNC. The RMSE values ranged from 11.45% to 11.96%, indicating that, on average, the predicted LNC values deviated from the actual values by approximately 11.45% to 11.96%.\n\nBased on these metrics, the study found that the fusion images from UAV multi-sensor imagery improved the accuracy of LNC estimation compared to using multispectral images alone."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In this study, machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods were used to estimate leaf nitrogen content (LNC) in rice using fusion images from different types of imagery acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). \n\nFirstly, fusion images were created by combining the simultaneously acquired digital RGB and multi-spectral images from UAV at three growth stages of rice. \n\nThen, the selecting methods of optimal features were coupled with machine learning algorithms to estimate LNC in rice using the fusion images. Different types of features, including bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs), were combined to improve the accuracy of the models. \n\nThe performance of the models using fusion images was compared to those using only multispectral images. It was found that the LNC estimation using fusion images was significantly improved compared to using multispectral images alone. \n\nTwo machine learning algorithms, Lasso Regression (LR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), were used in combination with feature selection methods. LR was used at the jointing stage and achieved an R-2 value of 0.66 and an RMSE of 11.96%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of fusion images from different types of imagery acquired by UAVs is shown to be more effective than traditional methods in estimating leaf nitrogen content (LNC) in rice crops. The study found that combining different types of features, such as bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs), improved the accuracy of the models. The fusion images outperformed multispectral images in estimating LNC, particularly at the jointing stage of rice growth. The use of machine learning algorithms, such as Lasso Regression (LR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), in combination with feature-screening methods further enhanced the estimation of LNC. The results indicated that the fusion of information from UAV multi-sensor imagery has a significant impact on improving crop LNC estimates, and the combination of multiple types of features has great potential for evaluating LNC in crops."
