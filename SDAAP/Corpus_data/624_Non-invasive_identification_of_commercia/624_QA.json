        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric used to discriminate green tea blends was classification accuracy. The accuracies for nonbagged tea were 90% and 93% for the benchtop and handheld spectrometers, respectively. For bagged tea, the accuracies were 93% for the benchtop spectrometer and 82% for the handheld spectrometer. "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The proposed methodology of using near-infrared spectroscopy and support vector machines can be applied in automatic quality control for green tea blends. The related study found that the classification accuracies using this methodology outperformed traditional methods such as partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for both handheld and tea inside teabag models. The results also showed that the benchtop spectrometer yielded superior classification performance for bagged tea compared to the handheld equipment. Therefore, the related study suggests that coupling NIR sensors and machine learning for data processing has the potential to be an effective approach for automatic quality control in the green tea industry."
