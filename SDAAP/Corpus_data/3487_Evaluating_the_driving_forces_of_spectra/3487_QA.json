        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the inversion results of water quality parameters was the goodness-of-fit (r(2)). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the measured values that can be explained by the inversion models. \n\nThe r(2) value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the inversion and measured values. Therefore, the higher the r(2) value, the more accurate the model is in predicting the water quality parameters."

The study used statistical regression models (SRMs) and various machine learning models (such as support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]) to analyze the differences between measured water quality parameters and the observed image spectra. The results showed that these models achieved good results in the inversions of Secchi depth and permanganate index."
