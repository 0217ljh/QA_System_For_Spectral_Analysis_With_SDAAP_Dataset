        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning models were utilized to improve the accuracy of species classification in grass pollen samples using FTIR spectroscopy. The models used were partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), artificial neural network, and random forest classifiers.\n\nFirst, the FTIR spectra of single pollen grains were obtained using FTIR microspectroscopy. These spectra were then preprocessed to suppress the influence of paraffin, which was used to embed the pollen samples. Two preprocessing methods were applied: non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) decomposition and extended multiplicative signal correction (EMSC) using a paraffin constituent spectrum.\n\nAfter preprocessing, the spectra were classified using a PLS-DA model. PLS-DA is a supervised machine learning algorithm that combines partial least square regression with discriminant analysis. It creates a model that maximizes the separation between different classes (in this case, different grass species) based on the spectral data.\n\nAdditionally, artificial neural network and random forest classifiers were also applied to the EMSC-corrected spectra. These are other types of machine learning algorithms that can handle complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the models, an independent validation was conducted. Spectra from unknown populations were assigned to the species"
