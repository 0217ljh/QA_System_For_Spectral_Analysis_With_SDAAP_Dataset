        "Output": "The proposed network in the study is called the improved 1D-VGG19-Inception-ResNet-A network. This network combines the advantages of the 1D-VGG19 network and the 1D-Inception-ResNet-V2 network.\n\nThe 1D-VGG19 network is known for its low time consumption, meaning it can process data quickly. On the other hand, the 1D-Inception-ResNet-V2 network is known for its high classification accuracy, meaning it can accurately classify data.\n\nThe improved 1D-VGG19-Inception-ResNet-A network takes advantage of these two networks by combining their strengths. It is designed to have low time consumption from the 1D-VGG19 network and high classification accuracy from the 1D-Inception-ResNet-V2 network.\n\nBy combining these advantages, the proposed network is able to achieve a significantly improved accuracy of rice freshness recognition, with an accuracy of 99.80%. This demonstrates that the network is effective in identifying the freshness of rice based on storage temperature using terahertz reflection imaging and deep learning algorithms."
