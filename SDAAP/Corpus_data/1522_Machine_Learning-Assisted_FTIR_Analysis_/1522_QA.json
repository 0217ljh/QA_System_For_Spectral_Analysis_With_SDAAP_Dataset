        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the proposed spectral biomarkers is the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiving Operator Curve (ROC) analysis. The AUC is a measure of the overall accuracy of a diagnostic test, with values ranging from 0 to 1. An AUC of 1 indicates a perfect test, while an AUC of 0.5 suggests a test with no discriminatory ability. \n\nIn this pilot study, the AUC value obtained for the proposed spectral biomarkers was 0.91, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.81-1.0. This indicates that the spectral biomarkers have a high accuracy in distinguishing between EVs extracted from sera of cancer patients and controls based on their mid-IR spectral response."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes,based on the findings of the pilot study, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) shows great potential as a method for distinguishing between extracellular vesicles (EVs) extracted from the sera of cancer patients and non-cancer subjects. The study found statistically significant differences in the integrated intensities of major mid-IR absorption bands, including carbohydrate and nucleic acids bands, protein amide I and II bands, and lipid CH stretching band. The diagnostic performances of the proposed spectral biomarkers, alone and combined, were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression followed by a Receiving Operator Curve analysis, obtaining large Areas Under the Curve (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-1.0). The study suggests that the discussed spectral biomarkers can outperform the classification ability of two widely used circulating HCC markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and protein induced by the absence of vitamin K or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II). Therefore, based on these findings, FTIR can be considered a superior method compared to traditional markers like AFP and PIVKA-II for distinguishing between EVs extracted from the sera of cancer patients and non-cancer subjects."
