        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in the related study was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the observed data that is explained by the model. In this case, it was used to assess how well the machine learning models trained with Sentinel-2 and HLS predictors were able to estimate selected plant functional traits.\n\nThe R-2 values obtained for chlorophyll and carotenoid content were 0.78 and 0.65, respectively. These values indicate that the models were able to explain 78% and 65% of the variance in the observed data for these traits. \n\nAs for how far this metric can go, the R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the model and the observed data. Therefore, the higher the R-2 value, the better the model's performance in explaining the variability in the data."
