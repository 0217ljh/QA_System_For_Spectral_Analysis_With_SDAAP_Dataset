        "Output": "The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm optimizes the input weights, hidden layer deviations, and hidden layer nodes of the extreme learning machine (ELM) network in the detection of the magnetic properties of haematite based on the IPSO-ELM algorithm and spectroscopy by introducing several enhancements.\n\nFirstly, the IPSO algorithm incorporates a linear decreasing inertia weight for the particle swarm, which helps in balancing exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. This allows the algorithm to effectively search the solution space and avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n\nSecondly, the IPSO algorithm takes into account the norm of the output weight in the particle update process. By considering the magnitude of the output weight, the algorithm can better adjust the particle positions and velocities, leading to improved convergence and accuracy in the optimization process.\n\nLastly, the IPSO algorithm utilizes the variation idea to change the length of the particle. This means that the algorithm dynamically adjusts the size of the particle based on its performance, allowing for better adaptability and stability in the optimization process.\n\nOverall, these enhancements in the IPSO algorithm contribute to better stability and generalization ability of the IPSO-ELM model in predicting the magnetic properties of haematite."
