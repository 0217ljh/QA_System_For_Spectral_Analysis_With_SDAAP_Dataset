        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, portable near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and multivariate analyses can be considered as superior methods compared to traditional methods for the rapid determination of fermentation duration (FmD), fermentation index (FI), pH, and moisture content (Mc) of cocoa beans. The past studydemonstrates that portable NIRS, combined with multivariate analysis techniques such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and partial least squares regression (PLS-R), can accurately predict and classify these quality attributes of cocoa beans. The use of portable NIRS allows for fast results (within 30 seconds) and can be performed on-site, making it a more efficient and convenient method compared to traditional laboratory-based wet chemistry techniques or table-top NIR spectroscopy. Additionally, the past study highlights the potential application of machine learning algorithms in combination with portable NIRS for real-time classification and quantification of cocoa bean quality parameters."
