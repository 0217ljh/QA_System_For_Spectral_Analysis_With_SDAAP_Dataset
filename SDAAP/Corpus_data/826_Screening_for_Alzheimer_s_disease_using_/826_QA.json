        "Output": "In the study investigating the detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease, the features were extracted from the resting-state fNIRS recordings by calculating the episode averaged standard deviation of the oxyhemoglobin concentration changes. These features were then used as input for a machine learning model called Support Vector Machine (SVM) for analysis."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the resting-state fNIRS recordings from a small number of prefrontal locations can be considered a promising and relatively less costly method for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study showed that using a high-density continuous-wave fNIRS system, lower hemodynamic activity in the prefrontal cortical areas was observed in patients with AD. Additionally, by analyzing the episode averaged standard deviation of the oxyhemoglobin concentration changes as features, the accuracy of subsets of optical channels in predicting the presence and severity of AD was significantly above chance. The sensitivity and specificity scores for detecting AD and its severity using <= 5 channels were also reported to be relatively high. These findings suggest that fNIRS is a viable technology for conveniently detecting and monitoring AD, potentially making it a superior method compared to traditional methods."
