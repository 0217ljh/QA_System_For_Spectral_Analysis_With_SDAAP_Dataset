        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of deep learning models, including 1D, 2D, and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP), was compared to the baseline results of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the classification of high-dimensional datasets produced by hyperspectral imaging for blood stain classification in forensic science.\n\nIn the transductive case, where both the training and test sets come from the same image, all models, including the MLP and SVM, showed comparative performance with no clear advantage of deep learning models. The overall accuracy range across all models was 98-100% for the easier image set.\n\nHowever, in the more challenging inductive case, where the test set is derived from a different image, deep learning architectures offered a significant advantage. The best overall accuracy of deep learning models in this case was in the range of 57-71%, improving the baseline set by the non-deep models (SVM) by up to 9 percentage points."
