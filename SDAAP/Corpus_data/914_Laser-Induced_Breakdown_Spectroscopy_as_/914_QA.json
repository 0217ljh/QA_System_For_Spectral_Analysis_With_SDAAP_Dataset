They used these algorithms in combination with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to distinguish among batches of soybean seeds of different physiological quality. The SVM method performed the best in discriminating among the batches, with the quadratic SVM function correctly classifying 100% of the high-vigor samples and 97.8% of the low-vigor samples."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and machine learning classification methods can be considered a superior and rapid method for identifying high-vigor soybean seeds among different batches based on their nutrient content, as demonstrated in the related study. The study showed that the SVM method, in particular, performed the best in discriminating among the batches, with the quadratic SVM function correctly classifying 100% of the high-vigor samples and 97.8% of the low-vigor samples. This indicates that the combination of LIBS and machine learning algorithms has the potential to accurately classify soybean seed batches according to their physiological quality."
