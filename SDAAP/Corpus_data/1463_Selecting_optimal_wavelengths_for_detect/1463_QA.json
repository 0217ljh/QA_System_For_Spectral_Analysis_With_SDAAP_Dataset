        "Output": "In the related study, three different machine learning techniques were implemented to classify tomatoes. The techniques used were Bayesian networks (BNs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs). These techniques were applied to the spectral data obtained from the multispectral imaging system. The performance of each technique was evaluated using a test set validation. The results showed that the best performance was achieved by the ANN technique, which achieved a classification accuracy of 95.0%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study determined that spectral difference features outperformed raw spectra features in terms of classification accuracy for detecting optimal wavelengths by comparing the performance of three different machine learning techniques (Bayesian networks, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines) on both types of features. The test set validation results showed that the machine learning techniques achieved higher classification accuracy when using spectral difference features compared to raw spectra features. This indicated the superiority of the SIMCA-aided CFS procedure, which selected the most informative wavelengths based on transmission differences between pairs of wavelengths in the obtained informative wavebands. The best performance, with a classification accuracy of 95.0%, was obtained by the artificial neural networks based on spectral difference features."
