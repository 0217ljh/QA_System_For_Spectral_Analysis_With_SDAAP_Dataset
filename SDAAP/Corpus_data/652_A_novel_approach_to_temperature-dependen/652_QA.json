The model was trained using the raw data of the absorption profiles obtained from milk samples that underwent various heat treatments with different times and temperatures. The random forest algorithm analyzed the absorption wavelengths and patterns in the data to identify characteristic features associated with different degrees of heat treatment. By comparing these features with the known classifications of the milk samples, the model was able to accurately classify new samples and determine the degree of heat treatment they had undergone. The accuracy of the random forest model was reported to be as high as 0.97, making it the best performing classifier among the other methods tested in the research."
