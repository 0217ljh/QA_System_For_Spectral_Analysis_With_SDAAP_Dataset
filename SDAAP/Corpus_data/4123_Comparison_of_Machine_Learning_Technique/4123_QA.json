        "Output": "The results of the study comparing different modeling techniques and feature selection techniques for inferring phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) from remote sensing data are as follows:\n\n1. SVM-RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination based on Support Vector Machine) was found to be more effective in selecting sensitive features.\n2. Random Forests (RF) performed better than Partial Least Square (PLS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in calibrating PSCs retrieval models.\n3. Machine learning techniques, including RF, produced better performance compared to the chlorophyll-a based three-component method.\n4. Sea surface temperature, wind stress, and spectral curvature derived from the remote sensing reflectance at 490, 510, and 555 nm were identified as among the most sensitive features to PSCs.\n5. The combination of SVM-RFE feature selection techniques and random forests regression was recommended as the most effective approach for inferring PSCs.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in selecting sensitive features and calibrating models for estimating PSCs using remote sensing data."
