        "Output": "The PLSDA-based cascading classification model contributes to the automatic separation of paper, cardboard, plastics, and multilayer packaging in the recycling of post-consumer packaging wastes by utilizing Near InfraRed (NIR) - HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) based methods, along with chemometrics and machine learning techniques. \n\nThis model allows for the recognition of polymeric fragments from cellulosic ones and the identification of multi-layer materials such as laminated plastic and laminated cardboard. By implementing this model, contaminants and composite materials can be systematically identified within plastic waste streams. \n\nThe model has been built to achieve a high level of prediction accuracy, with a Recognition and Reliability score of 0.933. This means that it can effectively detect and separate different types of packaging materials, contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the recycling process. \n\nOverall, the PLSDA-based cascading classification model provides an optimal, reliable, and low-cost solution for the automatic separation of various packaging materials, aiding in the recycling of post-consumer packaging wastes."
