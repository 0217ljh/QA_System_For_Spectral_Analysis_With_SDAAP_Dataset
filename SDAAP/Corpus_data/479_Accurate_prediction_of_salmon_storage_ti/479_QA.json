        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction performance of the models was the determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and prediction accuracy rate. The predictions were found to be highly accurate. At -18 degrees C, the R-2 of the test sets in the LSTM model was 0.9986, the RMSEP was 0.24, and the prediction accuracy rate was 96.5%. At 4 degrees C, the R-2, RMSEP, and accuracy were 0.9971, 0.24, and 95% respectively. At 20 degrees C, the R-2, RMSEP, and accuracy were 0.999, 0.06, and 100% respectively. These results indicate that the predictions made by the models were very accurate."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the evaluation of accuracy and adaptability under different temperature conditions, Raman spectroscopy combined with LSTM neural network can be considered a superior method for predicting the storage time and freshness of salmon meat compared to traditional methods. The results showed that the LSTM model had higher prediction performance and accuracy than traditional machine learning modeling methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) at all tested temperatures (-18 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and 20 degrees C). The determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSEP), and prediction accuracy rate were all significantly improved with the use of Raman spectroscopy and LSTM. Additionally, the combination of Raman spectroscopy and LSTM neural network allowed for quick, accurate, and non-destructive prediction of salmon freshness under different temperature conditions."
