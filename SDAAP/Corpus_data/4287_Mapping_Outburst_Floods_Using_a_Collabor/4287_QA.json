        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the end-of-flood map in the study was the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels in the map, while the Kappa coefficient measures the agreement between the predicted map and the reference map, taking into account the agreement that could occur by chance alone.\n\nAccording to the study, the overall accuracy of the end-of-flood map was 92.3%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.89. This indicates a high level of accuracy and agreement between the predicted map and the reference map."

Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space data\n2. Backscattering coefficient differences/ratio from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images\n3. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data\n4.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed flood mapping method using a combination of optical and SAR images, along with a DEM, has shown significant improvements compared to traditional methods in accurately delineating the full extent of outburst floods within a short timeframe. \n\nTraditionally, flood mapping using remote sensing images has focused on general flood events, and little attention has been given to outburst flood mapping. However, this study addresses the challenges posed by outburst floods, such as their short-duration nature and observation constraints from cloud cover.\n\nBy combining optical images from Sentinel-2, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1, and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), the proposed method overcomes these challenges. In the cloud-free region, the study found that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a threshold of 0.15 provided the best separation of the flooded area. In the cloud-covered region, an analysis of dual-polarization RGB false color composites images and backscattering coefficient differences of Sentinel-1 SAR data showed an apparent response to ground roughness changes caused by the flood."
