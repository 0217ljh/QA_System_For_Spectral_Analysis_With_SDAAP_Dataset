        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the inversion results for fine-grained nickel (Ni) grade inversion in the lateritic Ni mining area in North Konawe, Indonesia was the coefficient of determination (R-2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the Ni grade that can be explained by the spectral features and spatial information obtained from the remote sensing data. \n\nThe coefficient of determination (R-2) can range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the remote sensing data and the Ni grade. In the related study, the obtained R-2 value for the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method was 0.96, which indicates a strong correlation between the remote sensing data and the Ni grade. \n\nThe high R-2 value suggests that the GWR method is effective in accurately predicting and mapping the spatial distribution of Ni grades in the study area. It demonstrates the stability and accuracy of the GWR method compared to other models such as multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN)."
