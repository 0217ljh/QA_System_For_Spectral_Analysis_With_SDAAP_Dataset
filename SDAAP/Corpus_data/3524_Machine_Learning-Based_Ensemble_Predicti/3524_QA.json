        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate water-quality was the water-surface reflectance of incident solar radiation, which can be quantified utilizing wavelengths within the visible and near-infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, from approximately 350 to 1200 nm. This metric can help determine the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the water surface, which can be correlated with traditional in situ measurements and lab analyses to characterize variables such as Chl-a and TSS, providing an overall picture of water-quality."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The results of using canonical correlation analysis fusion as a method for water-based spectral analysis were superior to traditional methods. This approach helped overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data. Additionally, the use of machine learning regression techniques, such as multiple linear regression, partial least-squares regression, Gaussian process regression, support vector machine regression, and extreme learning machine regression, combined with decision-level fusion, proved to be effective for accurately modeling relationships between spectral reflectance and water-quality parameters. Feature-level fusion to spectral data for water-quality modeling was also evaluated and found to be successful."
