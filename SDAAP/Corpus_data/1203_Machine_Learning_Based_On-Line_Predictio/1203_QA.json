        "input": "",
        "Output": "The EPO-Cubist method outperforms the PDS-Cubist and OSC-Cubist methods in predicting SOC after removing the negative effect of SMC. The EPO-Cubist method shows considerable improvements in the prediction results of SOC, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.76, a ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 2.08, and a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.12%. In comparison, the PDS-Cubist and OSC-Cubist methods have lower prediction accuracy, with an R-2 of 0.55, an RPD of 1.24, and an RMSEP of 0.20% for the uncorrected on-line spectra. Therefore, the EPO-Cubist method is the most effective in accurately predicting SOC after correcting for the negative effect of SMC."
