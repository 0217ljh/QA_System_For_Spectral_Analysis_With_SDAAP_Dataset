        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, a combination of graph theory and semi-metric analysis was chosen to characterize the four recurring connectivity states derived from the dynamic functional connectivity (FC) measured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The metric used in this analysis was not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, the study focused on extracting occurrence probability and state transition as dynamic FC network features, which were used as biomarkers of emotional sensitivity. Therefore, it can be inferred that the chosen metric was related to the occurrence probability and state transition of the dynamic FC states."

        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly stated whether the proposed analytical framework using dynamic task-based functional connectivity (FC) features as biomarkers of emotional sensitivity in nursing students can be applied to other healthcare professions. The study specifically focused on nursing students and registered nurses, and it is unclear if the findings and methodology can be generalized to other healthcare professions. Further research would be needed to determine the applicability of this framework to other healthcare professions."
