The researchers collected a total of 600 soil samples from the Western Plateau of Sao Paulo and analyzed them using DRS. The color data obtained from the samples were then analyzed using the RGB system in a computer program.\n\nThe samples were also photographed to capture the soil color information. The soil samples were further subjected to laboratory analysis to quantify the contents of various mineralogical attributes such as crystalline and noncrystalline Fe, hematite, goethite, kaolinite, and gibbsite.\n\nThe collected data, including the soil color information obtained through DRS and MPS, along with the quantified mineralogical attributes, were used to create a robust database. This database was then subjected to the random forest machine learning algorithm, along with geostatistics.\n\nBy utilizing the random forest algorithm, the researchers were able to train the machine learning model to estimate the mineralogical attributes based on the RGB system obtained through DRS and MPS. This allowed them to construct detailed maps of the mineralogical attributes in the study area.\n\nThe use of machine learning techniques,"
