        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to detect and map salmon spawning locations (redds) along a large, gravel-bed river was the mapping accuracy. The study found that the mapping accuracy for identifying salmon redds using RGB imagery ranged from approximately 0.75 to greater than 0.9, depending on the classification algorithm used. The mapping accuracy for identifying redds using hyperspectral imagery ranged from approximately 0.86 to greater than 0.9, again depending on the classification algorithm used. Therefore, the metric of mapping accuracy can go up to approximately 0.9 in terms of accuracy for salmon redd detection in this study."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "To detect and map salmon spawning locations (redds) along a large, gravel-bed river, machine learning classification and object detection techniques were applied to UAS-based imagery in order to detect salmon redds. Specifically, logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM) classification algorithms were used for the detection of salmon redds in the RGB imagery. Additionally, object-based image analysis (OBIA) was employed for the detection of redds in the hyperspectral imagery."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, spectrally based remote sensing using data acquired from unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can be considered superior to traditional methods for detecting and mapping salmon spawning locations (redds) along a large, gravel-bed river. The study developed a novel, semi-automated approach for detecting salmon redds by applying machine learning classification and object detection techniques to UAS-based imagery. The results showed that both true color (RGB) and hyperspectral imagery could be used to identify salmon redds, with varying degrees of accuracy. However, the hyperspectral imagery was found to be more useful and effective in identifying salmon spawning locations than RGB images. The hyperspectral imagery provided higher accuracies for mapping salmon redds, and also yielded complementary physical habitat information such as water depth and substrate composition. This suggests that spectrally based remote sensing using UAS data can provide more accurate and comprehensive information for studying river ecosystems and mapping salmon spawning locations compared to traditional methods."
