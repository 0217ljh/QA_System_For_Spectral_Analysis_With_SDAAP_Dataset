        "Output": "Yes, the proposed methodology using a resolution enhancement technique coupled with non-negative matrix factorization can be considered superior to traditional methods for mapping minerals with low abundances and fine structures in hyperspectral imaging of drill-cores. The methodology allows for the production of mineral maps at higher spatial resolutions, which improves the mapping of minerals and provides better details in alteration patterns such as veins. Additionally, it overcomes the limitation of low spatial sampling in hyperspectral sensors, allowing for the mapping of minerals that were previously hidden in the data. This non-destructive technique, combined with adapted machine learning algorithms, offers a robust and accurate analysis of drill-core hyperspectral data, making it a valuable tool in mineral exploration campaigns."
