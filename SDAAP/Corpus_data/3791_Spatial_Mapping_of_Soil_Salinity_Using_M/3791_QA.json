When using the Differential Vegetation Index (DVI), the Random Forest Regressor achieved an R2 of 0.94, MAE of 1.42 dS/m, MSE of 3.58 dS/m, and RMSE of 1.89 dS/m. Alternatively, when using the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Random Forest Regressor achieved an R2 of 0.93, MAE of 1.46 dS/m, MSE of 3.90 dS/m, and RMSE of 1.97 dS/m. These results indicate that the Random Forest Regressor provided the most accurate predictions of soil salinity in Kot Addu compared to the other machine learning regression models."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of spectral feature processing methods with Landsat 8 data and machine learning regression models can be considered superior to traditional methods for spatially mapping soil salinity in Kot Addu, Pakistan. The related study utilized advanced machine learning regression models, such as Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Partial Least Squares Regression, and Ridge Regressor, along with spectral data from Landsat 8 to map soil salinity. The results showed that the Random Forest Regressor outperformed the other models in terms of prediction accuracy. This indicates that remote sensing technology combined with machine learning models is an efficient method for assessing soil salinity at local scales. The use of these methods allows for quicker and more cost-effective estimation of soil salinity levels, enabling effective resource allocation and providing early warnings regarding soil salinity to mitigate osmotic stress and minimize the risk of soil erosion."
