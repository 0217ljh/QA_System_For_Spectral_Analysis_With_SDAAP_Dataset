        "Output": "Machine learning techniques were applied in the study to identify and quantify low levels of organic contaminants in water by using the patented simultaneous absorbance-transmittance excitation-emission matrix (A-TEEM) instrument method. The study involved creating a software library with the signature excitation and emission matrixes of each type of oil or their indicator organic compounds. The machine learning algorithms were then trained on this library to recognize and classify different types of oil compounds present in the water samples. By analyzing the absorbance and transmittance data obtained from the A-TEEM instrument, the machine learning models were able to detect and quantify the low levels of organic contaminants in the water, even in the presence of a higher background of other dissolved organic matter components. This approach showed potential for alerting plant operators to organic contamination events in waterworks."

The study aimed to enter the excitation and emission matrix of each type of oil or their indicator organic compounds into the instrument's software library. This suggests that the instrument and analysis method are capable of identifying and quantifying low levels of organic contaminants, including different types of oil compounds, in waterworks' source and treated water."
