The RP^2 and Rp^2 values were reported as 0.9237 and 0.9216, respectively. \n\nThe R^2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and actual values. Therefore, the chosen metric can go up to a maximum value of 1. In this study, the achieved RP^2 and Rp^2 values of 0.9237 and 0.9216 indicate a high level of prediction accuracy for both TSS and TA in grapes."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The advantages of using deep learning-based stacked auto-encoders (SAE) algorithm compared to other machine learning models in estimating TSS and TA in grapes using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique are:\n\n1. Feature extraction: SAE algorithm is capable of automatically learning and extracting deep spectral features from pixel-level spectra. This allows for more effective representation of the data, potentially capturing more complex patterns and relationships compared to other models.\n\n2. Non-linearity: Deep learning models like SAE can handle non-linear relationships between input features and output variables. This is particularly useful in the case of TSS and TA estimation in grapes, where the relationship between spectral information and quality properties may not be linear.\n\n3. Size compensation: The SAE-LSSVM model with size compensation takes into account the size of fruits as a compensation factor. This helps in improving the accuracy of prediction by considering the influence of fruit size on TSS and TA estimation.\n\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages of using SAE algorithm compared to other machine learning models:\n\n1. Data requirements: Deep learning models typically require a large amount of training data to perform well. Collecting and labeling a sufficient amount of hyperspectral data for training the SAE model can be time-consuming and expensive.\n\n2. Computational"

        "Output": "The SAE-LSSVM model with size compensation outperformed traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy for TSS and TA in grapes using the HSI technique. The optimal prediction accuracy was achieved by the SAE-LSSVM model, with RP2=0.9237 and RMSEP = 0.5041% for TSS, and Rp2=0.9216 and RMSEP = 0.1091 g L-1 for TA. These results indicate that the SAE-LSSVM model with size compensation provided more accurate predictions compared to conventional wavelength selection approaches."
