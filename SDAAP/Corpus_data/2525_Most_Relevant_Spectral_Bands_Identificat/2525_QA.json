        "Output": "Yes, the proposed methodology based on genetic algorithm optimization can be used to improve the accuracy of tumor identification in brain cancer detection using hyperspectral images in the VNIR region. The results of the study showed that the methodology slightly improved the accuracy of tumor identification by approximately 5% compared to the reference results. This improvement was achieved by identifying the most relevant wavelengths and using the lowest possible number of spectral bands. The identified spectral ranges can be used to develop customized acquisition sensors that could provide real-time hyperspectral imaging for brain cancer detection."
