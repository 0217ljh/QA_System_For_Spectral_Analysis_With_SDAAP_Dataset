        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the shelf life of Phlebopus portentosus is freshness. The freshness of the mushrooms is evaluated based on the number of days they have been stored at 0-2 degrees Celsius. The samples are divided into three categories: category I (1-2 days), category II (3-4 days), and category III (5-6 days). The metric of freshness can determine whether the mushrooms are recommended for consumption or not."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the fast and reliable method for identifying the shelf life of Phlebopus portentosus mushrooms using FT-NIR spectroscopy, machine learning models were utilized. Specifically, a deep learning classification model, traditional support vector machine (SVM), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and an extreme learning machine (ELM) model were established. These machine learning models were used to analyze the data obtained from the FT-NIR spectroscopy and classify the mushrooms into different categories based on their freshness. The results showed that the deep learning model combined with FT-NIR two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) was the most suitable and robust method for identifying the shelf life of the mushrooms."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of FT-NIR spectroscopy and machine learning models can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for identifying the shelf life of Phlebopus portentosus mushrooms. The related study states that this method is fast, nondestructive, and highly accurate in identifying the shelf life of the mushrooms. It also mentions that the deep learning model combined with FT-NIR spectroscopy had the best robustness among the tested models. Therefore, this method shows promise as a rapid analysis tool for quickly identifying the shelf life of fresh edible mushrooms."
