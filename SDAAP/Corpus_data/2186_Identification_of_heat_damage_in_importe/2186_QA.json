        "Output": "The study demonstrates the superiority of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology over traditional methods in distinguishing sound soybeans from heat-damaged soybeans through several key findings. \n\nFirstly, the study utilized five different preprocessing methods to enhance the performance of the models. This indicates that HSI technology can effectively preprocess the original spectra of soybeans, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the classification process.\n\nSecondly, the study proposed three waveband selection algorithms based on neighborhood rough set (NRS) theory. These algorithms identified the optimal waveband subsets with the highest distinguishing ability, addressing the challenge of high-dimensional HSI data. This suggests that HSI technology can effectively select the most relevant wavebands for classification, enhancing the interpretability of the models.\n\nFurthermore, the study validated the effectiveness of the preprocessing methods and waveband selection algorithms by establishing two models: extreme learning machine (ELM) and random forest (RF) models. The results showed that the combination of the Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing preprocessing method, the mutual information (MI-NRS) waveband selection algorithm, and the ELM classifier achieved the best classification and robustness results. This demonstrates that HSI technology, when combined with appropriate preprocessing methods and waveband selection algorithms, outperforms traditional"
