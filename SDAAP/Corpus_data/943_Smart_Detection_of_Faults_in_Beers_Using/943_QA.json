        "Output": "The machine learning models in the proposed integrated AI system for smart detection of beer faults were developed using different inputs. Model 1 (M1) and Model 2 (M2) were developed using the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) absorbance values and the electronic nose (e-nose) sensor readings as inputs, respectively. M1 used 100 inputs from the NIR absorbance values ranging from 1596-2396 nm, while M2 used nine sensor readings from the e-nose.\n\nModel 3 (M3) and Model 4 (M4) were based on the NIR absorbance values, and Model 5 (M5) and Model 6 (M6) were based on the e-nose sensor readings as inputs. All four models (M3, M4, M5, and M6) used the 19 aroma profiles as targets.\n\nThe inputs for the machine learning models were the measurements obtained from the NIR absorbance values and the e-nose sensor readings, while the targets were the 19 aroma profiles representing different beer faults and the control aroma."
