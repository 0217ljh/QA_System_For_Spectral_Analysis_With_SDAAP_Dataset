        "Output": "Yes, the linear discriminant analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) methods used in this study can be considered superior to traditional methods for discriminating between grass-fed and non grass-fed milks based on mid-infrared (MIR) spectra. These machine-learning statistical analysis methods demonstrated a greater level of accuracy for predicting cow diet from MIR spectra compared to traditional methods such as auditing and inspection of farm records."
