        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral features of cannabis fields and other plants in areas where cannabis is produced in northern Turkey can be accurately distinguished using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. The related study used high-resolution imagery from PlanetScope satellites and applied machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF), to classify cannabis fields. The classification results showed that cannabis fields can be accurately classified with an accuracy higher than 93%. Therefore, the investigations with machine learning techniques showed promising results for distinguishing cannabis fields from other plants in the area."
