        "Output": "The study's finding that the CNN method outperformed other classifiers in spectral analysis supports the purpose of investigating the early detection of excess nitrogen application in tomato leaves using a non-destructive hyperspectral imaging system by providing a more accurate and reliable method for detection. \n\nThe goal of the study was to detect excess nitrogen application in tomato leaves, as incorrect nitrogen usage can negatively impact the quality of tomato fruit. By using a non-destructive hyperspectral imaging system, the researchers aimed to identify the early signs of excess nitrogen application without damaging the plants.\n\nThe study compared the performance of different machine learning classifiers, including classic supervised classifiers, hybrid artificial neural network classifiers, and classifiers based on deep learning algorithms. The results showed that the CNN method had the highest correct classification rate (CCR) of 91.6%, outperforming the other classifiers.\n\nThis finding is significant because it suggests that the CNN method is more effective in accurately detecting excess nitrogen application in tomato leaves compared to other techniques. By using CNN architectures, remote sensing can be utilized for precise detection of excessive nitrogen fertilizer use in large areas.\n\nOverall, the study's finding supports the purpose of the investigation by providing evidence that the CNN method is the preferred choice for spectral analysis in detecting excess nitrogen application."
