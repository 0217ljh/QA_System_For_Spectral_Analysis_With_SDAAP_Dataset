        "Output": "The multi-task deep learning framework aims to address the challenge of each modality capturing a different location of the 3D objects in multi-spectral images. This is in contrast to typical multi-spectral imaging scenarios where all image bands observe the same scene. The framework exploits the dependencies between image bands to produce 3D AR localization (segmentation and detection) where different image bands (and physical locations) have their own set of results. Additionally, the framework addresses the difficulty of producing dense AR annotations for training supervised machine learning algorithms by adapting a training strategy based on weak labels (bounding boxes) in a recursive manner."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The multi-task deep learning framework outperforms traditional methods in accurately localizing solar Active Regions (AR) from multi-spectral images. The framework exploits the dependencies between image bands to produce 3D AR localization, taking into account the different locations captured by each modality. This approach is particularly effective in the multi-layer multi-spectral scenario, where each image band observes a different scene.\n\nThe framework also addresses the challenge of producing dense AR annotations for training supervised machine learning algorithms by adapting a training strategy based on weak labels (bounding boxes) in a recursive manner. This strategy helps overcome the difficulty of obtaining precise annotations for training data.\n\nIn comparison to baseline approaches for solar image analysis (such as multi-channel coronal hole detection and SPOCA for ARs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods (like Faster RCNN and U-Net), the multi-task deep learning framework achieves higher performance in both detection and segmentation stages. It achieves an average Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.72 for segmentation and an F1 score of 0.90 for detection across all modalities."
