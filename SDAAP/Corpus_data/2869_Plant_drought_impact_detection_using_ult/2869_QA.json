        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the accuracy of drought detection in the related study was overall accuracy. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. In the related study, the overall accuracy of the deep learning model using derivative spectra was reported to be up to 97.5% and 100%. Therefore, the metric of overall accuracy can go up to 100% in the related study."

        "Output": "The use of full spectra and derivative spectra integrated with advanced machine learning algorithms outperforms traditional spectral index-based methods in terms of early drought detection and classification. According to the study, the results showed that the deep learning model, combined with full spectra and derivative spectra, allowed accurate drought detection with an overall accuracy of up to 97.5% and 100%. In contrast, spectral indices and spectral index models either failed to detect early stress or could detect early stress but with much lower accuracy. This indicates that the integration of deep learning and hyperspectral data offers significant improvements in detecting and classifying drought stress at an early stage."
