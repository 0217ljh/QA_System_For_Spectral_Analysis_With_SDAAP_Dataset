However, it does mention that the classification accuracy obtained for the deep learning systems was 98.1% and 94.4% for data in the signal and spectral domains, respectively, compared to an accuracy of 97.2% and 87.2% evaluated by the SVM method. This suggests that the metric used to evaluate the classification accuracy could be the percentage of correctly classified instances.\n\nAs for how far this metric can go, the text does not provide any information on the upper limit or the maximum achievable accuracy. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how far this metric can go based on the given information."

The deep learning systems achieved an accuracy of 98.1% and 94.4% in the signal and spectral domains, respectively, compared to an accuracy of 97.2% and 87.2% achieved by the SVM method. This indicates that the deep learning systems outperformed the traditional methods in accurately classifying the observations."
