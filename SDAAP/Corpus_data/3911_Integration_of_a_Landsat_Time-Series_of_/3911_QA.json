The researchers utilized the Random Forest algorithm, which showed the highest accuracy with a model performance of R-2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 0.059. Support vector machines and neural networks were also employed and demonstrated high performance with R-2 values greater than 0.7. These machine learning algorithms were trained using a Landsat time series and the physically-based distributed hydrological model (WiMMed) to identify the correlations between defoliation rates and spectral indices such as the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Moisture Stress Index (MSI)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study's findings on the correlations between the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Moisture Stress Index (MSI) with defoliation rates contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the mortality processes of Pinus pinaster plantations and the hydrological regime in the Mediterranean climate by highlighting the importance of these spectral indices in assessing the health and vulnerability of the plantations. The high correlations observed between NBR, MSI, and defoliation rates suggest that these indices can serve as indicators of the stress levels and overall condition of the plantations. This information can be valuable for monitoring and managing the impacts of climate change on Mediterranean coniferous plantations. Additionally, the study's use of machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, support vector machines, and neural networks, further enhances the understanding of the complex relationships between hydrological variables and defoliation processes. By identifying the key hydrological variables, such as potential evapotranspiration, winter precipitation, and maximum summer temperature, the study provides insights into the specific factors that contribute to the vulnerability and mortality of Pinus pinaster plantations in the Mediterranean climate."
