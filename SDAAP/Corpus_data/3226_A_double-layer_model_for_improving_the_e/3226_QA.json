        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the models in the related study is the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the predicted variable that can be explained by the independent variables. The RMSE and MAE values quantify the average difference between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating higher accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of spectral features (SFs) and texture features (TFs) can improve the accuracy of estimating winter wheat LAI, CPP, and CNC using high-precision UAV multispectral imagery. The results of the related study showed that the inversion of LAI, CPP, and CNC using SFs+TFs greatly improved the estimation accuracy compared to using only SFs. The double-layer models, which incorporated both SFs and TFs as inputs, performed better in estimating winter wheat CNC compared to the direct inversion models. The best accuracy for winter wheat CNC was achieved by the double-layer radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model with SFs+TFs as inputs."
