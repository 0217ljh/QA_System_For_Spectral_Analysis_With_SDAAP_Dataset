        "Output": "Combining the nonlinear variable selection method with optimized RF regression improves the efficiency of aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation for forest management and monitoring in coniferous forests using remote sensing technology in the following ways:\n\n1. Improved accuracy: The related study found that the nonlinear indices (Kendall's tau coefficient, Spearman coefficient, distance correlation coefficient, and the importance index) provided significantly lower estimation errors compared to the linear index (Pearson correlation coefficient). This suggests that the nonlinear variable selection method can better capture the complex relationships between the spectral variables, land surface temperature (LST), soil moisture, and AGB in coniferous forests.\n\n2. Reduced estimation errors: The optimized RF regressions, incorporating the nonlinear variable selection method, resulted in lower root mean square error (RMSE) values for AGB estimation. The importance index, in particular, achieved the minimum RMSE of 40.92 Mg/ha. This indicates that the nonlinear variable selection method can effectively identify the most important variables for AGB estimation, leading to more accurate predictions.\n\n3. Enhanced model performance: The inclusion of LST and soil moisture as variables in the optimized RF regressions significantly improved AGB estimation."
