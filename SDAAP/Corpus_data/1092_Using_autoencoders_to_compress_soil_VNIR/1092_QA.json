According to the text, when compared to standard pre-processing techniques and transformations such as the principal components space, the proposed methodology using only one spectral source as input decreases the root mean square error (RMSE) on average by 8.4% and by 3.5%, respectively. Additionally, when compared to a multi-input convolutional neural network, which was recently proposed and outperformed other methodologies, the results of the proposed multi-input methodology exhibit an average RMSE decrease of 9.9%. Therefore, the proposed methodology using stacked autoencoders shows significant improvements in accuracy compared to traditional techniques and transformations."
