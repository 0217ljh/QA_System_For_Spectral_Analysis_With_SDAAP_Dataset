        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate soil characteristics was the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE values were used to compare the accuracy of the estimated soil properties with the actual values. The study found that the ML algorithms, specifically MLP-UAV networks and MLP-S2A networks, provided improvements in the RMSE values for different soil characteristics. The RMSE values improved between 23.23% and 35.66% for sand, silt, and soil organic matter content in MLP-UAV networks, while the MLP-S2A networks provided 9.73% to 19.85% improvement for pH, clay, and soil moisture. The UAV-based GBDT ML algorithms were even more successful, with relative improvements ranging from 12.16% to 93.66% for pH, sand, silt, CaCO3, and soil moisture. Therefore, the RMSE metric was used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation models, and the study showed significant improvements in estimation accuracy using the ML algorithms and sensor technology."
