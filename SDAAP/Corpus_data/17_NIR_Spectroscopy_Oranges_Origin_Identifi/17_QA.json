The conclusion specifically states that the framework was used to identify the origin of oranges and achieved a high accuracy rate of 92.8%. However, it does not mention whether the framework has been tested or applied to other fruits or agricultural products. Therefore, it is unclear whether the framework can be directly applied to other items without further research or modifications."
