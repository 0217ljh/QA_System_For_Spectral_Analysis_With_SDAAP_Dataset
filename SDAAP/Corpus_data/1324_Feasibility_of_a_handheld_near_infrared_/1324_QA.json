The models were able to correctly identify blood in 94% of cases with a false positive rate of 14% for blood-like samples."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models were used in the investigation of the handheld near-infrared spectrometer for the identification of deposited bloodstains by conducting a calibration process. Over 500 positive (blood present) and negative (blood absent) samples were scanned using the spectrometer to create a dataset for training the predictive models. These models were developed based on machine learning principles using the collected data.\n\nAfter the calibration, the models were tested on over 100 new positive and negative samples to evaluate their performance. The purpose of this testing was to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the models in correctly classifying deposited stains as blood. The results showed that all tested models were able to classify the stains as blood with at least 81% accuracy, and some models achieved even higher classification accuracy of over 94%.\n\nThis investigation demonstrated that the handheld near-infrared spectrometer, combined with machine learning models, has the potential to be a rapid, low-cost, and non-destructive method for screening body fluids at crime scenes, specifically for the identification of bloodstains."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the high classification accuracy achieved by the tested models using the handheld near-infrared spectrometer can be considered superior to traditional methods for the specific identification of deposited bloodstains. The text states that all models tested were able to correctly classify deposited stains as blood in at least 81% of tested samples, with some models allowing for even higher classification accuracy at over 94%. This suggests that the handheld near-infrared devices have the potential to offer a more accurate and reliable method for identifying bloodstains compared to traditional methods such as chemical reagents or alternative light sources. Additionally, the handheld near-infrared spectrometer offers the advantages of being rapid, low cost, and non-destructive, making it a promising tool for criminal investigation."
