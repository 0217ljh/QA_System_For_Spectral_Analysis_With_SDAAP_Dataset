        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study was the prediction accuracy, measured by the coefficient of determination (R-2). This metric assesses the proportion of the variance in the cheese-making traits that can be explained by the predictive models. The study found that the stacking ensemble learning technique, which combines multiple base learners, improved the prediction accuracy by 3% to 31% for traditional milk coagulation properties (MCP), 2% to 26% for curd firming traits (CFt), 1% to 38% for cheese yield (CY) traits, and 2% to 27% for milk nutrient recovery in the curd (REC) traits compared to the individual base learners. Therefore, the stacking ensemble method significantly enhanced the predictive ability of the models for cheese-making traits."

        "Output": "The AfiLab real-time milk analyzer was integrated with the stacking ensemble learning technique by using the near-infrared AfiLab spectral data and on-farm information (such as days in milk and parity) as inputs. The stacking ensemble learning technique combined different statistical methods, including elastic net (EN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural network (ANN), which were considered as base learners. \n\nThe predictive ability of these base learners was assessed using cross-validation scenarios. The statistical methods were trained on the collected data and samples for wet-laboratory analyses from 499 Holstein cows. The traits of interest were 9 milk coagulation traits (3 milk coagulation properties and 6 curd firming traits) and 7 cheese-making traits (3 cheese yield traits and 4 milk nutrient recovery in the curd traits).\n\nThe results showed that including information on the cows (days in milk and parity) in the AfiLab infrared prediction improved its accuracy compared to using near-infrared AfiLab alone. The stacking ensemble method further improved prediction accuracy for all traits compared to the individual base learners. The ANN approach was found to be the most accurate base learner, and the stacking ensemble method improved prediction accuracy by"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the integration of the AfiLab real-time milk analyzer with the stacking ensemble learning technique can be considered a superior alternative to traditional methods for monitoring the technological quality of milk and cheese-making traits in Holstein cattle. The study found that by including information on the cows (days in milk and parity) in the AfiLab infrared prediction, the accuracy of predicting milk coagulation traits, curd firming traits, cheese yield traits, and milk nutrient recovery traits increased significantly compared to using near-infrared AfiLab alone. The stacking ensemble learning technique, which combines multiple statistical methods as base learners, further improved the prediction accuracy for these traits. The stacking ensemble method showed improvements ranging from 3% to 38% compared to the individual base learners. Overall, the results suggest that integrating the AfiLab real-time milk analyzer with the stacking ensemble learning technique provides a robust and effective approach for daily monitoring of milk and cheese-making traits in Holstein cattle."
