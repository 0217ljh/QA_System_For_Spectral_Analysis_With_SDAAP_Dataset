        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, we can infer that the high and similar correlation between the spectral indices and measured SMC values for both S2 and L8 data suggests that spectroscopic methods using optical satellite imagery have the potential to be effective for estimating soil moisture content (SMC) over cropland areas."
