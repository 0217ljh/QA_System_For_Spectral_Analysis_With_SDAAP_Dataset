The overall accuracy is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification algorithms, which measures the percentage of correctly classified instances.\n\nAs for how far this metric can go,the overall accuracy of the ensemble of MLAs (Linear Discriminant Analysis with Decision Tree Classifier and LDA with Support Vector Machine) was 88 \u5364 8%. This indicates that the ensemble had an average accuracy of 88%, with a variation of \u5364 8%."

        "Output": "The performance of the MLA ensembles in classifying Raman spectroscopy (RS) data is superior to traditional methods in predicting oral cancer risk. The results of the past study showed that when the RS of oral epithelial cells from different study groups (normal-healthy volunteers, potentially cancerable leucoplakia, and cancer patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma) were classified using the MLA ensembles, the overall accuracy was 88% with a deviation of 8%. \n\nIn comparison, when the Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) was applied individually, the overall accuracy was only 48% with a deviation of 19%. Similarly, when the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied individually, the overall accuracy was 58% with a deviation of 15%. \n\nFurthermore, the class-wise evaluation demonstrated that the LDA-SVM ensemble outperformed the LDA-DTC ensemble in terms of performance. \n\nTo assess the classifier ensembles' performance in cancer risk prediction, a blind test was conducted using RS data from habitual cigarette smokers (CS) as the susceptible group and healthy volunteers as the control group. The LDA-SVM ensemble showed the highest classification accuracy, indicating its ability to accurately detect oral cancer risk and screen susceptible patients. \n\nTherefore, the"
