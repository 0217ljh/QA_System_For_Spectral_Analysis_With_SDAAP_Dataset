        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the synergistic use of geodiversity and multi-seasonal remotely sensed features can provide higher accuracy for estimating plant diversity in a rangeland in southwest Iran compared to traditional methods. The related study used geodiversity variables (topographic and soil variables) and multi-seasonal remote-sensing-based features to estimate plant diversity. The results indicated that this approach provided the highest accuracy for measuring plant diversity indices such as Shannon's and Simpson's indices, species richness, and vegetation cover. The accuracy achieved with this approach (R-2 up to 0.57) was higher compared to using a single model for each date (February, April, and July). Therefore, the use of geodiversity and multi-seasonal remotely sensed features can be considered a more effective method for estimating plant diversity in this specific rangeland in southwest Iran."
