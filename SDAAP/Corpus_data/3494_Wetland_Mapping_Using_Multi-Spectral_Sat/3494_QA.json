This metric measures the average accuracy across all classes. \n\nAccording to the related study, the proposed CNN architecture outperformed GoogleNet and SqueezeNet by about 12.71% and 12.2% in terms of mean overall accuracy, respectively. This indicates that the proposed CNN method significantly improved the accuracy of wetland classification compared to these other models."
