        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the filter-based feature selection methods used in the related study can potentially be applied to other highly correlated, feature-rich datasets from hyperspectral remote sensing data. The study found that for some combinations of learners and feature sets, filter methods achieved better predictive performances than using no feature selection. This suggests that filter methods have the potential to be helpful in high-dimensional situations and can improve the interpretation of feature effects in fitted models."
