        "Output": "Yes, the use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) coupled with the kernel extreme learning machine (K-ELM) method and particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be considered superior to traditional methods for rapid analysis of coal properties. This is supported by the results of the study mentioned in the related study, which showed that the developed models using LIBS, K-ELM, and PSO had high prediction abilities for ash content, volatile matter content, and calorific value of coal. The models achieved low root mean squared error of cross-validation (RMSECV) values and high correlation coefficients of cross-validation (R-CV) and prediction (R-P). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for rapid analysis of coal properties, suggesting its superiority over traditional methods."
