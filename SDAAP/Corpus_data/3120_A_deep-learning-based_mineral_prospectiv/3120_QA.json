        "Output": "The SA-BPNN model, which stands for self-attention back-propagation neural network, plays a crucial role in the proposed mineral prospectivity modeling workflow for porphyry-epithermal deposits in mineral exploration. This deep-learning framework is designed to automatically explore relationships among diverse features and enhance the capability of information extraction.\n\nBy utilizing quantitative data obtained from hyperspectral remote sensing, geochemistry, and geophysics, the SA-BPNN model, along with the SVM and U-Net models, predicts ore-prospecting targets. The SA-BPNN model specifically contributes to this process by leveraging its self-attention mechanism to identify important features and patterns within the data. This allows for more accurate and efficient identification of potential mineralization areas.\n\nThe performance of the SA-BPNN model in mineral prospectivity modeling is compared with alternative methods, such as SVM and U-Net. The results show that the SA-BPNN model occupies 1.40% of the study area and contains 100% of the known Cu-Au mineralization in the Duolong ore district in Tibet. This indicates that the SA-BPNN model outperforms the other models in accurately identifying mineralization targets.\n\nOverall, the SA-BPNN model significantly contributes to the proposed"

        "Output": "Yes, the SA-BPNN method can be considered superior to alternative methods for mineral prospectivity modeling based on the performance evaluation in the Duolong ore district in Tibet. According to the provided information, the SA-BPNN model achieved a model-based prediction that occupied 1.40% of the study area and contained 100% of the known Cu-Au mineralization in the Duolong ore district. This indicates that the SA-BPNN method outperformed the SVM and U-Net models, which occupied 1.73% and 2.21% of the study area, respectively, and contained 100% and 80% of the known Cu-Au mineralization. Therefore, the SA-BPNN method demonstrated superior performance in accurately predicting mineral prospectivity in the Duolong ore district compared to the alternative methods."
