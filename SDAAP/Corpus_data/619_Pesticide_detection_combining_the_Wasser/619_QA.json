        "Output": "The proposed WGAN-ResNet method addresses the limitation of insufficient learning samples in analyzing terahertz spectroscopy for detecting carbendazim residue by combining two deep learning networks, the Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) and the residual neural network (ResNet). \n\nThe WGAN is used to generate more new learning samples, thereby increasing the size of the training dataset. This helps to overcome the problem of insufficient samples by creating synthetic data that can be used for training the ResNet. By generating additional samples, the WGAN ensures that the ResNet has a larger and more diverse set of data to learn from, improving its ability to detect carbendazim residue accurately.\n\nAdditionally, pretraining model technology is employed to reduce the training parameters of the ResNet. This helps to avoid overfitting, which can occur when a model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By reducing the training parameters, the ResNet is able to generalize better and make more accurate predictions on unseen terahertz spectroscopy data.\n\nBy combining the WGAN for generating more samples and the ResNet with reduced training parameters, the proposed WGAN-ResNet method effectively addresses the limitation of insufficient learning samples in analyzing terahertz spectro"
