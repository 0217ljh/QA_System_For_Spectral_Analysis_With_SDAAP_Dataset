        "Output": "In the research on establishing a non-destructive classification method for hybrid and female parent seeds in hybrid wheat production, both transmittance and reflectance spectra were used. However, the transmittance spectrum was found to significantly improve the classification of hybrids and female parents compared to the reflectance spectrum."

        "Output": "The metric chosen in the study was the transmittance spectrum obtained through hyperspectral imaging technology. This metric was found to significantly improve the classification of hybrid and female parent seeds compared to the reflectance spectrum. By combining the transmittance spectrum with a characteristic wavelength-screening algorithm, a Detrend-CARS-PLS-DA model was established. The accuracy rates in the testing sets of three hybrid wheat varieties (Jingmai 9, Jingmai 11, and Jingmai 183) were 95.69%, 98.25%, and 97.25%, respectively. Therefore, the chosen metric of transmittance hyperspectral imaging, when combined with a machine learning algorithm, can effectively distinguish female parent seeds from hybrid seeds."

        "Output": "Yes, based on the study's findings, transmittance hyperspectral imaging combined with a machine learning algorithm can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for distinguishing female parent seeds from hybrid seeds in hybrid wheat production. The study showed that using transmittance spectrum combined with a characteristic wavelength-screening algorithm, the Detrend-CARS-PLS-DA model achieved high accuracy rates in distinguishing between different types of seeds. This non-destructive and rapid method provides a reference for rapid seed purity detection in the hybrid production process and has the potential for future online sorting of hybrid wheat seeds."
