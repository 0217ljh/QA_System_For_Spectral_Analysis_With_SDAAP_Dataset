        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the predictions made using machine learning techniques in estimating GPP using remote sensing data by using linear regressions based on classic vegetation indices (VIs) and comparing the prediction powers and root mean square errors (RMSE) of different models. They compared the prediction powers and RMSE of models using classic VIs, such as near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), with models using red-edge-based and near-infrared-based VIs, such as Chlorophyll index red (CIR) and kernel NDVI (kNVDI). They also compared the prediction powers and RMSE of models using all spectral bands and VIs jointly in a machine learning prediction framework. Additionally, they noted that optical information alone is not enough to predict GPP properly under water-stress scenarios or heat waves."

The study found that using linear regressions based on classic VIs, such as near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), achieved a prediction power of R-10-fold(2) = 0.51 and an RMSE10-fold = 2.95 [mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)] in a 10-fold cross-validation."
