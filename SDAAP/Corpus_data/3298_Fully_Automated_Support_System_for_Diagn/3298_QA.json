        "instruction": "What metric was chosen to propose a fully automatic system as a diagnostic support tool for clinicians in the diagnosis of breast cancer, and how far can this metric go?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the system is sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positive results, i.e., the ability of the system to correctly identify malignant ROIs. Specificity measures the proportion of true negative results, i.e., the ability of the system to correctly identify benign ROIs. \n\nThe related study states that the median values of sensitivity and specificity achieved by the proposed system were 87.5% and 91.7%, respectively. This indicates that the system had a high accuracy in correctly identifying both malignant and benign ROIs."

        "instruction": "Can the proposed fully automatic system using Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) be considered superior to traditional diagnostic methods in the diagnosis of breast cancer?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed fully automatic system using Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) can be considered superior to traditional diagnostic methods in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The system demonstrated high performance in predicting benign/malignant regions of interest (ROIs) with median values of sensitivity and specificity of 87.5% and 91.7%, respectively. The performance of the system was higher compared to the state-of-the-art methods, even in the presence of a moderate/marked level of parenchymal background. Additionally, the system outperformed human readers by increasing the specificity by over 8%. This suggests that the system can serve as a valuable support tool for radiologists in interpreting CESM images, reducing the false positive rate and potentially limiting unnecessary biopsies and surgeries."
