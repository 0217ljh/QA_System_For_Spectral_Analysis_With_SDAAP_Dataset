        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to quantify the correlation between climatic factors and ET in the related study is the correlation coefficient (R). The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, in this case, temperature and ET. \n\nThe correlation coefficient (R) value of 0.80 indicates a strong positive correlation between temperature and ET. This means that as temperature increases, ET also increases."
