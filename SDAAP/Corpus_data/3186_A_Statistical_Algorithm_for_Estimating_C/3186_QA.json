        "Output": "A statistical algorithm was chosen to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration in optically complex waters of the New Caledonian lagoon. This metric can provide more accurate assessments of chlorophyll-a concentration and its variability in the lagoon, from shallow coastal waters and nearby reefs to deeper waters and the open ocean."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed algorithm, which combines a log-linear model for low chlorophyll-a concentration (AFLC) and a support vector machine (SVM) model or a classic model (OC3) for high chlorophyll-a concentration, outperforms the traditional OC3 approach in terms of accuracy and performance. The algorithm provides more accurate assessments of chlorophyll-a concentration and its variability in the optically complex waters of the New Caledonian lagoon, particularly in shallow waters. The root mean squared error of the proposed algorithm is 30% lower than that of the traditional OC3 approach. This indicates that the proposed algorithm is more effective in estimating chlorophyll-a concentration in this specific lagoon ecosystem."
