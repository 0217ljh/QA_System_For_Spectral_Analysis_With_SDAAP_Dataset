The curve resolved fluorescence investigation under 325 nm excitation provides discrimination factors between normal, cervicitis, and cervical cancer, such as collagen, bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and free NADH.\n\nThe results of the study show that the fluorescence emission intensity from collagen fiber is comparable in both normal and cervicitis, but significantly reduced in cervical cancer tissues. Additionally, fluorescence corresponding to bound NADH is reduced during the progression from normal to cervicitis and cervical cancer, while free NADH shows an opposite trend.\n\nTo analyze the spectral data and classify different categories, PCA was performed to obtain a reduced dimensional space. A supervised machine learning model based on SVM was then built using the PCA-re"
