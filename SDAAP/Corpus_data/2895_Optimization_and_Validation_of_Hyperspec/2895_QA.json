        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the inversion model for estimation of cotton nitrogen content in Xinjiang was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the nitrogen content that can be explained by the model, with a higher value indicating a better fit. The RMSE represents the average difference between the predicted and actual nitrogen content values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the findings of this study, the spectral modeling method using Support Vector Regression (SVR) was found to have a better inversion effect compared to the optimization of spectral indices in estimating leaf nitrogen content in cotton. The SVR model with characteristic spectral modeling achieved a higher accuracy and stability in estimating leaf nitrogen content, as indicated by a validated R-2 of 0.71 and an RMSE of 3.91. On the other hand, the optimization of spectral indices resulted in a reduction in accuracy but a significant improvement in stability. Therefore, while the SVR model with spectral modeling may provide higher accuracy, the optimization of spectral indices can be considered a more stable hyperspectral estimation method for the entire fertility period of cotton."
