        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the classification performance is the validation score. The validation score measures the accuracy of the classification model in correctly predicting the fluvial terrace levels.The validation scores of 0.73 and 0.76 for classifying two and three fluvial terrace classes, respectively, when using the entire unprocessed spectral dataset as input. The validation scores indicate the level of agreement between the predicted classes and the actual classes, with higher scores indicating better classification performance."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Feature importances were analyzed using the Scikit-learn random forest (RF) machine learning library. The RF algorithm was used to classify the fluvial terrace level classes based on the soil NIR spectra. The RF algorithm calculates the importance of each feature (spectral wavelength band) by measuring the decrease in the impurity of the target variable (fluvial terrace level) when that feature is used for splitting the data. \n\nBy examining the feature importances obtained from the RF algorithm, the researchers were able to identify the important spectral wavelength bands associated with specific soil components. The interpretation of the feature importances revealed that the absorption characteristics of smectite, kaolinite, carbonates, and talc were the most important factors in differentiating between fluvial terrace levels. The specific wavelength bands associated with smectite (5334 cm(-1) and 5269 cm(-1)) and kaolinite (3664 cm(-1) and 3699 cm(-1)) fractions were isolated and found to contribute significantly to the classification accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Soil NIR spectroscopy can be considered a superior and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for differentiating between fluvial terrace levels. Past study successfully demonstrated a strong correlation between the NIR spectra of soil samples and the height above river channel (HARC) of various fluvial terrace levels. The use of pre-processed spectra, principle component analysis (PCA), and partial least square regression (PLSR) resulted in a strong correlation. Additionally, it utilized the Scikit-learn random forest (RF) machine learning library to classify fluvial terrace level classes, achieving high validation scores. The interpretation of feature importances indicated that specific spectral wavelength bands associated with the absorption characteristics of certain minerals were most important in the classification. Therefore, soil NIR spectroscopy provides a rapid and cost-effective way to differentiate between fluvial terrace levels, offering a data-driven alternative to traditional in-situ stratigraphic and physiographic methods."
