        "input": "",
        "Output": "The spectral pretreatment by feature extraction improves the analysis accuracy and real-time capability of the analyzers in the related research on the analysis of hydrogen sulfide gas concentration in natural gas in the following ways:\n\n1. Improved regression predicating accuracy: The feature extraction technique enhances the accuracy of the regression model by 259 compared to using direct ELM. This means that the concentration of hydrogen sulfide can be predicted more accurately using the spectral data obtained through feature extraction. This improvement in accuracy ensures more reliable and precise analysis of the gas concentration.\n\n2. Reduced model operation time: The model operation time is reduced from 0.12 seconds to less than 10 milliseconds when using spectral pretreatment by feature extraction. This reduction in processing time allows for faster analysis of the gas concentration, enabling real-time monitoring and decision-making. The analyzers can provide quicker results, which is crucial in applications where immediate action is required.\n\n3. Reduced training time: The feature extraction technique also reduces the training time of the ELM model. By extracting relevant features from the spectral data, the model can be trained more efficiently. This reduction in training time allows for quicker deployment of the analyzers and faster adaptation to changes in the gas composition."
