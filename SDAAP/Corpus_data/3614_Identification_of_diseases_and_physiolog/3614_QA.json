        "input": "",
        "Output": "Based on the classifier accuracy, kappa, and ROC-AUC values obtained in the related  research, the use of multispectral cameras attached to UAVs can be considered superior to traditional methods for the detection of diseases and physiological disorders in commercial potato crops. The classifier accuracy values ranged from 73.5% to 82.5%, indicating a relatively high level of accuracy in distinguishing between diseased and healthy plants. The kappa values ranged from 0.56 to 0.71, indicating a moderate to substantial agreement between the predicted and observed classifications. The ROC-AUC values ranged from 0.97 to 0.98, indicating a high level of discrimination ability. These results suggest that the use of multispectral cameras attached to UAVs can provide a more accurate and reliable detection of diseases and physiological disorders compared to traditional methods."
