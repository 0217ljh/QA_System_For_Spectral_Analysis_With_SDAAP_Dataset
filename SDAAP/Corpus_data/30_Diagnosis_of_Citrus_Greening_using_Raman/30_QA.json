        "Output": "For the detection and classification of disease in citrus leaves, two machine learning models, namely partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and extreme learning machine (ELM), were utilized to achieve the purpose of verifying the applicability of Raman spectroscopy for disease detection and classification in citrus leaves.\n\nThe PLS-DA model was used to build a mathematical model based on the Raman spectra of citrus leaves. The spectra were collected using a Raman spectrometer and divided into five types: Huanglongbing (HLB), moderate HLB, serious HLB, nutrient deficiency, and normal. The PLS-DA model was trained using the Raman spectra data and the corresponding disease classification labels. It aimed to find the optimal mathematical relationship between the input variables (Raman spectra) and the output classes (disease types). \n\nThe ELM model was also employed in this study. However, the specific details of how the ELM model was utilized were not mentioned in the given related study. It can be inferred that the ELM model was likely used in a similar manner as the PLS-DA model to build a mathematical model for disease detection and classification based on the Raman spectra data.\n\nBoth models were used to optimize and improve the classification accuracy of the mathematical model."
