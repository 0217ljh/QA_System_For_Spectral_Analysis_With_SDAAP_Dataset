        "Output": "The semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SSGAN) improves the detection accuracy of headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HGC-IMS) in identifying the quality of rice and adulterated rice by utilizing additional category tags for generated samples to guide the training process. \n\nIn the SSGAN, the output layer of the discriminator in a traditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is replaced with a softmax classifier. This modification extends the GAN to a semi-supervised GAN, allowing for the inclusion of labeled data during training. \n\nBy incorporating labeled data, the SSGAN optimizes the network parameters through semi-supervised training. This process enhances the discriminant capabilities of the network, enabling it to accurately classify HGC-IMS images of volatile flavor substances in rice samples. \n\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the SSGAN achieves a prediction accuracy of 98.00%, which is significantly higher than other models such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), improved SVM models (LS-SVM and PCA-SVM), and deep learning models like VGGNet, ResNet, and Fast RCNN. \n\nFurthermore, the SSGAN also exhibits a high accuracy of 97.30% in classifying HGC"

In contrast, the HGC-IMS method simplifies the detection process by directly analyzing the volatile flavor substances of the rice samples, eliminating the need for extensive sample preparation.\n\nSecondly, the HGC-IMS method offers higher detection accuracies compared to traditional methods when it comes to identifying the quality of rice and detecting adulteration. The use of ion migration fingerprint spectra, identified through a semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SSGAN), allows for more precise and accurate classification of rice varieties and identification of adulterated rice.\n\nThe experimental results of the proposed method show a prediction accuracy of 98.00%, which is significantly higher than the rates achieved by other models, such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), improved SVM models (LS-SVM and PCA-SVM), and local geometric structure Fisher analysis (LGSFA).
