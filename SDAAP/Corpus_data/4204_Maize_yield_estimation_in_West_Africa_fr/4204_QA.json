        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the model performance of the remote sensing-based yield model was cross-validation. The model was evaluated against (a) simulated yields and (b) independent yields from ground surveys aggregated at the village level. The results showed that the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for year-on-year yield estimation at the end of the season when compared to simulated yields."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combined remote sensing, crop modeling, and machine learning method can be considered superior to traditional methods for estimating and forecasting inter-annual maize crop yields in Burkina Faso, considering the limited availability of field data. The study demonstrates that this method overcomes the current limitations of crop yield estimation by using remote sensing data, crop modeling, and statistical methods. The model performance was evaluated using cross-validation against simulated yields and independent yields from ground surveys, and the results showed that the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for year-on-year yield estimation. The RF model predicted 46% of the observed end-of-season maize grain yield variability two months before harvest. This approach is particularly effective in environments where field data are scarce, such as in most parts of the African continent, and can contribute to addressing challenges like declining food security."
