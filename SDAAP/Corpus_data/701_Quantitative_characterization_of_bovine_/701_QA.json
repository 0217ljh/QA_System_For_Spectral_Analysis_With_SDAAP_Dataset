This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable (concentration of BSA) that can be explained by the independent variables (THz frequencies). \n\nThe coefficient of determination R-2 ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect prediction and a value of 0 indicates no predictive power. In this case, the machine learning model achieved an R-2 value of 0.97932, which indicates a high level of prediction accuracy. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric, R-2, can go up to a maximum value of 1, indicating a perfect prediction."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The successful prediction of BSA concentrations using machine learning models and the identification of relevant frequencies in agreement with a long-wavelength elastic vibration model for BSA protein contribute to the application of spectroscopic methods in the quantitative characterization of BSA thin-films detected by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in several ways.\n\nFirstly, the use of machine learning methods allows for a more accurate and efficient analysis of the spectral data obtained from terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. By training a support vector regression model on the spectra data of BSA thin-films with known concentrations, the underlying relationship between the frequency and the target concentration can be learned. This enables the model to predict the concentrations of unknown test samples with a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.97932). This successful prediction demonstrates the potential of machine learning in providing quantitative characterization of BSA thin-films.\n\nSecondly, the identification of the three most discriminating frequencies in the terahertz frequency range (1.2, 1.1, and 0.5 THz) for BSA concentration further enhances the application of spectroscopic methods. These frequencies are determined using the maximal information coefficient statistical analysis, which helps to identify the relevance of each frequency to the concentration."
