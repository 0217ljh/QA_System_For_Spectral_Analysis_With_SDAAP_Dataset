        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the results of the handheld LIBS method is the relative standard deviation (RSD). The RSD is typically 15-20% for sum-normalized emission intensities above the estimated background. \n\nIn terms of accuracy and precision, the RSD provides a measure of the variability or dispersion of the data. A lower RSD indicates higher precision, meaning that the results are more consistent and reproducible. "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the handheld LIBS method presented in the related work, machine learning tools were utilized to convert qualitative LIBS spectral data into Feature-Of-Interest (FOI) maps. These FOI maps were used to distinguish various metasomatic and alteration features from the primary mantle mineralogy. By training the machine learning algorithms with known spectral signatures of different features, the algorithms were able to identify and classify these features in the LIBS data. This allowed for the mapping of specific minerals and alteration products, such as Cr-diopside, kelyphite rims on pyrope garnet, and calcite veinlets, within the samples."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The effectiveness of the handheld LIBS-based geochemical imaging method in mapping metasomatic and alteration features in rocks and minerals is comparable to traditional methods. The related work states that the qualitative LIBS spectral data can be converted to Feature-Of-Interest (FOI) maps, which can distinguish a variety of metasomatic and alteration features from the primary mineralogy. The resolution of the handheld LIBS-based geochemical imaging is also sufficient to map veinlets and grain boundaries lined with metasomatic minerals. Additionally, the LIBS approach is particularly sensitive in detecting elements with low atomic number, such as Li and Na, which are important geochemical tracers of hydrothermal and magmatic processes. Overall, the handheld LIBS-based geochemical imaging method provides a rapid and effective way to map metasomatic and alteration features in rocks and minerals in the field with minimal to no sample preparation."
