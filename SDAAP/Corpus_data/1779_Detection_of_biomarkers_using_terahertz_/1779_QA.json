        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the research on achieving classification and concentration detection of cancer biomarkers using a combination of terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, metasurface sensors, and machine learning, five machine learning algorithms were used. These algorithms were used to analyze both the time-domain and frequency-domain spectra of the biomarker THz spectrum.\n\nFor the time-domain spectrum, the random forest algorithm was employed. The time-domain spectra were collected for the biomarkers of five types and nine concentrations, with 100 sets of time-domain spectra per concentration. The random forest algorithm was able to classify the five biomarkers with an accuracy of 0.984.\n\nOn the other hand, for the frequency-domain spectrum, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used. The frequency-domain spectra were obtained by processing the time-domain spectra through noise reduction and fast Fourier transform. The SVM algorithm performed better in classifying the biomarkers in the frequency-domain spectrum, achieving an accuracy of 0.989.\n\nOverall, the machine learning algorithms were utilized to analyze the time-domain and frequency-domain spectra and determine the most suitable algorithm for classifying the biomarker THz spectrum. The experimental results demonstrated that the random forest algorithm was more effective for the time-domain spectrum, while the support vector machine algorithm was more suitable"
