        "Output": "Yes, the proposed chemometrics model based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm can be used to determine physical and/or chemical components in complex gas mixtures using infrared (IR) spectroscopic/sensing techniques. The model utilizes an ELM-based autoencoder (AE) to reduce the dimensionality of spectral signals and learn important features for regression. It also directly utilizes the fast regression ability of the ELM architecture to construct the regression model. The model has been tested and verified using both simulated data and experimental data acquired using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), specifically analyzing nitrogen oxide mixtures found in vehicle exhaust. The results of the analysis showed that the proposed model offers superior robustness and performance compared to conventional principle components regression (PCR) and partial least square regression (PLSR) models in quantitative IR spectral analysis."
