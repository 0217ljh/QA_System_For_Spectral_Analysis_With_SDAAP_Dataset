        "input": "",
        "Output": "The efficient spectrum pre-processing method coupled with the robust machine learning model improved the prediction performance of the sorting device in assessing the soluble solid content (SSC) of apples by achieving a high prediction accuracy. The developed support vector regression model, combined with a first-order derivative method for spectrum pre-processing, resulted in an R2 value of 0.8503 and an RMSEP value of 0.4781. This indicates that the model was able to accurately predict the SSC of apples. The use of machine learning techniques and effective pre-processing methods allowed for better utilization of the spectral data, leading to improved performance of the sorting device in predicting the SSC of apples."
