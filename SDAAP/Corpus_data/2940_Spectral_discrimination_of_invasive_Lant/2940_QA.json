        "Output": "Yes, the ratio-based and difference indices constructed with first and second-order derivative hyperspectral reflectance wavelengths can be used to discriminate Lantana Camara from co-occurring species during both the dry and wet seasons. The study found that these indices were able to perfectly separate Lantana Camara from co-occurring species with a separability accuracy of at least 97% in both seasons."
