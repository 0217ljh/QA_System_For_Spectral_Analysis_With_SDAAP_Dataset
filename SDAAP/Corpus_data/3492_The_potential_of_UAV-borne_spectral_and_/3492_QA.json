The rRMSE measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, relative to the range of the actual values. \n\nIn terms of assessing the models, the rRMSE can provide a measure of how well the models are able to predict the aboveground biomass and N(Fix) for the legume-grass mixtures. A lower rRMSE indicates a higher level of accuracy in the predictions. "

        "Output": "The machine learning algorithms, Partial Least Square (PLS) and Random Forest (RF) regression, were used to develop prediction models for estimating aboveground biomass and fixed nitrogen (N-Fix) in legume-grass mixtures using multispectral information from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These algorithms were chosen because multispectral data usually suffers from multicollinearity, and PLS and RF regression are effective in handling this issue.\n\nThe study compared prediction models with and without the inclusion of texture features derived from a grey level co-occurrence matrix. Texture features capture spatial relationships between pixels in the image, which is not accounted for by multispectral information and derived vegetation indices.\n\nThe prediction models were developed based on a multi-temporal field study that covered the entire vegetation period of the legume-grass mixtures. The models considered different proportions of legumes (ranging from 0% to 100%) to represent the variable conditions in practical farming.\n\nThe results showed that the inclusion of texture features substantially improved the accuracy of biomass prediction for the whole dataset as well as for crop-specific models. The best model for the whole dataset was generated using RF regression, with a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 10%. For N-Fix prediction accuracy"

        "Output": "The inclusion of texture features improved the accuracy of biomass prediction models and N-Fix prediction models in legume-grass mixtures using multispectral information from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The study found that the prediction accuracy for biomass was substantially improved when texture features were included, both for the entire dataset and for crop-specific models. The best model, generated using Random Forest (RF) regression, achieved an rRMSE (relative root mean square error) of 10% for biomass prediction. \n\nSimilarly, the inclusion of texture features also had a positive impact on N-Fix prediction accuracy. The best model, again using RF regression with texture features, achieved an rRMSEP (relative root mean square error of prediction) of 18% for N-Fix prediction. However, it is worth noting that the accuracy of N-Fix prediction models was not consistent across crop-specific models.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated that incorporating texture features from a grey level co-occurrence matrix improved the accuracy of biomass and N-Fix prediction models in legume-grass mixtures using multispectral information from UAVs."
