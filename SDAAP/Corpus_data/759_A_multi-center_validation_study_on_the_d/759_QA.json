        "Output": "The machine learning models were utilized in the development and validation of the method for automated serotyping of Legionella pneumophila by coupling them with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The FT-IR spectroscopy was used to collect spectral data from the Legionella isolates. These spectral data were then used as input features for the machine learning models.\n\nThe machine learning models were trained on a dataset consisting of 244 isolates, including Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, Legionella pneumophila serogroups 2-15, and Legionella non-pneumophila. The models were trained to classify the isolates into the different serogroups and discriminate between Legionella pneumophila and Legionella non-pneumophila.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of the method, careful data validation strategies were applied. The method was validated using a multi-centric approach with isolates from different sources, including Italian thermal and drinking water, as well as samples from German, Italian, French, and British collections. The method's performance was tested over a one-year time span with multiple operators and two different FT-IR instruments located in Italy and Germany.\n\nThe accuracy of the method was evaluated on different test sets. It achieved an overall accuracy of"
