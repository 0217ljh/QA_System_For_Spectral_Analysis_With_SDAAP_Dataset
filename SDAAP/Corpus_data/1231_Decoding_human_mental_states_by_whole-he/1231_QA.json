        "Output": "Yes, the use of neurovascular features in the EEG+fNIRS hybrid system can be considered superior to traditional decoding methods in quantifying mental states. The main results of the study mentioned in the text indicate that the decoding accuracy of the EEG+fNIRS hybrid system was greater than that of its individual subsystems. This improvement in accuracy can be attributed to the availability of new types of neurovascular features made possible by the combination of EEG and fNIRS data. Therefore, the EEG+fNIRS hybrid system offers a more accurate and practical decoding method for quantifying mental states compared to traditional methods."
