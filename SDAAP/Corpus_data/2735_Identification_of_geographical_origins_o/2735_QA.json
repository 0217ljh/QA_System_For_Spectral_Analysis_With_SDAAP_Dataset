        "Output": "In the related study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to acquire spectral images of Baishao samples from its two sides. This allowed for the collection of detailed spectral information from the samples. \n\nDeep learning strategies, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN) and attention mechanism, were then employed to analyze and distinguish the origins of Baishao based on the extracted spectra from one side of the samples. \n\nFurthermore, data-level and feature-level deep fusion models were proposed, which combined information from both sides of the samples. This integration of data from both sides enhanced the accuracy of the classification models.\n\nThe CNN models, utilizing deep learning techniques, outperformed conventional machine learning methods in accurately classifying the origins of Baishao.\n\nTo further understand the contribution of specific wavelengths to the model's performance, the generalized Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM++) technique was used. This visualization method helped identify important wavelengths that significantly influenced the model's accuracy.\n\nOverall, the combination of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning strategies proved to be effective in accurately identifying the geographical origins of Baishao."
