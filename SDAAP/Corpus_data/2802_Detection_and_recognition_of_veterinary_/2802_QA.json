        "Output": "Yes, the combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with deep learning algorithms can be considered a superior method for the fast and non-destructive recognition of veterinary drug residues in beef compared to traditional chemical detection techniques. The study showed that when DWT was combined with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, the overall accuracies achieved were 91.6%, 88.6%, 87.6%, and 86.2% respectively. Additionally, the Kappa coefficients and time consumption for prediction were also superior to models based on other data dimension reduction techniques such as Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the combination of DWT with deep learning algorithms provides a new and improved method for the fast and non-destructive detection and recognition of veterinary drug residues in beef."
