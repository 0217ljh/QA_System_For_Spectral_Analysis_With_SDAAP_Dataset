        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, four machine learning (ML) models were used to evaluate the reliability of a handheld Crop Circle ACS-430 sensor and estimate corn leaf nitrogen (N) concentration and predict grain yield. The analysis was conducted at three different growth stages of corn.\n\nFirst, the Crop Circle multispectral data collected by the ACS-430 sensor was used to calculate vegetation indices (VIs) at different growth stages of corn. This multispectral raw data, along with visible (Vis) data, was then used to quantify the leaf N status and predict the yield of corn.\n\nTo identify the best prediction model, four ML models were utilized. These models were trained and tested using a stratification approach, where the limited observed data was split into balanced sets for each growth stage. Repeated cross-validation (RCV) was employed to train the models.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the Simplified Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (SCCCI) and Red-edge ratio vegetation index (RERVI) were the most effective VIs for estimating leaf N concentration."
