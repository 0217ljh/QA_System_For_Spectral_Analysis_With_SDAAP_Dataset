        "Output": "The researchers applied machine learning algorithms to the FTIR spectroscopy data by training the algorithms using a dataset consisting of 591 ESBL-producing and 1658 non-ESBL-producing samples of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They used this dataset to teach the algorithms to recognize the molecular changes in the FTIR spectra that are indicative of ESBL-producing bacteria. Once the algorithms were trained, they were able to analyze new FTIR spectroscopy data from patient urine samples and classify them as either ESBL-producing or non-ESBL-producing bacteria. This allowed for the rapid identification of ESBL-producing bacteria within 40 minutes of receiving the urine sample, with a success rate of 80%."
