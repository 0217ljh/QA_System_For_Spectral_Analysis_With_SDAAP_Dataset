        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction models in this study is the regression value (R). The regression value measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted and actual values of the pasting parameters. \n\nThe regression values reported in the study range from 0.57 to 0.99, depending on the specific pasting parameter and the machine learning algorithm used. A regression value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the predicted and actual values, while a value of 0 indicates no relationship. \n\nBased on the reported regression values, the prediction models developed using iPLS and siPLS algorithms generally have good to excellent performance in predicting the pasting parameters of rice. The ANN algorithm further improves the models, achieving near-perfect regression values for the calibration procedure (R-cal) and relatively high values for the testing procedure (R-test). \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of regression value demonstrates the effectiveness of the prediction models in evaluating rice quality based on the pasting parameters. However, it is important to note that the metric alone does not provide information on the accuracy or precision of the predictions. Further validation and testing would be necessary to assess the true performance and reliability of these models."
