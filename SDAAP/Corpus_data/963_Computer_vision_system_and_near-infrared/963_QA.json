        "Output": "Yes, the combination of Computer Vision System (CVS) and spectral information from the Near Infrared (NIR) region can be considered a superior method for identifying and classifying chicken with Wooden Breast (WB) anomaly compared to traditional methods. In the study mentioned, the combination of image analyses with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model achieved a classification accuracy of 91.8% for identifying WB or Normal (N) chicken breasts. Additionally, NIR spectral information showed a high accuracy of 97.5%. These results suggest that the CVS and NIR spectroscopy methods are rapid and non-destructive, making them efficient and effective tools for identifying and classifying WB in poultry slaughterhouses."
