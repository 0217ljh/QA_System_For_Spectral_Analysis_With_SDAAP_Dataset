        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, the machine learning method using the optimized discriminant classifier based on VNIR reflectance spectra showed great potential for early detection of drought stress on lettuce leaves before any visible symptoms and size differences were evident. The classification accuracies achieved were over 90% for the first four days of the stress treatment. This suggests that the machine learning method using the optimized discriminant classifier based on VNIR reflectance spectra may be considered superior to traditional methods for early detection of plant stresses in controlled-environment space crop production."
