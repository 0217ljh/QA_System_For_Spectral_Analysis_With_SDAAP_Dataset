        "Output": "Yes, the 1D-CNN model based on NIRS can be considered a superior method compared to traditional shallow learning classifiers or classifiers combined with wavelength selection algorithms for distinguishing aristolochic acids (AAs) and their analogues in Chinese herbs. The experimental comparison results show that the generalized performance of the 1D-CNN model outperforms the traditional classifiers. Additionally, the t-SNE visualization results indicate that the 1D-CNN model has excellent feature learning ability. Therefore, the designed 1D-CNN model using the NIRS technique is an easy and effective qualitative analysis tool for the detection of AAs and their analogues."
