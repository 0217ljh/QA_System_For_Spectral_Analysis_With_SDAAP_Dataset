        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly stated whether hyperspectral imaging and deep learning methods can be used to classify other types of human tissue besides fat, muscle, and mucosa. The study mentioned in the text specifically focused on classifying these three types of oral tissue. However, the text does mention that the hyperspectral signatures collected in this study can serve as a representative reference for future assessment of oral pathological changes. This suggests that the approach could potentially be applied to other types of tissue, but further research would be needed to determine its effectiveness in classifying other tissue types."
