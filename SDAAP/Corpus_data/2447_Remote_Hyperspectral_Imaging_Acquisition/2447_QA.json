These methods were used for marine litter artificial target detection based on previous training. The system utilized the spatial and spectral response data obtained from the in-situ characterization of marine litter samples in the laboratory environment, as well as the remote observation data acquired during the dataset flights. The RF and SVM algorithms were trained using these datasets to detect marine litter concentrations in an oceanic environment. The obtained results showed a marine litter automated detection capability with a precision rate of 70-80% in all three targets, compared to ground-truth pixels, as well as recall rates over 50%."
