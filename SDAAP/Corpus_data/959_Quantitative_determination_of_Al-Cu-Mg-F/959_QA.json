        "Output": "Yes, based on the results of the related study, the combination of LIBS and machine learning techniques can be considered superior to traditional univariate linear calibration and PLSR models for accurately determining the content of minor elements in aluminum alloys. The study employed LIBS technology combined with LASSO for spectral feature selection and LSSVM for regression to establish a multivariate quantitative analysis model. The results demonstrated that this multivariate calibration model had higher accuracy compared to the traditional univariate linear calibration and PLSR models. Therefore, the combination of LIBS and machine learning techniques shows potential for improving the determination of minor elements in aluminum alloys."
