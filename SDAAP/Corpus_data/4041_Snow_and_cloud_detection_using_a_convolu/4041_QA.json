It utilizes textures in multispectral satellite images received from a scanning instrument installed on the Russian satellite Electro-L No. 2. The algorithm is designed to address the problem of snow and cloud classification in the absence of a specific spectral channel required for accurate separation. It can produce cloud and snow cover masks for a specific area during daytime, and its accuracy has been evaluated using machine learning metrics and comparison with ground truth masks."
