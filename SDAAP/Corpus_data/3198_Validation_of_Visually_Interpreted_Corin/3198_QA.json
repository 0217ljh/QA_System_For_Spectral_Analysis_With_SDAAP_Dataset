        "Output": "The machine learning models, specifically Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest (RF) classifications, were used to analyze the correspondence between land cover categories of the CLC2018 dataset and the spectral information of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope images. \n\nFirst, the spectral data from the satellite images were summarized by land cover polygons. Then, the dataset was evaluated using statistical tests. \n\nNext, the LDA and RF classifications were performed to determine if the land cover categories of the CLC2018 dataset could be confirmed by the spectral values. These models were used to classify and predict the land cover categories based on the spectral information. \n\nThe results showed that RF outperformed LDA in terms of accuracy, and PlanetScope's data were found to be the most accurate. \n\nOverall, the machine learning models were utilized to assess the correspondence between the CLC2018 land cover categories and the spectral information from the satellite images, providing insights into the accuracy and reliability of using CLC polygons as ground truth data for land cover classifications."
