        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectrum method can be used in the related research to accurately estimate the Canopy Chlorophyll Density (CCD) of maize at different growth stages. The study mentions that multiple features derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images were used to develop CCD estimation models. These features include vegetation indices and band reflectance, which are spectral features. The Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR) models trained over these spectral features yielded the best performance for the estimation of CCD, with high R-2 values and low RMSE values. Therefore, the spectrum method, using spectral features derived from multispectral images, can accurately estimate CCD at different growth stages of maize."
