        "input": "",
        "Output": "The modified U-TAE approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of land cover classification performance. It achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 57.25%, which is higher than the mIoU scores of three other popular approaches: random forest (39.69%), U-Net (55.73%), and SegFormer (53.5%). Additionally, the modified U-TAE approach uses fewer training parameters, indicating a reduction in complexity. The approach utilizes satellite image composites with reduced noise, created using temporal median instead of the original noisy images affected by clouds and calibration errors. Furthermore, it incorporates channel attention instead of temporal attention, which was used in the original approach. The evaluation also highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate combination of input bands for improved performance."
