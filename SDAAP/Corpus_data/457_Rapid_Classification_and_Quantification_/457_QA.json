        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the model performance in the past study was cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent data set. It involves splitting the available data into training and validation sets, and then repeatedly fitting and evaluating the model on different subsets of the data.\n\nThe predictions for coal quality analysis using the different models were reported in terms of their root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction. The RMSE is a measure of the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values. \n\nFor the proximate analysis indicators of coal quality (ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon), the RMSE of prediction using the partial least squares regression model were reported as 1.012%, 0.878%, and 1.409%, respectively. This indicates that the predictions for these indicators had relatively low errors, suggesting that the regression model was able to provide accurate quantitative predictions for coal quality analysis.\n\nIt is important to note that the accuracy of the predictions may vary depending on the specific coal samples and the application scenario."

        "Output": "Machine learning models were used to analyze the coal quality using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The coal samples were divided into training, test, and prediction sets. Different machine learning models were established for performance analysis in various application scenarios.\n\nClustering models were used to cluster coal samples based on their spectra. The K-means clustering algorithm was employed to effectively divide the coal samples into four clusters. These clusters were similar within the class but different between classes, providing insights into the similarities and differences in coal quality.\n\nClassification models were used to classify coal samples into different categories based on their labels. The naive Bayesian classification model was utilized to distinguish coal samples based on their origins. The model used the probability distribution function to assign coal samples to different origins. The prediction accuracy of this model was found to be 0.967, indicating its effectiveness in classifying coal samples.\n\nRegression models were used to provide quantitative prediction results for proximate analysis indicators of coal quality. The partial least squares regression model was employed to reduce the influence of multivariate collinearity on prediction. This model was able to predict the ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon content of coal samples with root mean square errors of prediction of 1.012%, 0.878%, and "
