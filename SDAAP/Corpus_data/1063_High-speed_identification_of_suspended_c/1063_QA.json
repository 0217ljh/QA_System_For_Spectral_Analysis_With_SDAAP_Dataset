Therefore, it can be inferred that the metric used to measure classification accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified samples. The text does not provide information on how far this metric can go beyond the mentioned values of 90% and 98%."

        "Output": "The optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) was used in the high-throughput approach to identify suspended carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by applying a threshold on the output of the softmax layer. The CNN was trained using deep learning analysis on Raman spectra with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The classification accuracy of the CNN exceeded 90% for Raman spectra with an SNR of 0.9 and reached 98% for an SNR of 2.2. By applying the threshold on the softmax layer output, the accuracy of the classification was further increased. This optimized CNN allowed for the rapid and accurate identification of CNTs in the high-speed Raman imaging process."

The text states that the approach can readily be extended to other types of nanomaterials, indicating its versatility. This suggests that the same methodology can be used to rapidly localize and characterize different nanomaterials at various stages of integration into large-scale fabrication processes, allowing for efficient quality control and monitoring."
