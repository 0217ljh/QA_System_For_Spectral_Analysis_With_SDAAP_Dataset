        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in analyzing cerebral cortex activity can be considered superior to traditional methods in identifying a driver's brake intention. The study mentioned in the text used fNIRS experiments to establish a model for identifying the driver's brake intention with a high accuracy rate of 90.91%. Additionally, the study found significant differences in brain activity between drivers with braking intention and those driving at a constant speed, suggesting that fNIRS can provide valuable insights into the cognitive processes involved in driving intention identification."
