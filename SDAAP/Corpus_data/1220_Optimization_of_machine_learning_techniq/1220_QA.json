        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of vibrational spectroscopies in the analysis of FTIR spectra of biological human serum samples can support and validate the quantification of clinical parameters and the identification of pathologies or states of alteration. The text states that machine learning regression methods were compared for the analysis of FTIR spectra of biological human serum samples to predict 6 clinical parameters. The prediction ability was found to be excellent for several parameters, such as Triglycerides, Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, and Urea. This suggests that vibrational spectroscopies can be a reliable method for quantifying these clinical parameters. Additionally, the text mentions that the results obtained here go in the direction of standardizing the FTIR data analysis methodology to optimize the prediction of clinical parameters. This further supports the use of vibrational spectroscopies in the analysis of FTIR spectra for clinical parameter quantification and pathology identification."
