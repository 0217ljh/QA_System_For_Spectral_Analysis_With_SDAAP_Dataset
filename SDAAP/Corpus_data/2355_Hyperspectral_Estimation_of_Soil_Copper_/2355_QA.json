        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in the related research on monitoring soil heavy metal pollution using soil hyperspectral data and regression models is the coefficient of determination (R-2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (soil heavy metal contamination) that can be explained by the independent variables (soil hyperspectral data). \n\nThe R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit of the model to the data. In the related research, the improved TabNet model achieved an R-2 value of 0.94, indicating that 94% of the variance in soil heavy metal contamination can be explained by the model. \n\nThe R-2 metric provides a measure of how well the model fits the data and can be used to compare the performance of different models."

        "Output": "In the related research, the preprocessing methods used to improve the performance of the models in monitoring soil heavy metal pollution using soil hyperspectral data and regression models were as follows:\n\n1. Second-order differential derivation: This method was combined with other preprocessing techniques to enhance the spectral characteristics of the soil hyperspectral data. It helped to extract more effective features from the data and reduce interference information.\n\n2. Data enhancement (DA) method: The DA method was applied along with the second-order differential derivation to further enhance the data. It helped to improve the quality of the soil hyperspectral data and increase the effectiveness of the features extracted.\n\n3. Addition of auxiliary information: In addition to the soil hyperspectral data, other soil-related auxiliary information was also incorporated into the preprocessing method. This auxiliary information provided additional context and helped to improve the accuracy of the models in predicting soil heavy metal contamination.\n\nThese preprocessing methods were applied in combination to create an improved version of the attentive interpretable tabular learning (TabNet) model. The improved TabNet model, along with three other variations of the TabNet model, was used to create regression models for predicting soil heavy metal contamination."

        "Output": "Yes, the new preprocessing method, combined with the improved TabNet model and improved CNN model, can be considered superior to traditional preprocessing methods in effectively monitoring soil heavy metal pollution using soil hyperspectral data. The results of the experiment showed that both the improved TabNet model and the improved CNN model had better performance using the new preprocessing approach. The improved TabNet model yielded a coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) of 0.94, 1341, and 4.474, respectively. The improved CNN model had a coefficient of determination of 0.942, an RMSE of 1324, and an interquartile range of 4.531 in the test dataset. These results indicate that the new preprocessing method, combined with the improved TabNet model and improved CNN model, outperformed traditional preprocessing methods in effectively monitoring soil heavy metal pollution."
