        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the diagnostic system for hepatitis C infection using Raman spectroscopy and proximity-based classification, machine learning techniques were utilized to analyze and classify the Raman spectral data. Specifically, the proposed method, RS-PCA-Prox, employed a proximity-based machine learning technique to exploit transformed Raman spectra. \n\nFirst, the Raman spectral data was baseline corrected by subtracting noise and low intensity background. Then, a feature transformation of the Raman spectra was adopted to reduce the dimensionality of the features and learn different deviations in Raman shifts. This feature transformation was performed using the proximity-based machine learning technique.\n\nThe RS-PCA-Prox method demonstrated significant diagnostic power in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, achieving 95% accuracy, 0.97 sensitivity, and 0.94 specificity in the PCA-based transformed domain. The comparison of RS-PCA-Prox with linear and ensemble-based classifiers showed that proximity-based classification performed better for discriminating HCV infected individuals and differentiating them from normal individuals based on molecular spectral information.\n\nTherefore, machine learning techniques, specifically proximity-based classification, were utilized to analyze and classify the Raman spectral data in the diagnostic system for hepatitis C infection."
