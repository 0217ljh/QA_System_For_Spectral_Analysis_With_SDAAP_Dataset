        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models of flour milling yield (MY)% is the adjusted-R-2 cross-validation value. This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (MY%) that can be explained by the independent variables (extracted features). \n\nThe adjusted-R-2 cross-validation value can provide insights into the accuracy and performance of the models. In this research, the adjusted-R-2 cross-validation values were reported as 0.61 for MY%. This indicates that the models using the extracted features were able to explain 61% of the variance in flour milling yield.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the adjusted-R-2 cross-validation value alone does not provide a complete picture of the model's performance. Other metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) were also reported in the study. RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values of MY%. In this case, the cross-validation RMSE for the MY% model was reported as 1.24%.\n\nWhile the adjusted-R-2 cross-validation value and RMSE provide valuable information about the model's performance, they do not capture all aspects of the research.

The combination of all features as input variables for a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model yielded the best accuracy, with adjusted-R-2 cross-validation values of 0.61 for MY%. The corresponding cross-validation root mean square error (RMSE) of the MY% model was 1.24%. This indicates that the models were able to accurately predict the flour milling yield based on the image and spectral data, outperforming traditional methods."
