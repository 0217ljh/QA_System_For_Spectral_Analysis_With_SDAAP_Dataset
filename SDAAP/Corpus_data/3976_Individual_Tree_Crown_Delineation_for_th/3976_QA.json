        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the performance of the ITCD algorithm is the crown contouring accuracy. The related study states that for typical scenes, the crown contouring accuracy is about 95%. This metric measures how accurately the algorithm is able to delineate the individual tree crowns in the forest stands."
