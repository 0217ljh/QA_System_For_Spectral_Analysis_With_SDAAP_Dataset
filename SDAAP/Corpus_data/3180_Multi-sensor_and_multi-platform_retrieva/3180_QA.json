        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to reveal the spectral response characteristics of karst wetland water bodies was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the Chla values that can be explained by the spectral data. In the related study, the R-2 values ranged from 0.670 to 0.814, indicating that the retrieval methods were able to explain between 67% and 81.4% of the variance in the Chla values."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of transfer learning methods from ASD to UAV platform can be considered superior to methods from UAV to Planet platform in estimating water Chla in karst wetland using multi-platform and multi-sensor data. The related study found that the transfer learning methods from ASD to UAV platform provided a higher retrieval performance with an average R-2 of 0.669, compared to methods from UAV to Planet platform. Additionally, the transfer learning methods obtained the highest estimation accuracy of Chla with an R-2 of 0.814 when the ratio of the training and test data in the target domain was 7:3. This indicates that transfer learning is more suitable for estimating Chla in karst wetland water bodies using multi-platform and multi-sensor data."
