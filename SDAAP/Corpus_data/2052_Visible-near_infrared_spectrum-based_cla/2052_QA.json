        "Output": "The use of cloud computing technology significantly improves the feasibility of spectrum-based classification of apple chilling injury compared to traditional methods. The paper states that by using a cloud computing framework based on Spark and the MLlib machine learning library, the researchers were able to establish an efficient spectrum classification model. This suggests that cloud computing allows for faster and more efficient processing of the large amounts of spectral data required for classification.\n\nAdditionally, the paper mentions that the cloud computing platform showed improved efficiency when handling larger data sets or increasing the number of working nodes. This indicates that cloud computing can easily scale to accommodate the processing needs of spectrum-based classification, which may not be possible with traditional methods on a desktop PC due to processor and memory limitations.\n\nFurthermore, the paper highlights that the classification accuracy using full-waveband spectral data sets was higher than that of data sets using only five optimal wavebands. This suggests that cloud computing enables the use of more comprehensive data sets, leading to more accurate classification results.\n\nOverall, the use of cloud computing technology enhances the feasibility of spectrum-based classification of apple chilling injury by enabling faster processing, scalability, and the utilization of larger and more comprehensive data sets."
