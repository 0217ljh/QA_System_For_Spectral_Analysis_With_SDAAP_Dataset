        "Output": "The synthesized classification method using multisensor hyperspectral imaging improves the accuracy of identifying seed vitality compared to traditional methods by utilizing advanced information technologies and preprocessing techniques. \n\nFirstly, hyperspectral images in a wide range of wavelengths (370-1042 nm) are collected for waxy corn seeds that have undergone aging processing. This allows for a comprehensive analysis of the seeds' spectral characteristics, capturing detailed information about their vitality.\n\nTo enhance the accuracy of the analysis, several preprocessing techniques are employed to suppress noise interference in the raw spectra. These techniques include standard normal variate, multiplicative scatter correction, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, and first-order and second-order derivatives. By reducing noise, the quality of the spectral data is improved, leading to more accurate identification of seed vitality.\n\nFurthermore, feature wavelength selection is performed using principal component analysis (PCA), 2nd derivatization, and successive projection algorithm (SPA). This step helps to identify the most relevant wavelengths that are strongly correlated with seed vitality. By focusing on these specific wavelengths, the classification model can achieve higher accuracy in distinguishing between different levels of seed vitality.\n\nThe classification models are then established using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms based on both the full spectra and the selected feature wavelengths. The results show that the"
