        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectroscopic method can be used to determine the spatial distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) in cultivated lands, as stated in the purpose of the related study. The study mentions that machine learning models based on spectral data and environmental variables were established to predict the overall spatial distribution of SOM. The Random Forest (RF) model, which is based on spectral data, had the best prediction effect with high accuracy. Therefore, the spectroscopic method is effective in determining the spatial distribution of SOM in cultivated lands."
