        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, three machine learning classifiers were utilized to optimize the multi-variable integration for suburban LULC classification. The classifiers used were random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). These classifiers were adopted in various scenarios to analyze the effects of multi-variable fusion.\n\nThe study employed the mean decrease impurity method to identify the importance of variables. By using different combinations of aerial imageries and LiDAR-derived data, the researchers assessed the performance of the classifiers under different scenarios. The fusion of aerial imagery and all the LiDAR-derived models, including the normalized digital surface model (nDSM), surface roughness model (RM), and surface intensity model (IM), with the random forest classifier yielded the best results in suburban LULC classification.\n\nThe overall accuracy achieved with this fusion approach was 84.75%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.80. The variable importance analysis revealed that the nDSM had the highest variable importance proportion (VIP) value, followed by RM, IM, and spectral information. This analysis indicated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed LiDAR-derived model, RM, for enhancing the suburban LULC classification."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fusion of aerial imagery and LiDAR-derived models using the random forest classifier outperforms traditional methods in enhancing land use/land cover (LULC) classification in suburban areas. The overall accuracy achieved with this approach is 84.75%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.80. This indicates a high level of accuracy in classifying different land cover types in suburban areas. The variable importance analysis also shows that the normalized digital surface model (nDSM) derived from LiDAR data has the highest importance proportion, followed by the surface roughness model (RM), surface intensity model (IM), and spectral information from aerial imagery. This suggests that the fusion of LiDAR-derived models with aerial imagery provides valuable information for accurately classifying LULC in suburban areas."
