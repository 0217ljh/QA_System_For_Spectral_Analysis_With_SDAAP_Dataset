The study found that the daytime random forest (RF)-based algorithm outperformed the operational algorithm by improving the accuracy of cloudy pixel detection by approximately 5% and reducing misjudgment by approximately 3%. Additionally, the nighttime model with only infrared observations was also slightly better than the operational product. Overall, the ML-based algorithms proved to be reliable in providing cloud mask results for both daytime and nighttime observations."
