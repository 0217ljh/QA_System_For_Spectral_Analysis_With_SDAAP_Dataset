The portable system overcomes the shortcomings of traditional spectroscopy systems, such as large volume, high cost, complicated operation, and difficulty in online detection. The combination of machine learning algorithms (such as partial least squares and extreme learning machine) and chemometric methods (such as synergy interval and genetic algorithm) in the system improves the accuracy and feasibility of blood glucose measurement. The experimental results showed that the model based on the combination of Si and GA and ELM (Si-GA-ELM model) was the most accurate among the selected models. Additionally, the use of the TrAdaBoost model transfer method further enhances the accuracy and stability of the system. Overall, the developed portable NIRS system with machine learning and chemometric methods represents an innovative and superior approach to noninvasive blood glucose concentration detection compared to traditional spectroscopy systems."
