They measured the accuracy rates of each method to determine their effectiveness in correctly classifying Ginseng samples with different growth ages. The experimental results showed that SVM based on SPCS (SPCS-SVM) had a higher accuracy rate of more than 99.6% compared to GA-SVM and CS-SVM. This indicates that the SPCS-SVM method outperformed the other two methods in accurately classifying Ginseng samples based on their growth ages using terahertz spectrum and the SVM model."

The accuracy rate of the SPCS-SVM algorithm is more than 99.6%, indicating its high precision in classifying Ginseng with different growth ages. This outperforms traditional methods such as SVM based on genetic algorithm (GA-SVM) and SVM based on CS (CS-SVM). The experimental results demonstrate that the terahertz spectroscopy coupled with the SPCS-SVM algorithm is an effective approach for the classification of Ginseng with different growth ages."
