The study showed that this combination achieved the best results compared to other models, with an (RP)-P-2 value of 0.843, RMSEP of 2.461 g.kg(-1), and RPD of 2.508. Therefore, it can be concluded that this combination is feasible and reliable for estimating the leaf N content in apple trees on the Loess Plateau."
