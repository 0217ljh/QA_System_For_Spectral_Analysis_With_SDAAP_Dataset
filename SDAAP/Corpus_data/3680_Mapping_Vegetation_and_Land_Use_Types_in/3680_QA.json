        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of multi-temporal Spectral Vegetation Index (SVI) composites with simple illumination normalization and elevation ancillary data can be considered as a superior spectral feature processing method compared to traditional methods for mapping forest cover and land use in the challenging terrain and persistent cloud cover of the Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China. The related study states that this approach effectively minimizes the persistent cloud cover and terrain issues, resulting in significantly higher mapping accuracies compared to non-normalized spectral bands. The accuracy assessment results indicate consistent and effective overall classification can be achieved using this methodology, even with limited training and reference data. Therefore, this efficient and open-access image analysis workflow provides a reliable methodology to remotely monitor forest cover and land use in FNNR and other similar mountainous forested, cloud prevalent areas."
