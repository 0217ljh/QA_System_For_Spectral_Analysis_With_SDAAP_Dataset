        "Output": "Yes, the proposed method of hierarchical representation of water saturation of rock using near-infrared spectroscopy can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of real-time and nondestructive identification of water saturation levels. The method establishes a classification and recognition theory based on near-infrared spectrum acquisition experiments of rock under different water saturation levels. By using the partial least square (PLS) method, a recognition model is established, which allows for real-time identification of the saturation level in the gravel water absorption process. This method provides better recognition precision and can accurately determine the water saturation level of the rock without causing any damage to the sample. Additionally, the use of appropriate threshold parameters and multiple spectral segments in the modeling greatly improves the recognition accuracy of the model."
