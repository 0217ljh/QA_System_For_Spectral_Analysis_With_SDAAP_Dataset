        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the AGB estimation accuracy for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in rubber plantations was the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the AGB that can be explained by the model, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect fit. The RMSE represents the average difference between the predicted AGB values and the actual AGB values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy.\n\nThe study reported an R2 value of 0.752 and an RMSE value of 28.72 t/ha for the best-performing model, which used support vector regression with the combination of spectral information and texture features. This means that the model can explain approximately 75.2% of the variance in AGB and has an average difference of 28.72 t/ha between predicted and actual AGB values."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The results of comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms for AGB estimation in rubber plantations using UAV-based high-resolution RGB imagery and different textural parameter settings showed that support vector regression performed the best among the four regression techniques. The best estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.752, RMSE = 28.72 t/ha) was obtained by support vector regression when using the combination of spectral information and texture features with the textural parameters of the orientation of 135, displacement of 2 pixels, and moving window size parameter of 7 x 7 pixels. This suggests that the AGB estimation accuracy can be further improved by integrating spectral information and texture features with appropriate textural parameters."

        "Output": "Yes, the integration of spectral information and texture features with appropriate textural parameters can improve the accuracy of aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in rubber plantations using UAV-based high-resolution RGB imagery. The study evaluated the performance of spectral information and texture features derived from UAV-based imagery with different textural parameter settings. The results indicated that appropriate textural parameter selection significantly improved the AGB estimation accuracy when using texture features alone. The best estimation accuracy was obtained by using the combination of spectral information and texture features with specific textural parameters. Therefore, integrating spectral information and texture features with suitable textural parameters can enhance the accuracy of AGB estimation in rubber plantations using UAV-based high-resolution RGB imagery."
