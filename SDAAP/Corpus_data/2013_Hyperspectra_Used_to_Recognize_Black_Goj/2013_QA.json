        "Output": "In the study, two machine learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), were utilized to identify Black Goji Berry and nitraria tanggu using hyperspectral image technology.\n\nThe hyperspectral reflection spectra of Black Goji Berry and nitraria tanggu were collected in the range of 900-1,700 nm, resulting in a total of 254 bands. The first 22 abnormal bands were removed, and the remaining 232 bands were used as model inputs.\n\nTo divide the samples, the Kennard-Stone method was employed, with a correction set prediction set ratio of 2:1. \n\nNext, the Spectral Dimensionality Reduction technique called Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data. The characteristic wavelength range was set from 0 to 30, and 20 characteristic wavelengths were extracted using SPA.\n\nBoth the full spectrum and the 20 characteristic wavelengths extracted by SPA were used as inputs to establish SVM and ELM models. These models were trained to recognize and differentiate between Black Goji Berry and nitraria tanggu."

These methods have been proven to be effective in accurately identifying Black Goji Berry and nitraria Tanggu, and can potentially be used to identify other plant species as well. By collecting hyperspectral reflection spectra and using spectral dimensionality reduction techniques like SPA, researchers can extract characteristic wavelengths and establish machine learning models like SVM and ELM for identification purposes. This approach can be applied to various plant species, enabling non-destructive identification in different research areas."
