        "Output": "In the related study, several classification models were built using different methods. Logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) were used as traditional machine learning algorithms. Convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were used as deep learning methods. These models were trained and tested using the spectral data extracted from near-infrared hyperspectral imaging. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract features from the data. The extracted features were then used as inputs for the CNN, RNN, and LSTM models. The models were evaluated based on their classification accuracy in the calibration, validation, and prediction sets. The results showed that the models using full spectra, extracted features, and fused features achieved classification accuracy over 90% in most cases, indicating the effectiveness of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging with deep learning methods for identifying coated maize varieties."
