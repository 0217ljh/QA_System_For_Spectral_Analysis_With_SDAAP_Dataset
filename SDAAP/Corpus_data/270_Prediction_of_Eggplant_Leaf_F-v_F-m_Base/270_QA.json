        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the F-v/F-m prediction model was the determination coefficient (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the F-v/F-m parameter that can be explained by the model. In this research, the highest R-2 value achieved by the best-performing model was 0.9117. \n\nThe R-2 value can range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance in the parameter, and 1 indicates that the model perfectly predicts the parameter. Therefore, the R-2 value of 0.9117 indicates that the model can explain approximately 91.17% of the variance in the F-v/F-m parameter. \n\nIt is important to note that the R-2 value alone does not provide information about the absolute accuracy of the predictions. To assess the absolute accuracy, the root mean square error (RMSE) was also calculated. The RMSE values obtained in this research were 0.0108 for the best-performing model. The RMSE represents the average magnitude of the prediction errors, with lower values indicating higher accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of multivariate scattering correction (MSC) and standard normal variable transformation (SNV) with the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling method and successive projections algorithm (CARS-SPA) outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and complexity for predicting F-v/F-m based on the visible-near infrared spectrum.\n\nThe research conducted on eggplant leaves showed that the MSC-CARS-SPA-PLSR and SNV-CARS-SPA-PLSR models achieved higher accuracy compared to the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model using the full spectrum data. The determination coefficients (R-2) for the test set were 0.8961 and 0.8812, respectively, for MSC-CARS-SPA-PLSR and SNV-CARS-SPA-PLSR. The root mean square errors were 0.0118 and 0.0126, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, both the MSC-CARS-SPA-PLSR and SNV-CARS-SPA-PLSR methods selected only 12 characteristic wavelengths, which accounted for only 0.88% of the full spectrum (1358). This indicates that a small number of wavelengths were sufficient for accurate modeling, reducing the complexity of the model."
