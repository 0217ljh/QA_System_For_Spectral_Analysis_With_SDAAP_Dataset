The machine learning models used in the study were support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), extremely randomized trees regression (ETR), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), and stacking learning (STL).\n\nTo enhance the performance of the PROSAIL model, the adjusted average leaf angle (ALA(adj)) values for wheat, soybean, and maize crops were generated based on ground-measured spectra, LAI, and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). These ALA(adj) values were then used as input data for the machine learning models.\n\nThe machine learning models were trained using simulated data of the ALA(adj) in 50-band data. By utilizing the ALA(adj) datasets, the machine learning algorithms were able to estimate the CCC and LAI of the crops with improved accuracy. The estimation results for singular crop parameters, particularly the crop LAI, showed significant enhancement when using the ALA(adj) data.\n\nFurthermore, when estimating mixed crops, the machine learning algorithms using the ALA(adj) datasets outperformed the estimations without using the AL"

The machine learning algorithms, including support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), extremely randomized trees regression (ETR), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), and stacking learning (STL), were applied to simulated data of ALA(adj) in 50-band data to retrieve the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and leaf area index (LAI) of the crops.\n\nThe results showed that the estimation accuracy of singular crop parameters, particularly the crop LAI, was greatly improved by the machine learning methods when using the ALA(adj) datasets. The root mean square error (RMSE) values for CCC and LAI estimations were significantly reduced compared to estimations without using ALA(adj).\n\nFor mixed crops, the machine learning algorithms using ALA(adj) datasets resulted in more accurate estimations of CCC and LAI compared to estimations without ALA(adj). The RMSE values for CCC and LAI were lower when ALA(adj) was incorporated, indicating improved accuracy in estimating these crop parameters.\n\nOverall, incorporating ALA(adj) values using machine learning algorithms enhanced the estimation accuracy of crop parameters, particularly for"
