        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of crop row detection in the proposed weed mapping system using imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in precision agriculture is to simplify the separation between weeds and crops. Since crops are typically organized in rows, identifying and detecting these rows can help differentiate between the crops and the weeds in the image. This information is then used to improve the accuracy of the weed mapping process, allowing for more precise and timely weed control treatments based on weed coverage."
