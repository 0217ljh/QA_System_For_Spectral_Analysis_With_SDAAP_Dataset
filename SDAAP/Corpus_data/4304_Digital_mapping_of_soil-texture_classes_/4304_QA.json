The related study focuses on evaluating the performance of three different machine-learning models (RF, SVR, and XGBoost) in estimating soil-texture fractions using Landsat 8 spectral bands and a digital elevation model (DEM). The results show that the XGBoost model performed better than the RF and SVR models in estimating soil-texture fractions."
