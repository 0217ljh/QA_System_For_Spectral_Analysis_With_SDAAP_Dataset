        "Output": "Yes. Based on the findings of the study, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for assessing the microbiological quality of chicken liver. The past study explored the feasibility of using FTIR to evaluate the behavior of spoilage microbiota and inoculated Salmonella enterica on chicken liver. The developed FTIR spectral analysis workflow, which included data normalization, feature selection, and support vector machine regression analysis, showed promising results in estimating the different spoilage microbial groups. The performance of the models developed using FTIR was evaluated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R-2), bias (B-f), and accuracy (A(f)) factors. The results demonstrated that the proposed models exhibited good accuracy and precision in predicting the microbial counts of various microorganisms on chicken liver samples. Therefore, FTIR technology, in combination with the proposed spectral analysis workflow, can be considered a superior method for assessing the microbiological quality of chicken liver compared to traditional methods."
