        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the models comparing SOC predictions using pXRF measured data and the Cubist algorithm is the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R-2). These metrics provide a measure of the accuracy, precision, and goodness-of-fit of the models. \n\nThe extent to which these metrics can go in evaluating the models depends on the specific context and requirements of the study. In this particular study, the MAE, RMSE, and R-2 values were used to compare the performance of three different Cubist models. The lower the MAE and RMSE values, and the higher the R-2 value, the better the model is considered to be."

Three Cubist models were applied, namely Cubist 1, Cubist 2, and Cubist 3. \n\nCubist 1 utilized all thirteen predictors (K, Ca, Rb, Mn, Fe, As, Ba, Th, Pb, Sr, Ti, Zr, and Zn) and yielded the best model outcome, with an MAE of 0.51%, RMSE of 0.68%, and R-2 of 0.78. \n\nCubist 2 used predictors with relatively high importance (VarImp. predictors) and had slightly lower performance, with an MAE of 0.64%, RMSE of 0.82%, and R-2 of 0.68. \n\nCubist 3 utilized predictors showing a significantly positive correlation and had the lowest performance, with an MAE of 0.69%, RMSE of 0.90%, and R-2"

        "Output": "Yes, the Cubist 1 model, which utilized all predictors, can be considered superior to traditional methods in estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) using portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) measured data in the related study comparing different Cubist models. The results of the study showed that the Cubist 1 model had the best model outcome, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.68%, and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.78. These performance metrics indicate that the Cubist 1 model had the lowest error and highest explanatory power compared to the other Cubist models tested. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Cubist 1 model is superior in estimating SOC using pXRF measured data in the related study."
