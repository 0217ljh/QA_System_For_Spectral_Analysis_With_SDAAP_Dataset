This enhances the ability to differentiate between different waste types, leading to more accurate classification.\n\nIn addition to the characteristic reflectivity, the method also extracts four potential features, including the first derivative and the intrinsic mode function (IMF). These features improve the ability to distinguish similar spectra, making the method more robust in complex conditions.\n\nThe method employs the random forest (RF) algorithm and the extreme learning machine (ELM) to identify trend-features and amplitude-features respectively. This combination of algorithms improves the accuracy of identification and reduces errors caused by working conditions.\n\nOverall, the proposed method using near-infrared hyperspectral technology offers a more advanced and efficient approach to identifying and classifying construction waste.
