        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the reliability of the classification models was accuracy. The accuracy metric measures the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. In the related study, the accuracy of the classification models was reported to be higher than 0.90, indicating a high level of reliability in predicting the eggs feeding groups. However, the specific range or extent to which the accuracy metric can go was not mentioned in the provided text."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The selected NIR wavelengths were used in the supervised classification algorithms to discriminate among table eggs from quails fed with different levels of silkworm pupa meal (SWM) inclusion by using the following machine learning models: partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) linear and radial. These models utilized the informative NIR wavelengths to classify the eggs into their respective feeding groups based on the spectral data obtained from the NIR devices."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study found that both the VIS/NIR and NIR devices had a moderate predictive capacity in discriminating among table eggs from quails fed with different levels of silkworm pupa meal (SWM) inclusion. However, the accuracy of the VIS-NIR portable tool was lower than 0.73, indicating that it had worse predictive capacity compared to the NIR benchtop and portable devices. The most informative NIR wavelengths for classification belonged to the 1350-1600 and 1850-2200 nm spectral regions. Overall, when the SWM4-12 experimental groups were merged, both the NIR benchtop and portable devices, combined with advanced machine learning models, successfully recognized the inclusion of insect meal in the eggs with an accuracy higher than 0.90."
