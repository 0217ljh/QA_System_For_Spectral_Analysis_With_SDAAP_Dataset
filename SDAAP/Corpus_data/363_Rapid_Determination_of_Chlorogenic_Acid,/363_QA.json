        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) combined with variable selection and multivariate calibration methods can be considered a superior tool compared to traditional methods for the rapid determination of chlorogenic acid, luteoloside, and 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid in Chrysanthemum. The past study found that the best performance was achieved by using back propagation-artificial neural networks (BP-ANN) models based on variables selected by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) for all three chemical constituents. The correlation coefficients of prediction (r(p)(2)) were high (0.924, 0.927, 0.933), indicating a strong relationship between the NIR spectroscopy data and the reference values determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values were low (0.033, 0.018, 0.064), indicating accurate predictions. Additionally, the values of RPD (residual predictive deviation) were above 2, indicating good prediction ability. These results suggest that NIR spectroscopy combined with variable selection and multivariate calibration methods can provide a rapid and reliable determination of these chemical constituents in Chrysanthemum."
