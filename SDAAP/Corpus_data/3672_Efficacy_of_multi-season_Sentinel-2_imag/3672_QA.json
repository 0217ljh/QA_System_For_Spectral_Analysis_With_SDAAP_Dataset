        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of SWIR spectral bands captured during spring, greenness indices captured during spring, and tasselled cap transformations derived from the autumn image can be used as a superior spectroscopic method in mapping complex compositional classifications of vegetation at fine spatial scales. The study found that this multi-temporal feature set sufficiently captured the phenological differences between the vegetation classes and produced the best results compared to other feature sets. The results showed that Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Nearest Neighbour (NN) classifiers, using this feature set, returned statistically superior results compared to Random Forests (RF) and Classification Trees (CT). Therefore, it can be concluded that this combination of spectral bands, indices, and transformations has the potential to accurately predict compositional vegetation classes using multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery."
