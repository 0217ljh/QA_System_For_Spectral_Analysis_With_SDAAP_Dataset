        "Output": "Yes, based on the information provided in the text, the Stacked AdaBoost ensemble learning model can be considered as a superior method for mapping soil heavy metal concentrations compared to traditional machine learning models. The text states that the Stacked AdaBoost model showed higher accuracy in predicting heavy metal concentrations compared to traditional machine learning models. Specifically, for Cr, Cu, and As, the determination coefficients (R2) of the verification set were 0.66, 0.61, and 0.74, respectively. This indicates that the Stacked AdaBoost model performed better in accurately predicting the heavy metal concentrations in the soil."
