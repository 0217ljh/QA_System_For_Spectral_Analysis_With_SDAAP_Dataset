        "input": "",
        "Output": "Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for the efficient nondestructive detection of heavy metal pollutants in soil. The past study found that THz spectroscopy was able to accurately detect and quantify the presence of mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu) in soils. The absorption coefficients at selected frequency points showed a regular increase in the THz spectral range, indicating a strong correlation between heavy metal contents and THz absorption. The probabilistic neural network (PNN) and random forest (RF) models used for qualitative detection demonstrated high accuracy, with the PNN model performing better on average. The backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model and extreme learning machine (ELM) used for quantitative prediction of heavy metal content also showed promising results, with the BPNN model exhibiting better prediction performance. The decision coefficients (DC) and root mean square errors (RMSE) of the BPNN model further supported its effectiveness in predicting heavy metal content. Overall, the past study suggests that THz spectroscopy has good qualitative and quantitative detection abilities for heavy metal pollutants in soil, offering new opportunities for efficient and nondestructive detection compared to traditional methods."
