The R-2 values for the five growth periods of potato were 0.833, 0.764, 0.791, 0.664, and 0.435, respectively. \n\nIn terms of accuracy and stability, the R-2 values indicate the proportion of the variance in the PNC data that can be explained by the model. A higher R-2 value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. The best result of RMSE can reach 0.2866%"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the results of the research, the combination of vegetation indices (VIs) and high-frequency information (HFI) can be considered as a superior spectroscopic method for estimating plant nitrogen content (PNC) in different growth periods of potato crops. The research showed that the accuracy and stability of the PNC estimation model constructed with VIs+HFI as model variables were higher than that of a single VIs and HFI. Additionally, the modeling R-2 values and RMSE values for each growth period indicated that the PNC estimation model using VIs+HFI had a better effect compared to other methods. Therefore, the combination of VIs and HFI can provide new technical support for real-time and efficient potato nitrogen nutrition status detection."
