        "Output": "Yes, based on the results of the related study on the VEN\u788cS mission, the machine learning method can be considered superior to the index-based approach in accurately detecting snow cover without the use of a shortwave infrared band. The study found that the machine learning method provided better results compared to the index-based approach, with a lower root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.35% for the machine learning method compared to 10.80% for the index-based method in the High Atlas region. The improvement was more evident in the Pyrenees, possibly due to the presence of vegetation which complicates the spectral signature of the snow cover area in VEN\u788cS images."
