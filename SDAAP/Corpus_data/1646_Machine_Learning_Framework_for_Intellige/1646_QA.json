The study suggests that these methodologies, in combination with the adaptive selection of informative spectral wavelength variables, can enhance the accuracy of the NIR calibration model. The biLSSVM method was found to be the best for testing the model, while the siLSSVM method was the best for training the model. Therefore, the proposed deep learning methodologies are feasible for improving the prediction results in the rapid determination of wastewater MIS content using IoT-based NIR technology."
