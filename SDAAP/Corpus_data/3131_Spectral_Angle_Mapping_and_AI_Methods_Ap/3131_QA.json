        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed combined system using a multispectral image capturing camera mounted on a drone along with Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be considered superior to traditional methods for remote identification of magnetite iron sands in mining and mineral engineering practices. The study found that at a flight elevation of 20 meters, the system achieved a global classification accuracy of 99.7% and a per-class precision of 99.4%. These performance ratios suggest that the system is highly effective in accurately classifying magnetite iron sand. Additionally, the use of drones allows for remote data collection, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing efficiency in mining environments. Therefore, the positive outputs of this study indicate the viability and superiority of the proposed combined system in mining and mineral engineering practices."
