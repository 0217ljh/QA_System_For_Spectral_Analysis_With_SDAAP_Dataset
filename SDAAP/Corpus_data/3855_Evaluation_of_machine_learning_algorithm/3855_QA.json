        "Output": "The machine learning algorithms were applied to obtain forest stand species maps for large areas in the Polish Carpathian Mountains by using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 products and environmental data. The study utilized three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). \n\nTo develop the workflow, the researchers assessed the importance of 114 variables, including three Sentinel-2 Best Available Pixel composites (April, July, and October), eight annual spectral-temporal metrics (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range, first quartile, third quartile, and interquartile range), and four environmental topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, distance to water bodies). \n\nVariable importance techniques, such as Variable Importance Using Random Forests (VSURF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), were used to determine the significance of these variables. \n\nBased on the variable importance assessment, the researchers produced maps of eleven tree species using the three machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, and XGB) on nine different variable subsets, resulting in a total of 27 classifications. \n\nThe results showed that SVM outperformed the other two classifiers, with the highest overall accuracy exceeding 85%."
