The research utilized the advantages of satellite imagery, such as global coverage, low cost, temporal stability, and spectral extent, while leveraging the higher resolution of hyperspatial sUAS imagery for training and validating the mapping analytics. By combining the detailed and fine spatial resolution of sUAS imagery with the broader coverage and other advantages of satellite imagery, researchers can obtain more accurate and temporally adequate assessments of the effects of wildland fires on the environment. This enhanced accuracy can help in improving the use of wildland fire as a tool for restoring ecosystem resilience."
