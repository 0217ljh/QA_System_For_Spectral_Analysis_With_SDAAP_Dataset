        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study integrated optical temporal data with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data by using vegetation indices derived from both types of data. Specifically, the modified soil adjusted vegetation index 2 (MSAVI2) was derived from optical data, while the radar vegetation index (RVI) was derived from SAR data. These indices were used to prepare temporal indices databases. Three different combinations of MSAVI2 and RVI layers, corresponding to different phenological stages of the psyllium husk crop, were studied to determine the effectiveness of different sensors for crop mapping."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The introduction of SAR-based vegetation index as a temporal layer was found to be effective in mapping the medicinal crop psyllium husk in Jalore district of Rajasthan, India. The study used three different temporal layer combinations of MSAVI2 and RVI layers, corresponding to different phenological stages of the target crop. The results showed that the introduction of SAR-based vegetation index as a temporal layer gave good results for fully vegetated and harvest stages of the target crop. The variance within the mapped fields was observed to be as low as 0.0003."
