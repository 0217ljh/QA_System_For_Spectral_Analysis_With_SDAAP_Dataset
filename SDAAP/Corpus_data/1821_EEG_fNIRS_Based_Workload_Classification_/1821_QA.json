        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of bivariate functional brain connectivity (FBC) features in EEG recording can be considered superior to univariate power spectral density (PSD) features in classifying multi-level mental workload using the proposed framework that combines hybrid EEG-fNIRS features with machine learning. The paper states that the FBC technique significantly improved classification performance, achieving 77% accuracy for 0-back vs. 2-back and 83% accuracy for 0-back vs. 3-back using a public dataset. This indicates that the FBC features are more effective in distinguishing different levels of mental workload compared to the traditional univariate PSD features."
