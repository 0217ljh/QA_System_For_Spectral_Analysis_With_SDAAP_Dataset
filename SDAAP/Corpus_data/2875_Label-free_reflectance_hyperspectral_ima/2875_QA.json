        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the study's findings, the label-free hyperspectral imaging (HSI) approach can be considered superior to traditional imaging methods for tumor margin assessment in surgical tissue specimens of head and neck cancer patients. The HSI method achieved an average accuracy of 90% +/- 8% for distinguishing between cancer and normal tissue from the oral cavity, and an average accuracy of 94% +/- 6% for tissue specimens from the thyroid. In comparison, autofluorescence imaging or fluorescence imaging with vital dye (2-NBDG or proflavine) did not perform as well. Therefore, the HSI approach shows promise for improving tumor margin assessment in surgical procedures for head and neck cancer patients."
