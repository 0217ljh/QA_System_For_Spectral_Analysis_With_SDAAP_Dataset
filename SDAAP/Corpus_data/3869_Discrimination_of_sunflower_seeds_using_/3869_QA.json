The models used were deep learning J4, support vector machine, random committee, and Bayes net. These models were employed to optimize the multi-feature dataset obtained from the preprocessing stage. The dataset consisted of 53 multi-features extracted from each region of the sunflower seeds. Additionally, the chi-square feature selection technique was applied to select 11 optimized fused multi-features. The accuracies achieved by the models were 98.2% for deep learning J4, 97.5% for support vector machine, 96.6% for random committee, and 94.8% for Bayes net."
