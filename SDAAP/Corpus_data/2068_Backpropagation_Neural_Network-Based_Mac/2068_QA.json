        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction accuracy of blood urea and glucose in the related study is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE values obtained for blood urea and glucose are 0.88 mg/dL and 12.01 mg/dL, respectively. \n\nThe RMSE is a measure of the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It provides an indication of how well the model's predictions align with the true values. A lower RMSE indicates a higher level of accuracy in the predictions.\n\nIn terms of how far this metric can go, it is important to note that the RMSE values mentioned in the study are specific to the dataset and model used in this research. The RMSE values may vary depending on the specific dataset, model architecture, and other factors. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the context and limitations of the study when interpreting the RMSE values."

The Coefficient of Determination R-2 was 0.93 for blood urea and 0.97 for glucose, with an accuracy of 94.2% and 90.14%, respectively.\n\nTo further improve the prediction accuracy, the BP-ANN model was applied. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was first applied to the spectra values, and these PCA values were then used to train and validate the BP-ANN model. \n\nAfter applying the BP-ANN model, the prediction of blood urea improved remarkably, achieving an RMSE of 0.69 mg/dL, R-2 of 0.96, and an accuracy of 95.96%. Similarly, the prediction of glucose also improved significantly, with an RMSE of 2.06 mg/dL"
