        "Output": "Yes, the use of UAV-based high-resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR data can be considered superior to traditional methods in estimating seed protein and oil compositions of soybean and corn. The study found that UAV hyperspectral imagery can successfully predict both the protein and oil of soybean and corn with moderate accuracies. Additionally, the combination of hyperspectral and LiDAR data outperformed the predictions using a single sensor alone. The results showed that the use of multisensory data fusion and automated machine learning with UAV-based data can provide more accurate estimations of crop-seed composition compared to traditional methods."
