        "instruction": "How did the researchers utilize the MSLC-ANN technique to improve the accuracy of compositional analysis in LIBS analysis?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers utilized the MSLC-ANN technique by first preparing eight samples with different known concentrations of Cu, Zn, Sn, Pb, and Si, where aluminium was used as a base metal. They then measured the line intensities of these samples using LIBS analysis. To reduce uncertainties in the line intensity measurements, the observed line intensities were normalized with the base aluminium metal. \n\nThe intensity ratios of the target and matrix elements were used to train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN was trained to predict the concentrations of the target samples based on the intensity ratios. \n\nBy using the MSLC-ANN technique, the researchers were able to improve the accuracy of the quantitative analysis of the compositional results. The compositions obtained using MSLC-ANN showed an excellent agreement with the certified compositions, as compared to the compositions obtained using a calibration curve (CC-LIBS) analysis. This demonstrates that the optimized ANN is an excellent tool for compositional analysis of alloys, soil, and other multi-elemental samples. It can also be used for quality control in alloys and mining industries."
