        "Output": "The utilization of hyperspectral remote sensing technology and deep learning algorithms assists in improving safety production in mining areas by providing accurate and efficient feature information extraction. \n\nHyperspectral remote sensing technology, specifically Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image (HRSI) technology, has high spectral resolution and many bands. This allows for the extraction of specific bands to highlight target features. By comprehensively utilizing the data spectrum information and spatial information of HRSIs, deep learning algorithms, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can be employed for feature extraction.\n\nThe CNN model learns from the data and automatically obtains data features, which can then guide the classification of features. In the context of mining areas, this means that ground features can be extracted and classified using CNN models. For example, in the Liuyuan research area in Gansu, three CNN models (VGG-19, VGG-16, and ResNet) were used to extract and classify ground features. The VGG-19 model achieved a classification accuracy rate of 87.3%, the VGG-16 model achieved a classification accuracy rate of 95.2% for the ground in the mining area, and the ResNet model had the best effect on road classification."
