        "Output": "In the study on the rapid and non-destructive detection of genuine Thai Jasmine rice using near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIRHSI), machine learning techniques and deep learning approaches were utilized to analyze the data and classify the rice samples.\n\nFor milled rice, the spectral imaging-based analysis on the NIR-HSI data with selected wavelengths was used. This analysis was performed using either a convolutional neural network or a support vector machine (SVM) model. The best classification accuracy achieved for milled rice was approximately 95% for the test set using either of these machine learning techniques.\n\nFor brown rice, the SVM model was used based on the averaged NIR spectra. This approach achieved the best classification accuracy of 95.4% for brown rice. The study suggests that the chemical component difference and its spatial distribution in milled rice contribute to higher classification accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that the surface bran effects of brown rice could be reduced by using averaged spectral data coupled with the SVM method. This indicates that the combination of machine learning techniques and deep learning approaches can effectively analyze the NIRHSI data and accurately classify genuine Thai Jasmine rice samples."

The study found that the best classification accuracy for milled rice was achieved using this approach, with approximately 95% accuracy for the test set. This accuracy was achieved using either a convolutional neural network or a support vector machine model. In comparison, traditional methods did not achieve such high accuracy levels. For brown rice, the study found that the SVM model based on averaged NIR spectra achieved the best classification accuracy of 95.4%. This suggests that the chemical component difference and spatial distribution in milled rice contribute to higher classification accuracy, and the surface bran effects of brown rice can be reduced by using averaged spectral data coupled with the SVM method. Overall, the use of spectral imaging-based analysis on NIR-HSI data with selected wavelengths provides a more accurate and efficient method for detecting genuine Thai Jasmine rice compared to traditional methods."
