        "input": "",
        "Output": "Linear and non-linear regression models, multivariate techniques, and machine learning algorithms were used for predicting the whole season green area index in winter wheat based on multispectral data. Additionally, different predictors were implemented in these models, including multispectral data as raw bands and as ratios."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictions of the green area index was the correlation between the integrated values of predicted green area indices and the final biomass. The results showed a high correlation between the predicted green area indices and the final biomass, with R-2 values of 0.84 for the VIQUO model and 0.85 for the SVM model. This indicates that the predictions were accurate and reliable in estimating the process of radiation interception and the determining factors of crop growth."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The linear model using all four wavebands provided by the sensor in three ratios (VIQUO) is compared to other spectroscopic methods in predicting the whole season green area index in winter wheat using the drone-based multispectral system. It is found that the VIQUO-model is recommended as the best model, as it is precise but still relatively simple, thus easier to communicate and apply than other methods such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The VIQUO-model has a high correlation with the final biomass (R-2: VIQUO = 0.84), indicating a robust model calibration and a high potential of the tested multispectral system for agricultural research and crop management."
