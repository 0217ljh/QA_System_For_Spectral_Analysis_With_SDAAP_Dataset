        "input": "",
        "Output": "The regression models using the full spectra and optimal wavenumbers obtained good results, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of calibration and prediction all over 0.9 and the predictive residual deviation (RPD) over 3. \n\nThe coefficient of determination (R-2) is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (adulteration content) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectra or wavenumbers). An R-2 value of 0.9 suggests that 90% of the variation in the adulteration content can be explained by the models.\n\nThe predictive residual deviation (RPD) is a measure of the ratio between the standard deviation of the reference values and the standard error of prediction. An RPD value over 3 indicates a good prediction accuracy.The chosen metric for evaluating the detection of adulterations in the milk powder is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the predictive residual deviation (RPD).

        "Output": "Mid-infrared spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional techniques for detecting adulterations of rice flour and soybean flour in milk powder. The study found that mid-infrared spectroscopy, when combined with classification and regression models such as Partial Least Squares (PLS), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), achieved good results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, coefficient of determination (R-2), and predictive residual deviation (RPD). The technique was able to effectively detect the adulterations and determine their content with high accuracy. Therefore, mid-infrared spectroscopy can be seen as an effective and reliable technique for detecting rice flour and soybean flour adulterations in milk powder."
