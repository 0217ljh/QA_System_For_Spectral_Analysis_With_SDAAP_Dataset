        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the DSM in the research is the Kappa index. The Kappa index is a statistical measure that assesses the agreement between the observed classifications (DSM) and the expected classifications (actual soil types). It takes into account both the overall accuracy of the classification and the agreement that is beyond what would be expected by chance alone.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the Kappa index can provide a measure of how well the DSM represents the actual soil types in the study area. A Kappa index of 1 indicates perfect agreement between the DSM and the actual soil types, while a value of 0 indicates no agreement beyond what would be expected by chance. \n\nIn this research, the DSM achieved a Kappa index of 73%. This means that there is a substantial agreement between the DSM and the actual soil types, indicating that the DSM is reasonably accurate in representing the pedodiversity of the study area. However, it is important to note that there is still room for improvement, as there is a 27% discrepancy between the DSM and the actual soil types. Therefore, the researchers suggest including subsoil data and other features using other sensors in operations modeled by machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of the DSM."

        "Output": "The ASTER time series modeling technique can be used to improve the accuracy of the digital soil map (DSM) in terms of representing the pedodiversity of the study area by extrapolating multispectral data from a source area to a target area. In this technique, an ASTER time series, consisting of multiple satellite images taken at different times (in this case, 2001, 2004, and 2006), is processed. This processing generates a bare soil synthetic soil image (SySI) that covers a significant portion of the target area.\n\nTo further enhance the accuracy of the DSM, the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis is applied. This analysis models the spectral library (SL), which is created by grouping the soil spectra based on their texture through cluster analysis. The SL represents the main features and shapes typical of tropical soils.\n\nBy applying the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis to the SySI, the DSM is generated. The DSM obtained in this study achieved a Kappa index of 73%, indicating a relatively high level of agreement between the predicted soil classes and the actual soil profiles analyzed. The DSM accurately identified about 77% of the study area as being covered by rhodic Ferralsols, which are typical of tropical regions.\n\nHowever, it is"
