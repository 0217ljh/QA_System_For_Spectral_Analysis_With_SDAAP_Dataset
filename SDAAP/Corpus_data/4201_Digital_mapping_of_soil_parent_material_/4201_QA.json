Terrain derivatives: This scenario involved using various terrain attributes such as slope, aspect, curvature, and elevation as covariates.\n\n2. Hydrologic covariates: This scenario incorporated hydrological variables such as flow accumulation, drainage density, and stream network as covariates.\n\n3. Topsoil spectral reflectance: This scenario utilized spectral reflectance data from the topsoil to predict soil parent material.\n\n4. Spatial coordinates: This scenario considered the spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the study area as covariates.\n\nAdditionally, a bare soil image, created using 30 years of Landsat data, was evaluated as a covariate to predict soil parent material."
