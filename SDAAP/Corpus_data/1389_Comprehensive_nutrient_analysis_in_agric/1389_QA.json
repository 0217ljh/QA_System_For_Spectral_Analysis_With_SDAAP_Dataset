        "Output": "Machine learning methods were utilized in the assessment of portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transformed Mid-Infrared (DRIFT-MIR) spectroscopy for the analysis of total Carbon, Nitrogen, and total elemental composition of multiple elements in organic amendments by developing models to rapidly quantify the concentrations of macro- and micronutrient elements present in the samples. Two types of machine learning methods, forest regression and extreme gradient boosting, were used with data from both pXRF and DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy. Cross-validation trials were run to evaluate the generalizability of the models produced on each instrument. These machine learning methods demonstrated similar broad capabilities in estimating nutrients, with pXRF being suitable for nutrients and contaminants. The results suggest that portable spectrometry in combination with machine learning can provide a scalable solution for comprehensive nutrient analysis of organic amendments."
