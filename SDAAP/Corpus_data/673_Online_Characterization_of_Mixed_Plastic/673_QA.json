        "Output": "The researchers used a sensing framework that combined a convolutional neural network (CNN) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) to achieve a high overall prediction accuracy for the characterization of mixed plastic wastes (MPW) in real-time. They placed the MPW samples on a moving platform to simulate the industrial environment. The MIR spectra were collected at a rate of 100 Hz. The CNN architecture was then used to analyze the collected MIR spectra and make predictions about the composition of the MPW samples. The proposed method demonstrated an overall prediction accuracy close to 100%, indicating its effectiveness in accurately characterizing MPW in real-time. This approach paves the way for online MPW characterization in industrial applications that require high throughput."
