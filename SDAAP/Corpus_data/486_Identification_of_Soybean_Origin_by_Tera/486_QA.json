        "Output": "Yes. The combination of iPLS optimized THz spectroscopy and chemometrics can be considered a superior method for accurately identifying the origin of soybeans compared to traditional methods. The experimental results showed that after iPLS optimization and appropriate pre-processing techniques, the comprehensive identification accuracy rate of the ABC-SVM model reached 94.74%. This indicates that the combination of iPLS optimized THz spectroscopy and chemometrics is highly effective in accurately identifying the origin of soybeans."
