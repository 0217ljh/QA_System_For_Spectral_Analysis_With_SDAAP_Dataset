This approach aims to utilize the capabilities of machine learning algorithms and remote sensing data to accurately identify and classify different lithologies in the specific geological and geographical conditions of the semi-arid area in Duolun County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. By integrating multiple sources of remote sensing data and applying advanced classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the model aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lithology classification, which can be valuable for geological studies, resource exploration, and land management in the area."

        "Output": "The SDIF-PSO algorithm is compared to other optimization algorithms in terms of its capability to improve the accuracy of lithology classification using multi-source remote sensing data in a specific geological area in China. The experimental results showed that the SDIF-PSO algorithm had the best optimization capability, with the highest cross-validation accuracy of 90.90%. This accuracy was improved by 3.85% compared to the Grid-Search Optimization (GSO) algorithm, and by 0.15% compared to the improved PSO algorithm with the Inertia Factor changing with the Linear Decreasing function (LDIF-PSO) and the improved PSO algorithm with the Inertia Factor Decreasing with the Concave function (CDIF-PSO). Additionally, the dimension of the best feature combination was reduced to 35 through feature selection, and the convergence cross-validation accuracy reached 92.14% using the SDIF-PSO algorithm. This accuracy was improved by 1.24% compared to using all 63-dimensional candidate features in the same optimization process with the SDIF-PSO algorithm. Therefore, the SDIF-PSO algorithm outperformed other optimization algorithms in improving the accuracy of lithology classification in the specific geological area in China."
