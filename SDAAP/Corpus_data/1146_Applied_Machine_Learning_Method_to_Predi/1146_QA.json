        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the SVM's performance in predicting disorder severity was the sensitivity, specificity, and overall discrimination rate. The sensitivity of the SVM was 88.71%, indicating the proportion of correctly identified children with ADHD. The specificity was 83.78%, indicating the proportion of correctly identified typically developing children. The overall discrimination rate was 86.25%, indicating the overall accuracy of the SVM in distinguishing between children with ADHD and typically developing children."

        "Output": "The data collected from children with ADHD and typically developing children to train the machine learning model in establishing biomarkers for ADHD included behavioral and physiological indicators, age, and reverse Stroop task (RST) data. Additionally, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to quantify the change in prefrontal cortex oxygenated hemoglobin during the RST."
