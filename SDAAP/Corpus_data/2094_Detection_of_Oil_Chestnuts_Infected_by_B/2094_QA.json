        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes,based on the satisfactory performances achieved by the BPNN and ENN models using both full spectra and optimal wavelengths in this study, it can be concluded that near-infrared hyperspectral imaging is a superior method compared to traditional methods for detecting mildew damage in chestnuts caused by blue mold. The classification accuracies of both models surpassed 99%, indicating the potential for rapid and non-destructive detection of moldy chestnuts. This suggests that hyperspectral imaging can be used to develop an online detection system for distinguishing healthy and blue mold infected chestnuts."
