        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models were used in the retrieval process of temperatures and species concentrations from spectral infrared emission measurements in combustion systems by training them with synthesized spectra calculated from HITEMP 2010 for gas mixtures of CO2, H2O, and CO. These trained models were then used to analyze the measured spectral emission from a Hencken flat flame burner with different spectral resolutions. The models were able to retrieve the temperature fields above the burner for combustion with different equivalence ratios and showed excellent agreement with temperatures deduced from Rayleigh scattering thermometry."

Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the machine learning approach using spectral infrared emission measurements offers a superior alternative to traditional methods for retrieving temperatures and species concentrations in combustion systems. The study mentions that machine learning approaches allow for solving highly nonlinear problems and offer good flexibility in dealing with complex and dynamic systems.
