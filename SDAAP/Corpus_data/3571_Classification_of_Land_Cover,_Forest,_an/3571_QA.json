        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of multiple source data, including spectral bands, vegetation indices, textures, and topographic factors, significantly improved the accuracy of land cover and forest classification compared to using spectral bands alone. This suggests that incorporating additional data sources provides more comprehensive information for classification.\n\nCombining leaf-on and leaf-off seasonal images further enhanced the classification accuracies. The combination of these two types of images improved the accuracy by 7.8% to 15.0% for land cover classes and by 6.0% to 11.8% for forest classes compared to using a single season spectral image. This indicates that considering the seasonal variations in vegetation can provide more accurate classification results.\n\nOverall, the combination of multiple source data and the integration of seasonal images resulted in improved land cover classification by 3.7% to 15.5% and forest classification by 1.0% to 12.7% compared to using spectral images alone. This highlights the importance of considering various data sources and seasonal variations in order to achieve higher classification accuracies in mapping land cover and forest distribution."
