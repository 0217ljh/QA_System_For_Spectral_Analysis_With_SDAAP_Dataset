        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the detection performance in this study is the F-score. The F-score is a measure of the accuracy of a binary classification model, which takes into account both precision and recall. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. \n\nThe F-score can range from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating perfect detection performance. In this study, the F-score exceeded 93%, indicating a high level of accuracy in detecting multiscale flaws in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The developed heterogeneous sensor data fusion approach for detecting multiscale flaws in LPBF additive manufacturing outperforms traditional methods. Traditional methods typically focus on detecting a specific type of flaw using signals from one type of sensor and are trained on data from simple cuboid and cylindrical-shaped coupons. However, these traditional methods have limited success when used for detecting multiscale flaws in complex LPBF parts. \n\nIn contrast, the developed approach utilizes data from multiple sensors, including an infrared camera, spatter imaging camera, and optical powder bed imaging camera. This heterogeneous thermo-optical sensor data is processed using spectral graph-based process signatures, which are then used as inputs to simple machine learning models. \n\nThe results of the developed approach show a statistical fidelity exceeding 93% (F-score) in detecting porosity, layer-level distortion, and geometry-related flaws. This indicates that the developed approach is highly effective in detecting multiscale flaws across different LPBF part geometries and build conditions. Therefore, the developed heterogeneous sensor data fusion approach is superior to traditional methods in detecting multiscale flaws in LPBF additive manufacturing."
