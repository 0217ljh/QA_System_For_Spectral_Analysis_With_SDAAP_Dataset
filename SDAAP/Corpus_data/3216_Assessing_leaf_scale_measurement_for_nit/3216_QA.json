These classifiers were used to assess the potential of spectral measurements obtained from leaf scale and machine learning approaches for quantifying oil palm N status. \n\nIn terms of classifying N status of immature and mature oil palms, the study found that both DA and SVM classifiers could achieve reasonable accuracies. The DA classifier, with a larger number of optimal spectral bands, was able to discriminate N sufficiency levels of all maturity classes with higher accuracies compared to the SVM classifier."

        "Output": "The discriminant analysis (DA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were effective in discriminating spectral bands sensitive to N sufficiency levels for quantifying oil palm N status. The related study found that both classifiers had age-dependent discriminant functions. The DA classifier, with a larger number of optimal spectral bands, was able to discriminate N sufficiency levels of all maturity classes with higher accuracies compared to the SVM classifier. However, the SVM classifier was still able to produce reasonable accuracies with a lesser number of spectral bands. This suggests that both classifiers have potential as rapid tools for assessing oil palm N status."
