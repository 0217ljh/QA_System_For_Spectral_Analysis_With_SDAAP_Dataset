        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study on building a diagnostic model of mental state through the simultaneous classification of mental workload and acute stress was functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The fNIRS metric was able to predict mental workload level accurately, with the best accuracy resulting from the combination of fNIRS and electrocardiography (ECG). Stress level could not be accurately diagnosed through ECG alone, only with fNIRS or ECG and fNIRS combined. Individual calibration may be important for stress classification accuracy, particularly for those with higher subjective state anxiety."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes.Based on the information provided in the text, spectroscopic methods, specifically functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), were used in combination with electrocardiography (ECG) to build a diagnostic model of mental state. The model's classifiers were able to disentangle variations of mental workload from variations of acute stress with above-chance accuracy. Both fNIRS and ECG were able to predict mental workload level, with the best accuracy resulting from the combination of the two measures. However, stress level could only be accurately diagnosed through fNIRS or the combination of fNIRS and ECG, not ECG alone. \n\nBased on this information, it can be inferred that spectroscopic methods, specifically fNIRS, were effective in building a diagnostic model of mental state for the simultaneous classification of mental workload and acute stress. Therefore, spectroscopic methods can be considered superior to traditional methods in this specific context."
