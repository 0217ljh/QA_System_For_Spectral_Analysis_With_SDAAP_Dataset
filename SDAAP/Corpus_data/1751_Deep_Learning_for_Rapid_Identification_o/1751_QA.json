        "Output": "Deep learning algorithms were applied in the rapid detection of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes using metabolomics data by training multilayer (deep) artificial neural networks (ANN) on the data. The microbes were incubated for 4 hours in a protein-free defined medium, followed by 1D H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements. The NMR spectra were analyzed by spectral binning in an untargeted metabolomics approach. The trained ANN models were then used to predict spectra of unknown microbes. The ANN predicted unknown microbes in the laboratory setting with an average accuracy of 99.2% when using a simple feature selection method."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The deep learning approach, using multilayer artificial neural networks (ANN), outperformed traditional methods such as random forest models and support vector machines in the rapid detection of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes using metabolomics data. The ANN models trained on the data achieved an average accuracy of 99.2% in predicting spectra of unknown microbes in the laboratory setting. This performance was consistently higher than the other current data analysis methods, highlighting the potential of deep learning in metabolomics data analysis for microbial detection."
