        "Output": "Yes, the machine learning algorithms described in the paper can be applied to classify spectra in other fields of research beyond fruits, whiskies, and teas. The paper mentions that the approach can be used with various types of spectra, such as FTIR, mass spectra, UV-visible, Raman, and NMR. This means that the algorithms can be applied to classify spectra in fields such as pharmaceuticals, environmental analysis, materials science, and many others. The flexibility of the approach allows for its adaptation to different research areas and the classification of various types of spectra."
