        "Output": "Yes, the proposed hybrid method using genetic algorithms and a random forest algorithm can be used to compare the effectiveness of spectral features in estimating the total height of individual trees with traditional methods. The study used a dataset of 189 environmental variables, including spectral variables, to fit models of individual tree heights. The hybrid method was compared with a mixed-effects model and a random forest model, and its performance was evaluated using various metrics. Therefore, the proposed hybrid method can be used to assess the effectiveness of spectral features in estimating tree height and compare it with traditional methods."
