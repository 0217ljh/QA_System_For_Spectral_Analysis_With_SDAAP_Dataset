        "input": "",
        "Output": "For classifying and quantifying adulterated mutton under the effect of mutton flavour essence, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) was used to explore the global optimal parameters of the machine learning models. The SSA is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the behavior of sparrows in searching for food. It mimics the social behavior of sparrows, where they communicate and share information to find the best food sources.\n\nTo utilize SSA in optimizing the parameters, the researchers applied it to the back propagation neural network (BP), extreme learning machine (ELM), and support vector machine/regression (SVM/SVR) models. SSA iteratively searches for the optimal parameter values by updating the positions of the sparrows in the search space.\n\nDuring the optimization process, the SSA evaluates the performance of the models using a fitness function, which measures the accuracy or prediction capability of the models. The algorithm then adjusts the positions of the sparrows based on their fitness values, aiming to find the global optimal parameters that yield the best performance for the classification and quantification of mutton adulteration.\n\nBy incorporating SSA in the parameter optimization process, the performance of the machine learning models improved, leading to more accurate classification and quantification results for mutton adulteration under the influence of mutton flavor essence."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI), machine learning (ML), and the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) can be considered superior to traditional methods for classifying and quantifying adulterated mutton under the effect of mutton flavour essence. The study proposes using NIR-HSI combined with ML and SSA to establish classification and quantification models for adulterated mutton. The results showed that the performance of these models improved after optimization using SSA. The SSA-SVM model achieved an accuracy of 99.79% in the prediction set, while the SSA-SVR model achieved an R-P(2) of 0.9304 and an RMSEP of 0.0458 g.g(-1). Therefore, this combination of techniques provides a feasible approach for evaluating and supervising food quality under complex conditions."
