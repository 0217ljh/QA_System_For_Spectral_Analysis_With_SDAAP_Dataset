        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction models was the coefficient of determination (R^2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The random forest (RF) model achieved the highest accuracy with a coefficient of determination of 0.963 and a root mean square error of 0.489 (g/hundred-grain weight). This indicates that the RF model performed very well in predicting maize grain yields."
