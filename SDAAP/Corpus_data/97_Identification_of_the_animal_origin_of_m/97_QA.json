        "Output": "Investigating the use of Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for the classification of milk samples based on animal origin, machine learning algorithms were used to analyze the corresponding spectra and classify the samples. The researchers selected different machine learning algorithms and applied them to the LIBS spectra of 1296 raw liquid milk samples and 683 lyophilized powdered samples.\n\nThe machine learning algorithms were trained using the selected spectral features related to milk's mineral content. These features were used to construct predictive models for the classification of the milk samples. The models were then evaluated to assess their performance in accurately classifying the samples based on the animal origin.\n\nThe predictive accuracies of the models were calculated using unknown milk samples. It reported that when using the entire LIBS spectra, the achieved predictive accuracies were as high as 92.8% for liquid milk samples and 95.5% for lyophilized powder milk samples. However, when using only five spectral lines related to the inorganic content of milk (Mg, Ca, Na, and K), the classification accuracies were slightly lower, reaching up to 87.6% for liquid milk samples and 92.9% for lyophilized powder milk samples.\n\nOverall, the machine learning"
