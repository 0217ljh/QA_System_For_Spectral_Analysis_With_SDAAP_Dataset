        "Output": "The metric chosen to compare the prediction accuracy of models that explicitly deal with spatial information and use a spectral index as a covariate with machine learning regression models is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE can go up to 75% when the spatial dependency is coincident with the sampling distance."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral index-based models that explicitly deal with spatial information can be used to predict accurately in areas with significant spatial autocorrelation. These models take into account both the spectral and spatial dimensions of the data, which helps in capturing the spatial patterns and improving prediction accuracy.\n\nIn terms of prediction accuracy, these spectral index-based models generally outperform machine learning regression models. This is because the spectral index-based models incorporate spatial information, which helps in accounting for the spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals. By considering the spatial patterns, these models can better capture the underlying relationships between the predictors and the plant traits, leading to more accurate predictions."
