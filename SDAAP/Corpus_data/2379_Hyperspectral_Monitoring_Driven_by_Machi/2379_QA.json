        "Output": "The role of different spectral variables in above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation in the alpine meadow in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was analyzed in the study. Various feature selection algorithms were used to extract an optimal subset of spectral variables. The Lasso and RFE_SVM band filtering machine learning models were found to effectively select the global optimal feature and improve the prediction effect of the model. \n\nFurthermore, the analysis compared the support vector machine (SVM), least squares regression boosting (LSB), and Gaussian process regression (GPR) AGB inversion models. The results showed that the GPR machine learning model achieved the best outcomes among the three models.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that the accuracy of AGB inversion can be significantly improved by combining the spectral characteristics with the growing season. Different data combinations were analyzed, and it was observed that combining the spectral characteristics with the growing season improved the accuracy of AGB inversion.\n\nFinally, by constructing a machine learning interpretable model, it was discovered that the same band plays different roles in different records. This finding provides a scientific basis for the research of grassland resource monitoring and estimation in the alpine meadow in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau."
