        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the past study, machine learning classifiers were used to discriminate between cancer extracellular vesicles (EVs) and healthy controls by analyzing the vibrational spectra obtained from Raman spectroscopy measurements. The classifiers used were the AdaBoost Random Forest Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These classifiers were trained using a 50:50 split of the baseline corrected Raman spectra of EVs from cancer patients and healthy controls. The spectral frequency range used for classification was 1800 - 1940 cm^(-1). The classifiers were optimized using hyperparameter optimization techniques. The results showed that these machine learning algorithms were able to achieve a classification accuracy of over 90% in distinguishing cancer EVs from healthy controls. Additionally, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were performed as a complementary approach to Raman analysis on two of the four cancer subtypes, and the FTIR classification accuracy was found to be 80%. Overall, the past study demonstrated that basic machine learning algorithms can effectively differentiate the complex vibrational spectra of cancer patient EVs from those of healthy patients, suggesting the potential of these methods for artificial intelligence-assisted early cancer screening."

The study demonstrated that these spectroscopic techniques, when combined with machine learning algorithms, were able to distinguish the complex vibrational spectra of cancer patient extracellular vesicles (EVs) from those of healthy patients with high classification accuracy. Therefore, these non-invasive approaches have the potential to be superior to traditional methods for early cancer screening."
