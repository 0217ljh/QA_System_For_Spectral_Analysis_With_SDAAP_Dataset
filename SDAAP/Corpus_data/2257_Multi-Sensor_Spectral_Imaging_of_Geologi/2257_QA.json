This is achieved through the use of orthogonal total variation component analysis for image feature extraction. \n\nBy applying this technique, the extracted features capture the relevant spatial and spectral patterns in the data, while significantly reducing the dimensionality and memory size of each input dataset. This is particularly beneficial for sensors with high spatial and/or spectral resolution, as they typically require large amounts of memory for processing.\n\nThe reduction in dimensionality and memory size allows for more efficient and streamlined processing of the data, enabling rapid and reproducible drillcore logging. Additionally, it facilitates the fusion of data acquired from multiple sensors, which is typically challenging due to the differences in spatial and spectral resolution.\n\nOverall, the proposed workflow provides a versatile solution for integrating multi-source hyperspectral data in drillcore mapping, improving efficiency and accuracy in mineral exploration."
