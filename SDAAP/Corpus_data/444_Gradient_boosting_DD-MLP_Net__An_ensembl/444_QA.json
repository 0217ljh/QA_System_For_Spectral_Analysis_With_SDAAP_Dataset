        "Output": "The metric chosen in the study to assess the after-stroke dyskinesias degree was the accuracy of classification. The study reported high accuracy rates for both upper limb dyskinesias (98.91% under passive mode and 98.69% under active mode) and lower limb dyskinesias (99.45% under passive mode and 99.63% under active mode). Therefore, the chosen metric of accuracy demonstrated a high level of success in classifying and evaluating the dyskinesias degree in after-stroke patients."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The Gradient Boosting DD-MLP Net model was used in the past study to evaluate the degree of after-stroke dyskinesias. It was developed by combining the dendrite network and multilayer perceptron. The model utilized feature information fusion using the D-S evidence theory. The muscular hemodynamic responses from the bilateral femoris (biceps brachii) muscles were recorded using NIRS during passive and active upper (lower) limb circular exercise. The model achieved high accuracy in classifying upper limb dyskinesias, with 98.91% accuracy under the passive mode and 98.69% accuracy under the active mode. Similarly, it achieved high accuracy in classifying lower limb dyskinesias, with 99.45% accuracy under the passive mode and 99.63% accuracy under the active mode. The model, combined with NIRS, has the potential to effectively monitor after-stroke dyskinesias degree and guide rehabilitation training."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of machine learning and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in assessing after-stroke dyskinesias degree has shown promising results compared to traditional methods. Traditional methods typically rely on subjective assessments by healthcare professionals, which can be prone to human error and variability. \n\nIn contrast, the use of machine learning algorithms allows for objective and automated assessment of dyskinesias degree. By analyzing the muscular hemodynamic responses recorded by NIRS during passive and active upper and lower limb exercises, the machine learning model can accurately classify the degree of dyskinesias.\n\nThe past study achieved high accuracy rates of 98.91% and 98.69% for classifying upper limb dyskinesias under passive and active modes, respectively. For lower limb dyskinesias, the accuracy rates were even higher at 99.45% and 99.63% under passive and active modes, respectively.\n\nThese results suggest that the combination of machine learning and NIRS has the potential to outperform traditional methods in assessing after-stroke dyskinesias degree. It offers a more objective and reliable approach, which can be valuable in monitoring patients' progress and guiding rehabilitation training."
