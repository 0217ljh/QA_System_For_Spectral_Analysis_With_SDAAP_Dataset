        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the classifiers in this study was the kappa statistic, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. These metrics were used in the assembly of the voting methods. \n\nThe kappa statistic is a measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the agreement that could occur by chance. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement and values close to 0 indicate agreement no better than chance.\n\nThe F1-score is a measure of the classifier's accuracy, taking into account both precision and recall. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect accuracy.\n\nThe Matthews correlation coefficient is a measure of the quality of binary classifications, taking into account true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect classification and -1 indicates total disagreement.\n\nThese metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the classifiers' performance in terms of accuracy, agreement, and quality of classification."
