        "Output": "The study investigated the effects of oil metal pollution on diesel engine conditions by using large datasets and machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) models. The researchers collected 1948 datasets from engine lubricant spectral analysis. They then trained the SVM and RBF models using different kernel functions and training methods. The accuracy of the models in forecasting engine conditions was evaluated, with RBF achieving the highest accuracy of 99 percent and SVM achieving 97 percent. The researchers also tested the models' ability to generalize by varying the dataset size. RBF demonstrated the greatest performance in this regard. Additionally, the RBF-NN classifier was used to diagnose the engine's critical state with a 99.38 percent accuracy using the confusion matrix approach. The study found that metal contaminations such as Cr, Si, and Fe had a significant impact on the accuracy of engine identification. Based on the results, RBF-NN was chosen as the preferred model for defining and monitoring diesel engine conditions due to its superior performance compared to the SVM model."

        "Output": "The study investigated the effects of oil metal pollution on diesel engine conditions by using large datasets and machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN) classifiers. A total of 1948 datasets from engine lubricant spectral analysis were utilized in the study.\n\nThe researchers found that the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy for forecasting engine conditions when using the cubic Polynomial (poly 3) and RBF kernel functions. The RBF-NN classifiers, on the other hand, employed two training methods: trainbr and trainlm. Both the RBF and SVM classifiers had high average accuracies of 99 percent and 97 percent, respectively, for engine condition predictions.\n\nTo test the models' ability to generalize, the dataset size was varied from 10% to 90%, with the RBF classifier demonstrating the best performance. Additionally, the RBF-NN classifier used the confusion matrix approach to diagnose the engine's critical state with a remarkable accuracy of 99.38 percent.\n\nThe presence of metal contaminations such as Cr, Si, and Fe was found to have a significant impact on the accuracy of engine identification in normal, critical, and numerous classes, as determined by the RBF-NN sensitivity study."
