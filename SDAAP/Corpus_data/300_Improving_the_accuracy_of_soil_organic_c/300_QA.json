        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the calibration methods is a combination of three criteria: the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and residual prediction deviation (RPD). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy and precision of the calibration models."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The combination of support vector machine regression (SVMR) with Savitzky-Golay smoothing with the first derivatives of reflectance (FDR) preprocessing can be considered as a superior spectroscopic method for determining soil organic carbon (SOC) content compared to traditional methods. The past study compared the performance levels of partial least-squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine regression (SVMR), and wavelet neural network (WNN) calibration methods coupled with different preprocessing approaches. The results indicated that the SVMR model with FDR provided the best prediction results for SOC content, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.92, residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 2.82, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.36%, and a high kappa correlation coefficient of interpolation of 0.97. Therefore, the combination of SVMR with FDR preprocessing is recommended over traditional methods such as PLSR and WNN for the high-accuracy determination of SOC content."
