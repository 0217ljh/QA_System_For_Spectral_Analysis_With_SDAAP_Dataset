The study primarily focused on using very high-resolution WorldView-3 satellite imagery and machine learning techniques, specifically an extreme gradient boosting classifier, to detect the probability of gamba grass presence.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it cannot be concluded whether spectroscopic methods are superior or not to traditional methods in accurately mapping the distribution of gamba grass using machine learning and satellite imagery."
