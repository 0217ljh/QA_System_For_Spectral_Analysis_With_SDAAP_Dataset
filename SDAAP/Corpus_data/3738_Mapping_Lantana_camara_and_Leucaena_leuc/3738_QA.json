        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the use of PlanetScope and Sentinel datasets, along with machine learning algorithms, for mapping the distribution of native and invasive species in two protected areas in Pakistan by analyzing the multispectral data with four machine learning algorithms (classifiers) - random forest (RF), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM). They compared the accuracy of these algorithms in detecting two invasive species, Lantana camara L. (common lantana) and Leucaena leucocephala L. (Ipil-ipil), using both PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel (10 m) imagery. The researchers found that RF, GMM, and SVM algorithms were more accurate at detecting both invasive species when using PlanetScope imagery compared to Sentinel. Random forest produced the highest accuracy of 64% using PlanetScope data. They also noted that it was not possible to discriminate the native species Dodonea viscosa Jacq. (Snatha) using the SVM classifier for Sentinel data. Overall, the accuracy of PlanetScope was slightly better than Sentinel in terms of species discrimination."
