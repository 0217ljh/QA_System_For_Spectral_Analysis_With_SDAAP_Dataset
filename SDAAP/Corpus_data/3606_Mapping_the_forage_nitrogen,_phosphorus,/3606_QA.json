        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the estimation models in the related study is the coefficient of determination (R-2 value). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (forage N, P, and K contents) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral bands of the sensors). \n\nThe R-2 values obtained in this study for forage N, P, and K estimations range from 0.68 to 0.76, 0.54 to 0.73, and 0.74 to 0.82, respectively. These values indicate that the estimation models using the spectral bands of the Sentinel-2 MSI and Tiangong-2 MWI sensors have a good performance in predicting the forage nutrient contents.\n\nThe high R-2 values suggest that the estimation models based on these sensors can accurately map the forage N, P, and K contents at the regional scale."

        "Output": "In the related study, machine learning models were utilized to develop forage N, P, and K estimation models. These models were developed using data collected at 92 sample sites ranging from the vigorous growth stage to the senescent stage. Multiple feature selection algorithms were applied to the Sentinel-2 MSI and Tiangong-2 MWI data, which are equipped with several spectral bands suitable for specific applications. The machine learning models were trained using these selected features to estimate the forage N, P, and K contents in alpine grasslands at the regional scale. The performance of the models was evaluated using the R-2 values, which ranged from 0.68 to 0.76 for forage N estimations, 0.54 to 0.73 for forage P estimations, and 0.74 to 0.82 for forage K estimations. The results showed that the spectral bands of both the Sentinel-2 MSI and Tiangong-2 MWI had excellent performance in estimating the forage nutrient contents. Additionally, the model that integrated the spectral bands of these two sensors explained 78%, 74%, and 84% of the variations in the forage N, P, and K contents, respectively."

The study found that the spectral bands of both sensors have excellent performance in estimating the forage nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents, with R-2 values ranging from 0.68 to 0.82. \n\nFurthermore, the model that integrates the spectral bands of these two sensors explains a significant portion of the variations in forage N, P, and K contents, accounting for 78%, 74%, and 84% of the variations, respectively. This indicates that the estimation ability of forage nutrients can be further improved by integrating Tiangong-2 MWI and Sentinel-2 MSI data.\n\nOverall, the integration of spectral bands from these two sensors offers a promising approach to accurately map forage N, P, and K contents in alpine grasslands at the regional scale. This study provides valuable information for growth monitoring and real-time determination of forage quality in alpine grasslands."
