These metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the different machine learning algorithms and extraction strategies in predicting the texture parameters of Tan mutton. The study found that the LSSVM-iVISSA-CARS models had an RMSEP of 5.259 and 3.051, and an R-p(2) of 0.986 and 0.984 for hardness and gumminess respectively. The LSSVM-iVISSA-SPA model achieved an R-p(2) of 0.987 and an RMSEP of 4.970 for chewiness. These metrics indicate the accuracy and reliability of the models in predicting the texture parameters of Tan mutton using HSI."

Random Forest (RF): RF was developed as a machine learning algorithm to establish a spectral model for determining the texture parameters of Tan mutton.\n\n4. Decision Trees (DT): DT was utilized as a machine learning algorithm to establish a spectral model based on the characteristic bands selected by different extraction strategies.\n\nThese algorithms were used to analyze the hyperspectral images collected in the 900-1700 nm spectral range and establish correction models for the texture parameters of Tan mutton. Different extraction strategies, such as iVISSA, CARS, SPA, and VCPA, were employed to select characteristic bands for each algorithm."
