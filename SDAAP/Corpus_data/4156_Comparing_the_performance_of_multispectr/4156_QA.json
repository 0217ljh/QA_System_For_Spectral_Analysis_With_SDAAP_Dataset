        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of multispectral optical vegetation indices (VIs) and machine-learning algorithms (MLAs) in estimating chlorophyll content in the Sundarbans mangrove forest was investigated in this study. The study compared the performance of 15 multispectral VIs and six state-of-the-art MLAs with traditional methods.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the weight optimization and term selection used within the Genetic Algorithm (GA) MLA produced the most reliable chlorophyll content estimation. However, it was also found that the green normalized difference VI (GNDVI), which is a simple and computationally efficient VI, produced results that were nearly as accurate as GA in terms of model fit and performance.\n\nFurthermore, the study revealed that all methods, except for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), produced a quasi-linear relationship between spectral reflectance and chlorophyll content. This suggests that these methods can be effective in estimating chlorophyll content in the Sundarbans mangrove forest.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that statistical transformations of GNDVI and chlorophyll content have the capability of further reducing model error. This indicates that incorporating statistical transformations can improve the accuracy of chlorophyll content estimation using VIs and MLAs."
