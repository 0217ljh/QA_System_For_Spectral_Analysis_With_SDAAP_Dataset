        "Output": "The proposed intelligent AI-based system overcomes the expensive and error-prone nature of physical classification of ripe fruits in the agriculture industry by utilizing spectrophotometry and computer vision technologies. \n\nFirstly, the system uses spectrophotometry to analyze the spectral values of the fruits. This allows for a more accurate and objective measurement of the fruit's characteristics, such as color, ripeness, and quality. By using spectrophotometry, the system eliminates the need for manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error.\n\nSecondly, computer vision is employed to identify and segregate the fruits based on their grade. The system is trained to recognize different fruit types and grades through machine learning algorithms. This automated process ensures consistent and reliable results, reducing the chances of errors that may occur during manual classification.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed system utilizes a cloud-computing platform provided by Microsoft Azure, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the classification process. By leveraging cloud computing, the system can handle large amounts of data and perform complex calculations, leading to more precise fruit identification.\n\nOverall, the combination of spectrophotometry, computer vision, and cloud computing in the intelligent AI-based system significantly reduces the cost and potential errors associated with physical classification of ripe fruits in the agriculture"
