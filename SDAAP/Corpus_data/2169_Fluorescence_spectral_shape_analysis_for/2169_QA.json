        "input": "",
        "Output": "The text does not explicitly mention the specific metric that was chosen for classification accuracy. However, it does state that the normalized intensity of 3 to 5 selected wavelengths was sufficient for the fluorescence biosensor to classify 13 distinct nucleotides and distinguish single base substitutions with nearly 100% classification accuracy. Therefore, the chosen metric seems to be the normalized intensity of selected wavelengths, and it can achieve a high classification accuracy of nearly 100%."
