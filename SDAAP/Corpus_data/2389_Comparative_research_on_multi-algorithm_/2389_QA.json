        "Output": "In the related study, the applicability of GF-5, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data in soil salinity research was compared. The research results indicated that the correlation between Sentinel-2 and electric conductivity (EC) was higher than GF-5 and Sentinel-1. The simulation accuracy of models based on Sentinel-2 was slightly higher than that based on GF-5 and Sentinel-1. The three models' mean values of root mean square error (RMSE), R-2, and mean absolute error (MAE) of Sentinel-2 were slightly better than those of GF-5 and Sentinel-1. Therefore, it can be concluded that Sentinel-2 had better applicability in soil salinity research compared to GF-5 and Sentinel-1."

The three models' mean values of root mean square error (RMSE), R-2, and mean absolute error (MAE) of Sentinel-2 were slightly better than those of GF-5 and Sentinel-1. This suggests that Sentinel-2, with its high spectral resolution, performed better in predicting soil salinity compared to GF-5 and Sentinel-1."
