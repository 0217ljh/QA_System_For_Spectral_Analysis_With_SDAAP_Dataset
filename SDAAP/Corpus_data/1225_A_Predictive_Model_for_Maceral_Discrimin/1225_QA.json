        "Output": "In the research, a multivariate statistical analysis was conducted on the identified vitrinite and inertinite spectra. This analysis allowed for the definition of the variability of the organofacies and the development of a predictive PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) model for the identification of vitrinite from Raman spectra. The specific metric used to measure the performance of the model in identifying vitrinite from Raman spectra is not mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how far this metric can go in identifying vitrinite from Raman spectra based on the given information."
