        "Output": "The metric chosen to predict cassava root yield using the extracted vegetation indices/canopy metrics was the R-squared value. The accuracy of the prediction models varied depending on the machine learning algorithm used. Among the four ML algorithms tested (k-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine), the highest accuracy was achieved with k-Nearest Neighbours (R-2 = 0.67), followed by Random Forest (R-2 = 0.66) and Support Vector Machine (R-2 = 0.64)."

        "Output": "Yes, the developed CIAT Pheno-i image analysis framework and machine learning models using multispectral imagery obtained from UAVs can be applied to other crops for rapid extraction of phenotypic information. The study states that the CIAT Pheno-i framework was found to be easier and more rapid than manual methods, and the machine learning models showed good performance for root yield prediction. The conclusion also mentions that the image analysis software developed from the related study can be widely applicable to any other crop to extract phenotypic information rapidly. Therefore, the framework and models have the potential to be used as a selection tool in breeding programs for other crops as well."
