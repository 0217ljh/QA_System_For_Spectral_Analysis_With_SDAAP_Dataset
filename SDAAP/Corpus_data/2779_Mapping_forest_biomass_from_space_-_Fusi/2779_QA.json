        "input": "",
        "Output": "Combining data from different spaceborne sensors in the study improved the accuracy of biomass estimation. The study used interferometric (Tandem-X) and photogrammetric (WorldView-2) based predictors, such as canopy height models, along with hyperspectral predictors (EO1-Hyperion). By combining these different types of data, the researchers were able to create a more comprehensive and detailed picture of the forest ecosystem. This allowed for a more accurate estimation of forest biomass. The most accurate model (Random Forest) achieved a high r(2) value of 0.73 and a low RMSE of 14.9% (29.4 t/ha), indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual biomass values. Therefore, the fusion of canopy height and spectral information from different spaceborne sensors contributed to the improved accuracy of biomass estimation in the study."
