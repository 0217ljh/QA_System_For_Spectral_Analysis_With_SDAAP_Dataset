The ELM is a machine learning algorithm that can efficiently handle large-scale datasets and provide accurate classification results.\n4. To optimize the performance of the ELM, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the parameters of the ELM. This optimization process helps to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the coal identification model.\n5. Experimental results demonstrate that the RS_PSOTELM model achieves a high accuracy of 98.3% on the coal identification task. This model enables quick and accurate identification of coal, providing a low-cost, efficient, and reliable approach for coal identification during the mining and application phases.
