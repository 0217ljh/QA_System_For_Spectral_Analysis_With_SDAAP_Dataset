        "Output": "The RCRWa-b variable was found to be effective in estimating the chlorophyll content of rice using in situ hyperspectral remote sensing data and machine learning techniques. It was compared to other spectral feature processing methods, and four features of RCRWa-b, RCRW551.0-565.6, RCRW739.5-743.5, RCRW684.4-687.1, and RCRW667.9-672.0, were identified as effective in estimating the chlorophyll content of rice. The RFR model, which utilized the RCRWa-b variable, generated the highest prediction accuracy with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.54 and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.95 in the training set, and an RMSE of 2.64 and an R-2 of 0.80 in the validation set. Therefore, the RCRWa-b variable performed well compared to other spectral feature processing methods in estimating the chlorophyll content of rice."
