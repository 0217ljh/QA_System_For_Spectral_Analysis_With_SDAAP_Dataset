        "Output": "Other machine learning algorithms considered were OBRA and KNN. They were not chosen to evaluate the potential of using various platforms, sensors, and depth retrieval methods for mapping water depths in a 1.6-km reach of the upper Sacramento River, CA because their generality of depth-reflectance relations needed to be carefully assessed and further tested for accuracy at larger scales."
