        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of clustering methods in the automated mineral identification system using LWIR ground-based spectroscopy is higher compared to supervised classification using ELM. The clustering methods yield an identification accuracy of 84.91% using Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and 69.9% using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). On the other hand, the supervised classification using ELM achieves a classification accuracy of up to 76.69% for pyrope mixture and 70.95% for olivine mixture. Therefore, the clustering methods outperform the supervised classification in terms of accuracy in this particular system."
