        "Output": "The deep-learning algorithm from the discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine contributed to improving the application of remote-sensing technology for investigating and monitoring mountain rhododendron germplasm by using spectral data from different rhododendron species to obtain optimal parameters for the model. This algorithm was able to recognize and extract particular features of the plant species by analyzing the original spectra, noise smoothed spectra, and the first- and second-order spectral derivatives. The algorithm achieved high accuracies in recognizing these spectral information, with the first-order derivative giving the most accurate classification. Additionally, the algorithm significantly reduced the sample training time when analyzing changes in the second-order derivative. Overall, the algorithm proved effective in recognizing spectral information for different rhododendron species, which can further support the use of hyperspectral remote-sensing imagery for investigating and monitoring germplasm, species classification, and physiological parameter inversions for rhododendrons in various mountain regions of China."

The study mentioned in the text used field spectrometry to acquire spectral data from different rhododendron species and applied a deep-learning algorithm from a discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine to obtain optimal parameters for the model. The results showed that the discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine was effective in recognizing spectral information for different rhododendron species. This research suggests that the use of hyperspectral remote-sensing imagery, combined with the discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine, can be a valuable tool for investigating and monitoring rhododendron germplasm in mountain regions."
