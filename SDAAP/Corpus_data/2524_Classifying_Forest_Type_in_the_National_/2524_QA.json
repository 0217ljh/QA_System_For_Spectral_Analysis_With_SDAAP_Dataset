        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to map FIA-defined forest type in interior Alaska was forest type. Forest type is a classification system used to categorize different types of forests based on their structure, composition, and dominant tree species. In the context of the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, forest type is an important metric measured to assess and manage forest resources.\n\nThe study developed a methodology using airborne hyperspectral and lidar data to map FIA-defined forest types in interior Alaska. The goal was to determine the best classification algorithm and remote sensing data for accurately mapping forest types in sparsely sampled areas.\n\nThe chosen metric of forest type can go a long way in supporting ecological analysis and forest management decisions. It provides valuable information about the composition and structure of forests, which in turn regulates a range of ecosystem services such as biodiversity, water and nutrient cycling, and wood volume for resource extraction.\n\nBy accurately mapping forest types, this metric can help quantify carbon and other forest resources within specific domains, support management decisions related to disease and pests, and contribute to overall understanding and conservation of forest ecosystems."
