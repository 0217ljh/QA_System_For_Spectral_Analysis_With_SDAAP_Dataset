It plays a crucial role in identifying and locating the eggs in the thermal images. By utilizing the fast-RCNN algorithm, the system can accurately detect the eggs and distinguish them from the background. This detection is essential for further analysis and monitoring of the changes in the size of the egg air-cell during the hatching process. The algorithm helps in segmenting the eggs from the thermal images, enabling the subsequent analysis and calculation of the egg air-cell's size. Overall, the fast-RCNN algorithm contributes to the accurate and efficient detection of the eggs, which is a fundamental step in monitoring the hatching process and tracking the changes in the size of the egg air-cell."
