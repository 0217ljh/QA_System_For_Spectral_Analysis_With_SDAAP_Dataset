        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study to detect crop nitrogen deficit in a soilless tomato crop is reflectance measurements. The related study found that crop reflectance increased in specific wavelength bands (775 nm-850 nm and 910 nm-960 nm) due to nitrogen deficiency. Based on these reflectance measurements, several reflectance indices were calculated and correlated with the tomato leaf chlorophyll or nitrogen content and with the leaf photosynthesis rate. The results showed that certain reflectance indices, such as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), the transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (TCARI), the optimised soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), and the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), varied significantly with changes in nitrogen concentration. Additionally, a new spectral index called the background adjustment nitrogen index (BANI) was developed and validated for the estimation of tomato plant nitrogen concentration. Therefore, the reflectance measurements and associated reflectance indices serve as a reliable metric for detecting crop nitrogen deficit in a soilless tomato crop."
