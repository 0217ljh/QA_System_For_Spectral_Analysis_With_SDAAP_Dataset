Low-level fusion: This technique involved the direct combination of the pXRF and vis-NIR spectra.\n\n2. Middle-level fusion: This technique involved the combination of selected bands of the pXRF and vis-NIR spectra using the Boruta feature selection algorithm.\n\n3. High-level fusion: This technique involved two methods - outer-product analysis (OPA) and Granger-Ramanathan averaging (GRA) - to combine the pXRF and vis-NIR spectra."

        "Output": "In the related study, the portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and visible near-infrared reflectance (vis-NIR) sensors were found to be effective in measuring the eight potentially toxic elements in soil. The study used different fusion techniques to combine the data from these sensors and achieve accurate estimations.\n\nFor the elements Cu and Zn, the measurement using pXRF spectra alone showed high accuracy, with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) values of 0.96 and 0.98, and ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) values of 2.36 and 2.69, respectively.\n\nThe measurement of Ni had the highest model performance for high-level fusion GRA, with an LCCC of 0.89 and an RPIQ of 3.42. The measurements of Cr using middle- and high-level fusion were similar, with an LCCC of 0.86 and an RPIQ of 2.97.\n\nThe best estimation accuracy for As, Cd, and Pb was obtained by high-level fusion using OPA, with an LCCC greater than 0.72 and an RPIQ greater than 1.2.\n\nHowever, the measurement of Hg using these techniques"
