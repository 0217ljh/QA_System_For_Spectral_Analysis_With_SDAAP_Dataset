        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in related study is the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, the correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between quality indices (Brix, titratable acidity, Brix: TA, and BrimA), sensory assessment of the fruit, and short-wave NIR spectra.\n\nThe correlation coefficient values obtained for the quality indices ranged from 0.55 to 0.73, indicating a moderate to strong correlation between the NIR spectra and the quality indices. This suggests that the NIR spectra can provide valuable information about the fruit's quality."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized in the evaluation of short-wave NIR spectroscopy and direct sweetness classification approach for Pakistani cultivars of orange by developing partial least squares regression models and an ensemble classifier. \n\nThe partial least squares regression models were developed to estimate the quality indices, such as Brix, titratable acidity (TA), Brix: TA, and BrimA, based on the short-wave NIR spectral data. These models had correlation coefficients of 0.57, 0.73, 0.66, and 0.55, respectively, on independent test data.\n\nThe ensemble classifier was used for direct fruit classification, classifying the oranges into three categories: sweet, mixed, and acidic. This classification was based on the short-wave NIR spectra. The ensemble classifier achieved an accuracy of 81.03% on independent test data for the three classes.\n\nTherefore, machine learning models were employed to train and develop models that could estimate the quality indices and classify the oranges based on their sweetness using the short-wave NIR spectroscopy data."
