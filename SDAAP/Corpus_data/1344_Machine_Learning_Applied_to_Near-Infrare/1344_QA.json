        "Output": "Yes, the combination of attribute and wavelength selection in near-infrared (NIR) spectral information can be considered superior to traditional methods for classifying poultry samples according to quality grades in the study on the assessment of chicken meat quality using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. The study found that using decision trees and decision table predictors with optimal wavelengths selected through attribute and wavelength selection resulted in a precision of 77.2% in classifying poultry samples according to quality grades. This indicates that the proposed methodology using the combination of attribute and wavelength selection is effective in accurately classifying poultry samples based on their quality grades."
