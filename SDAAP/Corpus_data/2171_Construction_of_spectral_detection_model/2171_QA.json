        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the SSC and pH detection models was the determination coefficient. The determination coefficient, also known as R-squared (R^2), measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (SSC or pH) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral data). \n\nThe text states that the determination coefficients of the calibration set and validation set were both above 0.9. This indicates that the models had a high level of accuracy in predicting the SSC and pH of the pear fruit. However, the text does not provide specific information on how far this metric can go beyond 0.9."

        "Output": "Yes, the non-imaging spectrometer data processing method used in the study can be considered reliable and effective for detecting soluble solids content (SSC) and acidity (pH) in pear fruit for fruit quality evaluation. The study compared the performance of the non-imaging spectrometer PSR + 3500 and the imaging spectrometer SOC710E in collecting spectral data of SSC and pH in 'Dangshan' pear fruit. The results showed that the data processing process of the non-imaging spectrometer performed better. The SSC and pH detection models, constructed using the characteristic bands screened by Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) and the Random Forest Regression (RFR) modeling method, had high accuracy with determination coefficients above 0.9 for both calibration and validation sets. These findings provide an important theoretical foundation for the development of real-time online fruit SSC and pH detection equipment."
