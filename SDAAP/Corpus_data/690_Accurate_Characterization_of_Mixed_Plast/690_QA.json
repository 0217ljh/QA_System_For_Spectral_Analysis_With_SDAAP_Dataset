The low signal-to-noise ratio of dark plastic materials makes their identification challenging, but the PlasticNet CNN architecture overcomes this challenge by utilizing convolutional neural networks.\n\nThe PlasticNet CNN architecture is specifically designed to work with fast MIR (mid-infrared spectroscopy) data. This allows for the collection of spectral data at a high rate of up to 400 Hz. The CNN model within the PlasticNet architecture is capable of reaching prediction speeds of 8200 Hz.\n\nBy combining the fast MIR system with the PlasticNet CNN architecture, the method enables real-time high-throughput characterization of mixed plastic waste. The CNN model can achieve an overall classification accuracy of 100% and can accurately identify the constituent materials in a multiplastic blend with 100% accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the PlasticNet CNN architecture contributes to the classification of different types of dark plastic materials in mixed plastic waste streams by providing a fast and accurate method for identification and classification, even in challenging low signal-to-noise ratio conditions."
