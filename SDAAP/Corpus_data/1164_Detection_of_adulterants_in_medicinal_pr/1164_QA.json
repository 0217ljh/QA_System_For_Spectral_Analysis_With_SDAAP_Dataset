The algorithm is motivated by the superiority of extreme learning machines (ELM) and aims to generate diversity for designing ensemble algorithms through the self-contained random operation of ELM. The fast learning speed of ELM makes the EWELM algorithm practical and valuable. By comparing the results of the EWELM algorithm with the reference algorithms (Partial least squares and the full-spectrum ELM), the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the EWELM algorithm in detecting synthetic drug adulterants in Chinese patent medicine."
