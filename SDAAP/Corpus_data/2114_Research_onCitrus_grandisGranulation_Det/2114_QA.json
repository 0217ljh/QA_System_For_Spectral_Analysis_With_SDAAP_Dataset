        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the detection model is the percentage accuracy. The study mentions that the conventional convolution neural network (CNN) achieved the best accuracy of 88.02% during training. After adding the batch-normalization layer to the CNN, the detection model obtained a 100% accuracy in the train set and 97.9% accuracy in the validation set. Therefore, the metric used in this study can achieve up to 100% accuracy in the train set and up to 97.9% accuracy in the validation set."

        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the proposed nondestructive granulation detecting method based on deep learning can be applied to other fruits or agricultural products. The study specifically focuses on citrus fruit granulation and the development of a detection model using hyperspectral imaging. Therefore, it is unclear whether this method can be directly applied to other fruits or agricultural products without further research and experimentation."
