        "Output": "The study found that GBM algorithms had higher accuracy than ML algorithms, and DL had better accuracy than GBM. The four DL models developed in the study achieved fine-grained sampling site recognition with 100% accuracy using small samples. A computer application system was also developed based on these models. The study concludes that spectral image processing combined with DL is a rapid and efficient classification method that can be widely used in food identification."

        "Output": "In the study, the concepts of 3DCOS, 3DCOS projected images, index images, and 2DCOS were combined with deep learning (DL) for classification. The researchers proposed a model called BoletusResnet, which utilized deep learning techniques. \n\nTo achieve classification, the researchers used spectral image processing techniques. They applied Fourier Transform Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-MIR) preprocessing using different methods such as 1st, 2nd, MSC, SNV, and SG. These preprocessing techniques were used to enhance the quality of the spectral data.\n\nIn addition to the traditional 2DCOS (two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy), the researchers introduced the concept of 3DCOS. This involved analyzing the correlation between three different variables in the spectral data. By considering the correlation between multiple variables, more comprehensive information about the samples could be obtained.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers introduced the concept of 3DCOS projected images and index images. These images were derived from the 3DCOS analysis and provided visual representations of the correlation patterns in the spectral data. These images served as additional features for the classification model.\n\nFinally, the researchers combined the spectral image processing techniques, including 2DCOS, 3DCOS, 3"
