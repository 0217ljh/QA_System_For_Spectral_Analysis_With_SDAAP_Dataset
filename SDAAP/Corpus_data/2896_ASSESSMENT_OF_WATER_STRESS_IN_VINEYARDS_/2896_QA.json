        "Output": "The metric chosen in classifying plant water stress in vineyards was plant water stress, measured as leaf water potential (Psi(L)). This metric was used to classify the level of water stress into three classes: no to mild water stress, moderate water stress, and severe water stress. The study aimed to evaluate the applicability of hyperspectral data in classifying plant water stress based on this metric."

        "Output": "Machine learning models, specifically the random forest classifier (RFC) and artificial neural network (ANN) models, were utilized to classify plant water stress in vineyards using hyperspectral data. The study analyzed hyperspectral images acquired from a ground-based utility vehicle to evaluate the applicability of hyperspectral data in classifying plant water stress. The models were trained using several vegetative indices (VIs) derived from hyperspectral reflectance information, such as the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), and Anthocyanin Index (ANT). \n\nLinear relationships between the VIs and leaf water potential (Psi(L)), which is a measure of plant water stress, were evaluated to select the optimal VIs for vine water stress classification. Additionally, other environmental factors such as air relative humidity, evapotranspiration, minimum soil temperature, and solar radiation were included in the models as they demonstrated high significance in model development.\n\nThe RFC model achieved an accuracy of 73%, while the ANN model achieved an accuracy of 70% in classifying plant water stress into three classes: no to mild water stress, moderate water stress, and severe water stress."

        "Output": "The study evaluated the applicability of hyperspectral data in classifying plant water stress in vineyards by analyzing hyperspectral images acquired from a ground-based utility vehicle. The images were used to classify plant water stress measured as leaf water potential (Psi(L)) into three classes: no to mild water stress, moderate water stress, and severe water stress. Several vegetative indices (VIs) derived from the hyperspectral reflectance information were assessed to estimate the level of water stress. The study selected the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), and Anthocyanin Index (ANT) as the optimal VIs based on their consistently good trends in the data obtained over two growing seasons.\n\nTo develop decision support tools for precision irrigation, the study included additional variables such as air relative humidity, evapotranspiration, minimum soil temperature, and solar radiation in the analysis. These variables demonstrated high significance in model development. The study used a random forest classifier (RFC) and an artificial neural network (ANN) to develop models for classifying plant water condition into three classes. The RFC model had an accuracy of 73%, while the ANN model had an accuracy of 70%."
