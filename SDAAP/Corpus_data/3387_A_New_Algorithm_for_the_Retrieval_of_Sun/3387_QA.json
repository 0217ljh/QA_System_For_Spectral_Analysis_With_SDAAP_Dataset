        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the algorithm is the relative error. The relative error measures the difference between the estimated SICF peak value obtained by the algorithm and the actual SICF peak value obtained by the remote sensor, expressed as a percentage of the actual value. \n\nThe algorithm was able to achieve relative errors lower than 2% for the SICF peak value in 81% of the samples. This represents a significant improvement compared to the classic FLH algorithm, which had relative errors higher than 40% in 59% of the samples. \n\nBased on this information, the metric of relative error provides a quantitative measure of the accuracy of the algorithm in retrieving the SICF emission. It allows for a comparison of the algorithm's performance with the previous method and indicates that the proposed algorithm is much more effective in accurately estimating the SICF peak value."

        "Output": "The machine learning regression algorithm (MLRA) was used in the development of the high spectral resolution retrieval algorithm for disentangling the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) emission from the water-leaving radiance in aquatic ecosystems by estimating the true reflectance. The MLRA was trained and validated using two large reflectance databases that represented a wide range of coastal and ocean water components and scattering conditions. The MLRA used a cubic spline fitting adjustment and empirical estimation from the normalized reflectance at three wavelengths to predict the true reflectance. Support vector regression was found to provide the best results, with relative errors lower than 2% for the SICF peak value in 81% of the samples. This improvement was significant compared to the classic fluorescence line height (FLH) algorithm, which had relative errors higher than 40% in 59% of the samples when applied for OLCI bands."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The new retrieval algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of retrieving SICF emission from water bodies compared to the traditional fluorescence line height (FLH) method. The proposed algorithm retrieves the reflectance without SICF contribution by extrapolating the reflectance from adjacent regions. It then obtains the SICF emission curve by calculating the difference between the reflectance with SICF (apparent reflectance) obtained by a remote sensor and the reflectance without SICF (true reflectance) estimated by the algorithm. \n\nThe algorithm utilizes a machine learning regression algorithm (MLRA) and a cubic spline fitting adjustment to estimate the true reflectance from the normalized reflectance at three wavelengths. It was trained and validated using two large reflectance databases representing a wide range of coastal and ocean water components and scattering conditions.\n\nThe results of the new retrieval algorithm showed relative errors lower than 2% for the SICF peak value in 81% of the samples. This is a significant improvement compared to the traditional FLH algorithm, which had relative errors higher than 40% in 59% of the samples when applied for OLCI bands. Therefore, the new retrieval algorithm outperforms the FLH method in accurately retrieving SICF emission from water bodies."
