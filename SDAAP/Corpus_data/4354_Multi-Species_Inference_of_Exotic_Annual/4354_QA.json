        "input": "",
        "Output": "Spectral information from five bands (Blue, Red, NIR, MIR, SWIR) was randomly extracted within five natural breaks clusters of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for each scene. Decision-tree classification models were calibrated for optimal hyperparameters and applied to make a binary map with cleaned and contaminated pixels for each scene."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of mapping exotic annual grass (EAG) species was the Median Absolute Error (MdAE) and the correlation coefficient (r). The study found that the MdAE values for EAG, cheatgrass, and medusahead were 3.22, 2.72, and 0.02, respectively. The correlation coefficients (r) for EAG, cheatgrass, and medusahead were 0.82, 0.81, and 0.73, respectively. These results indicate that the mapping of EAG species using the chosen metric performed relatively well, with low MdAE values and high correlation coefficients."

        "Output": "The enhanced version of the U.S. Geological Survey Rangeland Exotic Plant Monitoring System utilizes artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques to accurately map the abundance of exotic annual and perennial grass species in the rangelands of the western United States by incorporating field observations and remote-sensing data. \n\nThe system employs a fully automated and multi-task deep-learning framework that predicts and generates weekly, near-seamless composites of Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 spectral data. This deep-learning framework leverages the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Wetness Index time-series data to enable near real-time and accurate mapping of exotic annual grass (EAG), cheatgrass, and medusahead abundances.\n\nTo achieve this, the system utilizes an ensemble of independent XGBoost models, which are trained using the deep-learning framework's outputs, auxiliary datasets, and time series metrics. These models are capable of quantifying the abundance and phenology of annual and perennial grass species at a 30-meter spatial resolution.\n\nThe accuracy of the mapping is demonstrated by the Median Absolute Error (MdAE) and correlation coefficient (r) values obtained for EAG, cheatgrass, medusahead, and native perennial grass species."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the developed monitoring system can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of providing timely and accurate data for conservation and management efforts. The system utilizes a combination of field observations, remote-sensing data, and artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques to rapidly produce maps of species abundances at a 30-m spatial resolution. This allows for near real-time monitoring and accurate mapping of exotic annual and perennial grass species, including the invasive EAG species such as cheatgrass and medusahead. The system incorporates time-series data and metrics, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, generated from a deep-learning framework, enabling accurate and timely mapping of these species. The accuracy of the system is demonstrated by the low Median Absolute Error (MdAE) values and high correlation coefficients (r) obtained for EAG, cheatgrass, medusahead, and native perennial grass abundance. The resulting data from this monitoring system provide valuable insights into rangeland grass dynamics, which can be used for various applications such as fire and drought monitoring, habitat suitability mapping, and land-cover and land-change modeling."
