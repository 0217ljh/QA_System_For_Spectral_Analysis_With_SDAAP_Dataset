        "Output": "The text does not explicitly mention the specific metric that was chosen to assess the accuracy of the regression algorithms. However, it does mention the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) as a measure of accuracy. The RMSEP values are used to compare the performance of the partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machine (SVM) regression models. The text states that the SVM-RBF models showed a significant improvement in accuracy compared to PLS, resulting in a reduction of -14-29% on the RMSEP for sand and clay determinations, and a reduction of -8-22% on the RMSEP for soil organic matter (SOM) determinations. Therefore, the RMSEP is used as a metric to assess the accuracy of the regression algorithms in this study."

This resulted in a reduction of -14-29% on the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values.\n\nFor SOM determinations, the difference in RMSEP values between SVM-RBF and PLS became significant when 2000 or more samples were used in the calibration set. In this case, SVM-RBF showed a reduction of -8-22% on the RMSEP values compared to PLS.\n\nIt is worth noting that for all soil attributes investigated, between 20 and 27% of the external validation set (1173-2241 samples) were considered outliers and excluded by the PLS regression models. This suggests that the correlation between the vis-NIR spectra and clay, sand, and SOM contents becomes more complex as the variability/number of samples increases.
