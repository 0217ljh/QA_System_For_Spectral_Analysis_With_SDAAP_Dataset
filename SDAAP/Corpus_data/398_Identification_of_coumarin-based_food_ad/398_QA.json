        "input": "",
        "Output": "The P-t-SNE-DEGWO-SVM model proposed in the past study is more time-saving and efficient compared to traditional detection methods for identifying coumarin-based food additives using terahertz spectroscopy. The past study states that the prediction set accuracy of the P-t-SNE-DEGWO-SVM model is 98.61%, which is higher than the accuracy achieved by traditional methods. This indicates that the P-t-SNE-DEGWO-SVM model is more effective in accurately identifying coumarin-based food additives.\n\nAdditionally, the past study mentions that the P-t-SNE-DEGWO-SVM model outperforms other models, such as PCA-DEGWO-SVM and P-t-SNE-GWO-SVM, in terms of accuracy. This suggests that the P-t-SNE-DEGWO-SVM model is more reliable and efficient in identifying coumarin-based food additives.\n\nOverall, the P-t-SNE-DEGWO-SVM model offers improved time-saving and efficiency compared to traditional detection methods, making it a valuable approach for rapid and on-site identification of various food additives, including coumarin-based additives."
