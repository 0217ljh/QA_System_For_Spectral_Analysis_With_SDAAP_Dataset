The method uses 30 m annual mosaics derived from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images for different time periods. Spectral bands, spectral indices, and fraction images are used as input features for the machine learning algorithm. These features help in reducing the volume of data to be analyzed and highlighting the characteristics of forest plantations. The method allows for the classification of forest plantation areas into different classes, such as eucalypt and pine. The results of the classification are compared with land use and land cover maps to assess the accuracy of the method. The proposed method not only provides information on the extent of forest plantations but also helps in monitoring the phenological stages of eucalypt and pine plantations, showing the rotation cycle of these plantations. Overall, the method utilizes machine learning algorithms to automate the mapping of forest plantations on a regional and global scale, which can be valuable for planning and managing planted forests by commercial companies."
