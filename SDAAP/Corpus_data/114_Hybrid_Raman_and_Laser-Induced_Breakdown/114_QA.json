        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. the integration of Raman and LIBS modalities in a portable system can be considered superior to traditional methods for product classification and authentication. Past study demonstrated that the hybrid Raman/LIBS system achieved higher accuracy in product classification compared to the individual modalities. The accuracy of classification improved by approximately 10% when utilizing the hybrid Raman/LIBS spectra. This indicates that the integrated system provides more effective and reliable product authentication. Additionally, the hybrid system maintains the portability of the combined system, making it a practical solution for various industries. Therefore, the demonstrated benefits of the hybrid Raman/LIBS system support its superiority over traditional methods for product classification and authentication."
