        "Output": "The metric chosen in this study was the accuracy of the classification model based on the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The model was used to grade the samples of Andrographis paniculata into three classes: good, medium, and poor. The tenfold classification results of the model achieved an accuracy of 83% using standard normal variate (SNV) preprocessing.\n\nThe accuracy metric measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total samples. In this case, it indicates how well the model was able to accurately grade the plant samples based on their quality. An accuracy of 83% suggests that the model performed reasonably well in distinguishing between the different quality classes."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the past study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIR) shows potential as a method for estimating the gradation of Andrographis paniculata plant material and assessing the quality of the samples. The past study suggests that NIR can be used to estimate the major group active molecules, the andrographolides, in dried leaf samples and leaf methanol extracts of Andrographis paniculata. The calibration model developed using NIR spectra obtained from methanol extracts showed promise in grading the plant samples from different sources. The model, based on a machine learning algorithm called support vector machine (SVM), achieved an accuracy of 83% in classifying the samples into three classes: good, medium, and poor."
