        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers used a machine learning model called extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis in conjunction with fluorescence spectroscopy to classify red wines based on variety and geographical origin. They collected absorbance-transmission and fluorescence excitation emission matrix (ATEEM) data from the wines and performed multi-block data analysis using the A-TEEM data. The machine learning model was trained on this data to learn the patterns and characteristics associated with different wine varieties and regions of origin. The model was then used to predict the class assignment of new wine samples based on their A-TEEM data. The results showed that the machine learning model achieved a correct class assignment rate of 100% for variety and 99.7% for region of origin, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach for wine classification."
