        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers ranked the importance of input features in the semi-automated classification scheme for mapping sago palm using a method called recursive feature elimination. This method involves systematically removing features from the dataset and evaluating the impact on classification accuracy. By iteratively eliminating features and measuring the resulting accuracy, the researchers were able to determine the importance of each feature in distinguishing sago palm from other similar tree species."
