        "Output": "The firefly algorithm (FA) is used to optimize the regularization coefficient C and Gaussian kernel sigma for the kernel extreme learning machine (ELM) in the proposed urban land cover classification framework. FA is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies. In this context, FA is applied to find the optimal values of C and sigma that result in the best performance of the ELM classifier.\n\nThe optimization process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Initialization: The firefly algorithm starts by randomly initializing a population of fireflies, each representing a potential solution.\n\n2. Objective function evaluation: The performance of the ELM classifier is evaluated using the current values of C and sigma. This is done by training the ELM classifier on the training data and then testing it on the validation data.\n\n3. Firefly movement: Each firefly moves towards other fireflies in the population based on their attractiveness, which is determined by their objective function values. Fireflies with better objective function values are considered more attractive.\n\n4. Attraction calculation: The attractiveness between two fireflies is calculated based on their distance and their objective function values. Fireflies that are closer and have better objective function values are considered more attractive."
