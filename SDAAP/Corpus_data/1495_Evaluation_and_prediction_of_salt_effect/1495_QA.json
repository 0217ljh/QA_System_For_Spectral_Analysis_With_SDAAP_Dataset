The researchers applied label-free spectrometry techniques combined with machine learning algorithms. They used t-SNE analyses based on spectral measurements to identify differences between NaCl-free and salted treatments. Additionally, they exploited a variability seen in the emission spectra at specific wavelengths (300, 318, and 360 nm) to reflect structural or compositional changes. Using this information, predictive models were developed to accurately identify the five salted treatments and predict salt concentrations with high specificity and sensitivity."
