        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technologies in conjunction with deep learning can provide a more reliable and objective evaluation method for predicting the success of metallic coatings on carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) structured by nanosecond pulsed laser, compared to traditional methods. The study utilized HSI-based prediction models, which were able to accurately predict, with an accuracy of around 80%, which laser-treated areas will successfully be coated and which will not. This objective and automatic evaluation method allows for the avoidance of large amounts of rejects before further processing the parts and also helps optimize the adhesion of coatings. Additionally, the spatially resolved data obtained through HSI enables local reworking during the laser process, making it possible to achieve zero waste in the manufacturing process."
