This metric is used as an additional cross-validation criteria for the evaluation of classifier quality. However, the text does not specify how far this metric can go in the research."

        "Output": "The results of applying machine learning techniques to both the frequency and time domains of terahertz datasets in the research on automated pattern and waveform recognition of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy datasets showed that the random forest statistical algorithm performed well. It was observed that this algorithm worked well with the THz datasets in both the frequency and time domains. Using this algorithm, a classifier could be created with less than 1% out-of-bag error for segmentation of rusted and non-rusted sample regions of the image datasets in the frequency domain. The random forest algorithm was found to be the best choice among several popular ML techniques for waveform recognition of time-domain data in terms of classification accuracy and timing. These results demonstrate the usefulness of random forest and other machine learning algorithms for terahertz hyperspectral pattern recognition."
