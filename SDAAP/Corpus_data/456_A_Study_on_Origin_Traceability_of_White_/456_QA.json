The best performing models, DPC-CWT-LDA-KNN, DDFP-OS-LDA-KNN, and AFWT-OS-LDA-KNN, achieved recognition accuracies of 88.97%, 93.88%, and 97.96% respectively. Additionally, the area under curve (AUC) values for these models were 0.85, 0.93, and 0.98 respectively. These results indicate that NIRS combined with machine learning algorithms can be a reliable tool for determining the geographical origin of white tea."
