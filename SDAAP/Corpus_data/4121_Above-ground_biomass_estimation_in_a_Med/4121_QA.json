        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in estimating the above-ground biomass (AGB) was the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The MLPNN algorithm performed the best among the four machine learning algorithms, with an RMSE of 1.71 t ha-1. This indicates that, on average, the estimated AGB values deviated from the actual field-based AGB values by 1.71 t ha-1."
