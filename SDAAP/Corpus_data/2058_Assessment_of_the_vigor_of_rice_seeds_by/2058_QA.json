According to the text, the highest accuracy of vigor identification reached 99.5018% using the self-built model, which indicates a high level of accuracy in identifying seed vigor. Additionally, the near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology allows for quick and non-destructive identification of seed vigor, which is beneficial for obtaining the state of rice seeds without damaging them. This method also enables instant monitoring, which can contribute to the intelligent development of agriculture. Therefore, the combination of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology and deep learning algorithms offers a more efficient and accurate approach to identifying rice seed vigor compared to traditional methods."
