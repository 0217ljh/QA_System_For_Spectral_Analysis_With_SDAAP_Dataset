        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the related study, the combination of the ABF framework with the random forest (RF) model outperformed traditional methods in terms of algal bloom prediction accuracy. The related study states that the ABF framework equipped with the RF model achieved the best algal bloom predictions among the different evaluation metrics used, such as global accuracy, the kappa coefficient, F1-Score, and R-2-Score. Therefore, the combination of the ABF framework with the RF model demonstrated higher accuracy in predicting algal bloom events compared to traditional methods."
