        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the FPAR inversion model was the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the FPAR that can be explained by the inversion model, with a higher value indicating a better fit. The RMSE value represents the average difference between the predicted FPAR values and the actual FPAR values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the hybrid inversion model with artificial neural network (ANN-VIs) can be used to estimate FPAR for other crops besides canola. The study specifically focuses on estimating winter canola FPAR and does not mention the applicability of the model to other crops. Therefore, it is unclear whether the model can be directly applied to estimate FPAR for other crops without further evaluation and development."
