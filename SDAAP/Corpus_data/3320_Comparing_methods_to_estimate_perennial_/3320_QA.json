        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy and precision of biomass estimation in this study was the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted biomass values and the actual biomass values. \n\nThe related study states that the standard normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) had an RMSE of 115.1 kg DM ha(-1), while the best performing normalized ratio index had an RMSE equivalent to the NDVI.

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the findings of the related study, the spectral vegetation indices cannot be considered superior to the canopy-based technique in estimating pasture biomass. The study compared 97 vegetation indices and 11,026 combinations of normalized ratio indices with different regression techniques. It was found that the canopy-based technique was superior to the standard normalized difference vegetation index and equivalent to the best performing normalized ratio index. Additionally, four selected vegetation indices deployed with different regression techniques were found to be more accurate than the canopy-based technique. Therefore, the study suggests that the canopy-based technique is superior to the spectral vegetation indices in estimating pasture biomass."
