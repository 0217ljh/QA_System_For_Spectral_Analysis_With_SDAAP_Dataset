        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the non-destructive analytical technique of attenuated total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) can be used to achieve the purpose of monitoring quality, traceability, and safety assessment of Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) and prevent food fraud. This technique, coupled with Machine Learning algorithms, can analyze the EVOO data set from different regions to verify geographical traceability, cultivar, and the repeatability of agronomical practices. It can also detect adulterated EVOO from soy and corn. The use of ATR-FTIR in the related study eliminates the need for reagents or esterification processes and allows for analysis of the entire frequency range, reducing time and costs."
