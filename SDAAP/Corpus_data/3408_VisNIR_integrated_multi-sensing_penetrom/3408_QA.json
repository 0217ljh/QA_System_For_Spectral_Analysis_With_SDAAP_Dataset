        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the VisNIR multi-sensing penetrometer system, along with the use of external soil spectral libraries and the spectral correction algorithm EPO, can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of rapid, cost-effective, and high-resolution measurement of in situ soil properties. The system was tested in 11 agricultural fields and showed improved prediction accuracy for soil total carbon and total nitrogen compared to traditional methods. It also predicted soil bulk density with high accuracy. Therefore, this system offers a more efficient and cost-effective approach for measuring soil properties in situ."
