        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study to evaluate the performance of the different predictive models for estimating soil moisture (SM) is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the measured SM that can be explained by the modeled SM, with higher values indicating better model performance. The RMSE represents the average difference between the measured and modeled SM values, with lower values indicating better model accuracy."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of remote sensing data can improve the accuracy of soil moisture modeling compared to traditional interpolation methods in a semi-arid mountainous watershed. The related study states that the performance of remote sensing-based models, such as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), Inverse Distance Weighing (IDW), Ordinary kriging (OK), and Triangular regression (Tr), was higher than interpolation models for estimating soil moisture (SM). This is attributed to the influence of topographic parameters and surface biophysical characteristics that can be captured by remote sensing data. The results showed that RF produced the highest performance in SM modeling, while IDW produced the lowest performance. Therefore, the use of remote sensing data in combination with other environmental parameters can enhance the accuracy of soil moisture modeling in a semi-arid mountainous watershed."
