        "Output": "The DGPML model outperforms the conventional Gaussian process classifier in terms of training time and processing speed for classifying the THz spectra of 20 amino acids. The DGPML model requires 99% less training time and achieves 1530 times faster processing speed compared to the conventional Gaussian process classifier. Additionally, the DGPML model has around 0.29 million parameters, making it more efficient in terms of time and space complexity than neural-network models."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, the DGPML model has been proposed specifically for classifying an ensemble of 20 amino acids using THz spectroscopy. The model demonstrates a high prediction accuracy of 99.5% and is able to distinguish spectra without significant absorption peaks. It requires significantly less training time and achieves faster processing speed compared to conventional Gaussian process classifiers and neural-network models.\n\nHowever, the related study does not explicitly mention whether the DGPML model can be used to classify other biomolecules using THz spectroscopy with high prediction accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, it is not possible to determine if the DGPML model can be applied to classify other biomolecules."
