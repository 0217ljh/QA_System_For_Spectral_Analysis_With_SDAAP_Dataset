        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not possible to determine whether the random forest (RF) model can be considered a superior spectral feature processing method compared to traditional methods. The related study mentions that the RF model outperformed other machine learning methods in mapping SOC content in the QTP, but it does not provide a direct comparison to traditional methods of spectral feature processing. Therefore, further information is needed to make a comparison between the RF model and traditional methods."
