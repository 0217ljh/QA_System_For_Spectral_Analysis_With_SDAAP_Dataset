        "input": "",
        "Output": "The sensitivity analysis method for GPR predictive mean and variance functions aims to uncover knowledge in any kernel-based regression method by providing feature rankings and spectral spacings. \n\nFor the predictive mean function, the sensitivity analysis helps identify the relative relevance of input features. This allows researchers to understand which features have the most impact on the prediction and can help in identifying important variables or factors influencing the outcome.\n\nFor the predictive variance function, the sensitivity analysis helps determine the spectral spacings. This provides insights into the variability of the predictions and can help in understanding the uncertainty associated with the model's estimates.\n\nBy using this sensitivity analysis method, researchers can gain a better understanding of the underlying relationships between input features and predictions in kernel-based regression methods. This knowledge can be valuable in various applications, such as feature selection, model interpretation, and decision-making processes."
