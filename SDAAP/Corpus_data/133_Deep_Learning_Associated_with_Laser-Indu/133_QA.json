        "Output": "The proposed method using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was compared to traditional methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) in detecting soil contaminated with Pb (lead). The results showed that the method using LIBS with deep learning using a deep belief network (DBN) achieved satisfactory classification performance on all samples of contaminated soil. The robustness of the method was verified through the comparison with SVM and PLS-DA. The confusion matrix of the different algorithms indicated that the proposed method performed better on samples contaminated for four weeks compared to those contaminated for two weeks. Therefore, the proposed method using LIBS with deep learning showed promise in detecting heavy metals in soil, specifically Pb contamination."
