        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the detection performance of Xf infection was the kappa coefficient (kappa). The kappa coefficient measures the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the agreement that could occur by chance alone. \n\nIn terms of how far this metric can go in detecting Xf infection, the study found that the detection performance using support vector machine algorithms achieved approximately 80% accuracy (kappa = 0.42) when using the original full hyperspectral dataset including solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and the temperature-based Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). However, when the optimal set of six spectral bands most sensitive to Xf infection were used in addition to the CWSI thermal indicator, the detection performance decreased to approximately 74% accuracy (kappa = 0.36). \n\nWithout using SIF or CWSI, the detection performance yielded less than 70% accuracy (decreasing to very low performance, 0.29). This indicates that tree temperature, as indicated by the CWSI, was more important than chlorophyll fluorescence for the detection of Xf infection."

        "Output": "The contribution of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and the temperature-based Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) in the spectrally constrained machine-learning algorithms used for Xf detection in olive trees was evaluated. The study found that when SIF and CWSI were included in the algorithms, the detection performance decreased from approximately 80% accuracy (kappa = 0.42) to around 74% accuracy (kappa = 0.36). This suggests that SIF and CWSI have some importance in detecting Xf infection, but their contribution is not as significant as other factors. Additionally, when neither SIF nor CWSI were used, the detection accuracy dropped to less than 70% (decreasing x to very low performance, 0.29), indicating that tree temperature (CWSI) was more important than chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) for Xf detection in olive trees."

When the optimal set of six spectral bands most sensitive to Xf infection were used in addition to the CWSI thermal indicator, the detection performance decreased slightly to around 74% accuracy."
