        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the PSNet model is a combination of precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to accurately identify flooded areas in urban environments. The related study states that the PSNet model consistently achieves high precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy compared to other baseline classification models."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The limitations of traditional flood mapping methods that the researchers aimed for near real-time urban flood mapping  were:\n\n1) Nonhomogeneous background: Traditional flood mapping methods struggled to model the spatial relationship between sample pixels in the flooding area due to the presence of different types of objects such as buildings, moving vehicles, and road networks in high-resolution satellite imagery over urban areas.\n\n2) Handcrafted features: Conventional flood mapping models required handcrafted features associated with the data as input, which may not fully utilize the underlying patterns present in the large amount of available data.\n\n3) Inconsistent illumination conditions: High-resolution optical imagery often had varied pixel digital numbers (DNs) for the same ground objects due to highly inconsistent illumination conditions during a flood. This inconsistency posed challenges for traditional flood mapping methods in terms of generalization based on testing data."
