        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation models in the related study is the coefficient of determination (R-2), the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD), and the root mean square error (RMSE). These metrics provide a measure of how well the models are able to estimate the soil organic matter (SOM) content.\n\nThe R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit between the predicted and actual values of SOM. It represents the proportion of the variance in the SOM content that can be explained by the model.\n\nThe RPD is a measure of the ratio between the standard deviation of the reference values and the RMSE. It provides an indication of the reliability and precision of the model predictions. A higher RPD value indicates a more accurate estimation of SOM.\n\nThe RMSE represents the average difference between the predicted and actual values of SOM. A lower RMSE value indicates a smaller average error in the estimation.\n\nBased on the results of the study, the optimal hybrid model (SNV-PSO-CNN) achieved an R-2 value of 0.71, an RPD value of 1.88, and an RMSE value of 1.67 g kg(-1).

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The SNV (standard normal transform) spectral pre-processing method enhances the spectral information related to soil organic matter (SOM) and improves the accuracy of the estimation model for SOM content in desert soil using in situ spectroscopy. By applying the SNV method, the spectral data is normalized and transformed to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This normalization process helps to reduce the influence of external environmental factors, such as surface roughness of soil, changes in weather conditions, and atmospheric water vapor, which can interfere with the accuracy of in situ spectroscopy. \n\nThe SNV method effectively enhances the spectral information related to SOM by reducing the variability caused by these external factors. This improved spectral information allows for a more accurate estimation of SOM content in desert soil. The study found that the SNV method was one of the most effective spectral pre-treatment methods in improving the accuracy of the estimation model."
