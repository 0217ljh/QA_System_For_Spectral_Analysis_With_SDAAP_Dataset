        "input": "",
        "Output": "The spectral feature processing methods used to detect early indicators of water stress in container-grown ornamental shrub species included training models with individual R, G, or near-infrared channels to determine sensitivity to water stress and cropping a rectangle circumscribed to the plant to analyze if plant shape or other peripheral features aided the classifier."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the detection of water stress indicators in the related study was the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC is a common metric used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It measures the overall ability of the model to distinguish between different classes, in this case, the presence or absence of water stress indicators.\n\nThe study found that models trained on images of as few as eight water-stressed Buddleia plants achieved an average AUC of 0.9884 across four folds. This indicates that the models had a high degree of accuracy in detecting water stress indicators."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Cloud-based artificial intelligence was utilized in this research to detect early indicators of water stress in container-grown ornamental shrub species by training models through IBM Watson's Visual Recognition service. Near-infrared images of plants in different water stress conditions were collected using modified cameras deployed via a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS). These images were then split into cross-validation sets and used to train the models. Despite limitations such as a small sample size and low image resolution, the Watson-generated models were able to detect indicators of stress after a certain period of water deprivation. This approach demonstrated the potential of cloud-based artificial intelligence in identifying water stress in plants and assisting in optimizing water allocation in real-time."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of cloud-based artificial intelligence combined with spectral imaging can provide a superior method for detecting early indicators of water stress in container-grown ornamental shrub species compared to traditional methods. The study utilized near-infrared images collected with modified cameras deployed via a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) to detect water stress indicators. These images were then processed using IBM Watson's Visual Recognition service, which generated models capable of detecting indicators of stress after 48 hours of water deprivation with a significant to marginally significant degree of separation in four out of five species tested. Additionally, two models were able to detect indicators of water stress after only 24 hours, achieving high accuracy with minimal training data. This approach offers advantages such as ease of pre-processing, minimal training data requirements, and outsourced computation, making it an attractive tool for agriculture analytics. When brought to scale, this framework can drive responsive irrigation systems that monitor crop status in real-time and maximize sustainable water use."
