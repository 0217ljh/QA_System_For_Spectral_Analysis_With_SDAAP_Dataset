        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the RF model in predicting cotton yield was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (crop yield) that can be explained by the independent variables (agromet-spectral variables). \n\nThe R-2 values obtained for the RF model were 69%, 60%, and 39% for the months of September, December, and February, respectively. These values indicate the percentage of the variation in crop yield that can be attributed to the predictor variables used in the model."

        "Output": "In the related study, the predictor variables were analyzed for co-linearity using a machine learning based random forest (RF) algorithm. The long-term agromet-spectral variables derived from multi-sensor satellites were used along with actual crop yield data from 2001 to 2017. The RF algorithm integrated and processed a large number of inputs derived from different satellite modalities, unscaled and non-uniform ground-based information, and expert knowledge. The algorithm was able to identify and account for co-linearity among the predictor variables, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the model."
