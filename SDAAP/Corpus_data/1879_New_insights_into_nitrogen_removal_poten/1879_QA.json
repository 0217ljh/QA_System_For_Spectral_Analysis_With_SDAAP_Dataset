        "input": "",
        "Output": "Machine learning models were utilized in the analysis by combining spectroscopy, 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing, absolute gene quantification, and supervised integrated machine learning. The Random Forests Regression models were used to identify the most effective predicting factors for ammoxidation potential and denitrification potential. These models had good predictive performances for the potential of ammoxidation (R-2 = 0.71) and denitrification (R-2 = 0.61). The models utilized the content of hydroxyl and temperature as the predicting factors for ammoxidation potential and denitrification potential, respectively. This analysis helped establish the causation among the characteristics of SPM, composition and diversity of particle-attached microbial communities, and abundances of nitrogen-related genes in urban rivers."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, spectroscopic methods can be used to quantitatively establish the causation among the characteristics of suspended particulate matter (SPM), composition and diversity of particle-attached microbial communities, and abundances of nitrogen-related genes in urban rivers. The text states that spectroscopy was used in combination with other techniques such as 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and absolute gene quantification to establish this causation. By analyzing the spectroscopic data, researchers were able to identify the material composition of SPM, the content of functional groups, and the concentration of SPM, which were identified as significant factors related to microbial communities and their role in nitrogen removal."
