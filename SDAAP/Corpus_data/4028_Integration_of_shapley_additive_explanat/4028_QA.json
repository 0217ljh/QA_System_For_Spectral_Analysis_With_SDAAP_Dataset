        "Output": "Yes, the combination of the RF (random forest) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) methods can be used to interpret the output of machine learning models for satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) in the study. The study used the RF model for satellite-based QPE and then further explored the interpretation of its output using the SHAP algorithm. The SHAP method was able to display the importance ranking of global features with positive/negative contribution values and visualize the marginal contribution values of local features under interaction. This combination of RF and SHAP methods provided a valuable way to interpret the output of the machine learning model for satellite-based QPE and also served as an important basis for the selection of input variables for satellite-based QPE."
