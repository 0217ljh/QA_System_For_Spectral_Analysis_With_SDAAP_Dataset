        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the GA-ELM model with 14 characteristic wavelengths screened by the standard normal variation (SNV) method and SPA can be used to accurately predict the moisture content of dried Hami big jujubes using near-infrared spectroscopy and a variable preferred method. The predicted results of this model showed a high correlation coefficient (R-c = 0.9842) and a high prediction correlation coefficient (R-p = 0.9675), indicating that the model is effective in predicting the moisture content. Additionally, the model had a low root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC = 0.0061) and a low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP = 0.0079), further demonstrating its accuracy. The high RPD value of 3.6788 also indicates that the model has good prediction performance. Therefore, the SNA-4 SPA-4 GA-ELM method can be used as a reliable tool for the accurate prediction of moisture content in dried Hami big jujubes using near-infrared spectroscopy."
