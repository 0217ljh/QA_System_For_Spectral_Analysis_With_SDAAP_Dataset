        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, according to the text, the hyperspectral SWIR imaging detection model can be considered as a superior alternative to conventional wet chemical methods for rapid and effective mycotoxin screening in contaminated maize. The text states that the SWIR imaging model resulted in higher classification accuracies compared to fluorescence and VNIR models, suggesting that it may be a more effective and efficient analytical tool for mycotoxin analysis. Therefore, it can be inferred that the hyperspectral SWIR imaging detection model can be used as a superior alternative for mycotoxin screening in contaminated maize."
