        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of a portable near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer can be considered superior to traditional methods for assessing and monitoring apple hardness in real-time during ultrasonic drying. This conclusion is based on the R-p(2) values and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values obtained in the related study.\n\nThe R-p(2) values obtained for the models using partial least squares (PLS), multiple linear regression (MLR), and artificial neural network (ANN) with selected wavelengths were 0.91, 0.91, and 0.95, respectively. These values indicate a strong correlation between the predicted and actual apple hardness values.\n\nAdditionally, the RMSEP values obtained for the models using PLS, MLR, and ANN were 14.78 N, 14.85 N, and 12.46 N, respectively. A lower RMSEP value indicates a smaller difference between the predicted and actual apple hardness values, suggesting higher accuracy in the predictions.\n\nTherefore, based on the high R-p(2) values and low RMSEP values obtained in the related study, the use of a portable NIR spectrometer can be considered superior to traditional methods for assessing and monitoring apple hardness in real-time during ultrasonic drying."
