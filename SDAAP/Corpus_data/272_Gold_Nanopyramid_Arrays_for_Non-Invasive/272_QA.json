        "input": "",
        "Output": "The algorithm prediction accuracies obtained from the analysis of sEVs in tissue, blood, and saliva samples using SERS were reported to be 90%, 85%, and 72% respectively. The area under the curve values for each receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.96, 0.91, and 0.65 in tissue, blood, and saliva respectively.\n\nComparing these results to traditional methods, such as barium-meal gastric photofluorography and upper endoscopy, it can be inferred that the algorithm prediction accuracies and area under the curve values obtained from the analysis of sEVs using SERS are relatively high. This suggests that the SERS-based methodology has the potential to be considered superior to traditional methods for non-invasive disease detection, at least in the case of gastric cancer. "
