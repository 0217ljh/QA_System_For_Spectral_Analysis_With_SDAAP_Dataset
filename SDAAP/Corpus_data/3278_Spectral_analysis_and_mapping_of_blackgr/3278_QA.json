        "Output": "The researchers determined the most discriminating Spectral Index (SI) for mapping blackgrass weed in wheat fields using UAV, multispectral imagery, and machine learning techniques by generating 18 widely-used SIs from 5 raw spectral bands. They then adopted various feature selection algorithms to improve model simplicity and empirical interpretability. The experimental results showed that the triangular greenness index (TGI), composed of Green-NIR, was the most discriminating SI for this purpose."
