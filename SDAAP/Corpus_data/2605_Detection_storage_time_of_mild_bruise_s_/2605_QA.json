        "Output": "Yes, the combined hyperspectral imaging and machine learning method can be used to effectively distinguish the different storage times of mild bruise's yellow peaches, as compared to traditional methods. The results of the study showed that the overall accuracy of the XGBoost model based on spectral features, image features, and spectral features combined with image features was 77.50%, 87.50%, and 90.00% respectively. Additionally, by using the Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) algorithm to screen the wavelength of the normalized spectral data and fusing it with the image feature data, an XGBoost model with an overall model accuracy of 95.00% was built. This demonstrates that the combined method outperforms traditional detection methods in accurately distinguishing the different storage times of mild bruise's yellow peaches."
