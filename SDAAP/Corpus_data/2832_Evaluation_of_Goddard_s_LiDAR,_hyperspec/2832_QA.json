        "Output": "The synthesis of G-LiHT hyperspectral and LiDAR-CHM products outperforms traditional methods in achieving high overall accuracy and Kappa value for mapping urban land-cover types. According to the study, when ensemble analysis was applied to the fusion of G-LiHT hyperspectral and LiDAR-CHM products, the overall accuracy reached 96.3% and the Kappa value was 0.95. This indicates that the integrated approach using G-LiHT data and ensemble analysis is highly effective in accurately classifying urban land-cover types."
