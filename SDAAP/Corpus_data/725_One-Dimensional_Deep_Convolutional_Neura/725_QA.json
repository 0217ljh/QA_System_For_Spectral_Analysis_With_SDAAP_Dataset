        "Output": "The researchers proposed a spectral data classification model based on a 1D deep CNN (convolutional neural network) to classify and recognize hundreds of classes in the related study. They used the RRUFF Raman spectrum database, which contains many mineral samples, to construct two sub-datasets. These sub-datasets were then used to evaluate the classification effect of the model from different perspectives without data enhancement. The experimental results showed that the model achieved high recognition accuracy for datasets with hundreds of classes and sufficient samples. The researchers compared their model with classic machine learning classification algorithms and 1D CNN models proposed by other scholars and found that their model had higher recognition accuracy, better performance, and better applicability to datasets with thousands of classes and imbalanced class distribution."
