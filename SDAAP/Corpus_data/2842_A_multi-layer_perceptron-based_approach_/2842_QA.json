Spectroscopic methods, such as hyperspectral imaging, can provide detailed information about the spectral characteristics of the oil palm trees at different infection stages. By analyzing the spectral signatures, it is possible to identify specific wavelengths or spectral features that are indicative of different infection stages of the BSR disease.\n\nIn the proposed framework, the first step involves hyperspectral image (HSI) pre-processing, which suggests that spectral information is already being utilized."
