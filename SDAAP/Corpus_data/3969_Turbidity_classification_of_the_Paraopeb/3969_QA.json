        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of machine learning methods and satellite images can be considered superior to traditional methods in classifying the turbidity of the Paraopeba River waters. The systematic experimental evaluation of five machine learning methods - Extra Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine - showed that all methods obtained results equal to or greater than 0.87 accuracy when classifying the turbidity. The best result was achieved using the Support Vector Machine classifier with hyperparameters adjustment by random search, input data processed by the Yeo-Johnson transformation, and selection of spectral bands by collinearity analysis. This method achieved an accuracy of 0.96 with two classes and 0.91 with three classes, indicating its feasibility and effectiveness in classifying turbidity. Additionally, the use of satellite images is advantageous as they are widely available at low cost, making it a relevant alternative to traditional field evaluation methods, which are time-consuming and costly."
