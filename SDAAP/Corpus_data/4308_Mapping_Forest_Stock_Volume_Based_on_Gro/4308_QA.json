        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of FSV estimation in planted eucalyptus forests is the relative root mean square error (rRMSE). This metric measures the difference between the estimated FSV and the actual FSV, relative to the actual FSV. \n\nThe related study states that after adding corrected canopy height model (CCHM) and stand age to the optimal variable set, the average rRMSE of estimated FSV decreased from 41.01% to 29.94% for single LC8 images and from 32.64% to 26.47% for proposed composite LC8 images. \n\nTherefore, the metric of rRMSE can reduce the errors in FSV estimation by approximately 11.07% for single LC8 images and 6.17% for proposed composite LC8 images."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, four machine learning models were utilized to improve the accuracy of mapping forest stock volume (FSV) in planted eucalyptus forests using remote sensing data. The models used were random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and multiple linear regression (MLR).\n\nTo estimate the FSV, various variable sets were used with these models. The importance of the alternative variables was ranked by the random forest model. The study proposed three composite images based on the size and shape of eucalyptus crowns using acquired Landsat 8 OLI images. Several spectral variables were extracted from these composite images.\n\nAdditionally, a corrected canopy height model (CCHM) was extracted from ZY-3 stereo images. The variable set extracted from the composite Landsat 8 OLI images was combined with the CCHM and stand age to improve the accuracy of FSV estimation.\n\nBy incorporating these variables into the machine learning models, the sensitivity between the proposed spectral variables and FSV was significantly improved, especially for young eucalyptus forests."

        "Output": "Yes, the proposed composite images based on the growth characteristics of the crown can be used to improve the accuracy of mapping forest stock volume (FSV) in planted eucalyptus forests using remote sensing data. The study found that the sensitivity between the proposed spectral variables and FSV was significantly improved using these composite images, especially for young eucalyptus forests. By extracting several spectra variables from the composite images and incorporating them into the modeling process, the accuracy of estimating FSV was enhanced. Additionally, the use of composite images related to crown close and corrected canopy height model (CCHM) helped delay the saturation phenomenon, further improving the accuracy of mapping FSV in planted eucalyptus forests."
