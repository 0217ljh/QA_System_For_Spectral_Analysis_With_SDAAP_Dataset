        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction model for the detection of peanut protein content was the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE value obtained for the optimal model, MF-XGBoost-Ridge, was 0.009. This indicates that, on average, the predicted protein content values deviated from the actual values by approximately 0.009 units. \n\nAdditionally, the correlation coefficient (R) was used to assess the performance of the model. The correlation coefficient obtained for the optimal model was 0.886, indicating a strong positive correlation between the predicted protein content and the actual protein content values.\n\nOverall, the prediction model performed well in the detection of peanut protein content, with a low RMSE value and a high correlation coefficient."
