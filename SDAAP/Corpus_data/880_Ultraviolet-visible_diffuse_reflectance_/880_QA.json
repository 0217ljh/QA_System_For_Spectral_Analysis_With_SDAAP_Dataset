        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of UV-Vis DRS and chemometrics is more effective than traditional methods in differentiating Angelicae Sinensis Radix (ASR) from four other similar herbs. Traditional methods may rely on visual inspection or basic physical and chemical tests, which may not provide sufficient accuracy or reliability in distinguishing between herbs with similar appearances or from the same genus. \n\nIn this study, UV-Vis DRS, a spectroscopic technique, was used to obtain spectral data from the samples. Chemometrics, which involves the application of statistical and mathematical methods to analyze chemical data, was then employed to process and interpret the spectral information.\n\nThe researchers collected a total of 191 samples, including ASR, Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (APR), Chuanxiong Rhizoma (CR), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR), and Angelicae Dahuricae Radix (ADR). These samples were divided into training and prediction sets. \n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was used to observe the sample cluster tendency of the calibration set. However, the raw spectra alone were not sufficient to achieve accurate classification of the five herbs. \n\nDifferent preprocessing methods were investigated to improve the clustering results."
