        "input": "",
        "Output": "Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is a novel approach to monitoring E. coli cell integrity during recombinant protein production. The past study assessed various preprocessing strategies in combination with regression or classification models. While the prediction of target compound concentration via regression was unsuccessful, random forest classifiers achieved prediction accuracies of over 90% within the datasets tested. This suggests that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy has the potential to be a superior method compared to traditional methods for monitoring the integrity of E. coli cells during recombinant protein production. However, further validation and evaluation of feature importance are necessary to ensure the reliability and robustness of the chemometric models used in bioprocesses."
