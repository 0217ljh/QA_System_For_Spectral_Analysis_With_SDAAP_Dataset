        "input": "",
        "Output": "Two improvements were made to enhance the accuracy of measuring moisture content in Daqu using a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technique. The first improvement was the establishment of a multigranularity cascade forest model with various scanning window combinations to solve the problem of distribution offset in the prediction results. This helped improve the detection accuracy. The second improvement was the implementation of continuum removal processing to obtain enhanced spectral data from the sample spectral data. This further enhanced the accuracy of measuring the moisture content in Daqu."

        "Output": "The multigranularity cascade forest algorithm was found to be markedly better than traditional methods such as support vector machine and backpropagation neural network in terms of accuracy for measuring the moisture content of Daqu during the fermentation process using a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technique. The coefficient of determination of the prediction set (R2) and root mean square error of the prediction set reached 0.9977 and 0.0021, respectively. This indicates that the multigranularity cascade forest algorithm achieved highly accurate detection and distribution visualization of the moisture content of Daqu."
