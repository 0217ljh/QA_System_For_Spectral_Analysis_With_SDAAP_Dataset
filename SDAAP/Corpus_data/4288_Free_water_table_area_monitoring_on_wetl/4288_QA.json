The ensemble regressors used in the study were Random Forest, Extra Trees, and Bagging. These models were trained and applied for two sessions. The authors utilized the satellite images along with the machine learning models to generate maps of the free water table in the pilot area located within the basin of the Lasica Channel in the Kampinos National Park in Poland. The accuracy of the results obtained from the remote sensing transformations was assessed using high-resolution RGB images obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and control points measurements. The study found promising results, indicating the potential of using this method on a similar scale."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is possible to apply the proposed method using satellite images and ensemble regressors to monitor the range of a free surface water table in other wetland habitats outside of the pilot area in the Kampinos National Park in Poland. The study aims to demonstrate the possibilities associated with the use of satellite images for monitoring moisture on wetlands with a high temporal resolution. The authors obtained promising results, indicating the possibility of using the proposed method on a similar scale."
