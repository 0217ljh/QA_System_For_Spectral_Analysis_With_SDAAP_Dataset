        "Output": "The metric chosen in the rapid and non-destructive classification of bacterial colonies cultured on different agar media was the overall correct classification rate (OCCR) and the Kappa coefficient. The OCCR for the full-wavelength GOA-SVM model was 99.45% for calibration and 98.82% for prediction. The Kappa coefficient for prediction was 0.98. For the simplified model, CARS-GOA-SVM had OCCRs of 99.45% for calibration and 98.73% for prediction, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.98. Overall, the classification models performed very well in terms of both OCCR and Kappa coefficient, indicating high accuracy and stability in classifying bacterial colonies on different agar media."

This is supported by the high overall correct classification rates (OCCRs) for calibration and prediction, as well as the high Kappa coefficient for prediction, indicating a high level of accuracy and stability in the classification models. Additionally, the use of advanced optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) further enhances the performance of the classification models. The results demonstrate that this method provides a convenient and accurate way for bacterial classification, surpassing traditional methods in terms of speed, non-destructiveness, and accuracy."
