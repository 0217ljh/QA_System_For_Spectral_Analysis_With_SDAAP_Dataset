        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models (CART, SVM, ANN, and RF) were evaluated for their performance in estimating the growing stock volume (GSV) of Pinus massoniana plantations in China's northern subtropical regions using remote sensing data. \n\nThe study found that RF (random forests) consistently yielded the greatest precision in estimating GSV, regardless of the input choice. When using spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) alone, ANN (artificial neural networks) had the best performance in estimating GSV. \n\nWhen using texture indices alone with window sizes of 3 x 5 x 5 or 9 x 9, RF achieved the best results. However, for CART, SVM, and RF, the coefficient of determination (R^2) decreased as the moving window size increased, with the highest R^2 values achieved with 3 x 3 or 5 x 5 windows. \n\nWhen both SVIs and textural parameters were used as inputs, RF achieved the highest precision, followed by SVM and CART. Models using both SVI and textural parameters had better estimating precision than those using spectral data alone, but did not significantly outperform models using textural parameters alone."
