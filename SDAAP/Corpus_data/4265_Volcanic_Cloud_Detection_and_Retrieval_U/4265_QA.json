The traditional threshold-based methods, such as the split-window methods, rely on fixed thresholds to determine the presence of volcanic clouds. On the other hand, the RF algorithm used in the related study does not require a fixed threshold and instead utilizes machine learning techniques to detect volcanic clouds using different spectral signatures.\n\nThe results of the study highlight that the machine learning method, specifically the RF algorithm, is suitable for detecting volcanic clouds. The RF model allows for automatic processing of images and achieves promising results, correctly identifying 90% of the area. This indicates that the RF algorithm is effective in detecting volcanic clouds without the need for a fixed threshold.\n\nTherefore, the machine learning method, specifically the RF algorithm, outperforms traditional threshold-based methods in detecting volcanic clouds in this research."
