        "Output": "Machine learning algorithms based on nonlinear regression technology were used for constructing SSC remote sensing estimation models. Various machine learning technologies such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, and random forest were developed and applied for SSC mapping at a regional scale based on satellite RS data. Additionally, spectral indices were utilized as spectral covariates for building an SSC mapping model."

        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the improved random forest (IRF) model for SSC mapping was the coefficient of determination (R2v) and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ). The results showed that the accuracy parameters R2v and RPIQ were greater (0.89 and 3.52, respectively) than the comparable values with the RF model (R2v = 0.69; RPIQ = 2.90). This indicates that the IRF model performed significantly better, with an improvement in accuracy of 28.99% for R2v and 21.38% for RPIQ."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In this study on SSC mapping using machine learning and satellite images, the researchers used a spatial association module to optimize the calibration samples and address the issue of outlier spectral samples interfering with the mapping relationship between ground-truth SSC and spectral features. The spatial association module was developed to identify the outlier spectral samples and remove them from the dataset. By doing so, an optimal sample set was created for calibrating an improved random forest (IRF) model for SSC mapping. This approach helped improve the generalization capability of the mapping model and enhance the accuracy of regional SSC mapping."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of bands 3, 8, and 11 in the Sentinel-2B image for mapping soil salt contents (SSC) using machine learning and satellite images can be considered superior to traditional methods. The related study states that these bands were identified as the SSC-responding bands and that band 11 had a significant correlation with SSC. By utilizing these specific bands, along with optimal SSC-related indices, the improved random forest (IRF) model was able to achieve higher accuracy parameters (R2v and RPIQ) compared to the traditional random forest (RF) model. The accuracy was improved by 28.99% and 21.38% respectively, indicating that the use of these bands and machine learning techniques provided satisfactory results for regional SSC mapping. Therefore, this approach can be considered superior to traditional methods for mapping SSC."
