        "Output": "Yes. The proposed hybrid classification model, RFICA-ET, based on fast independent component analysis and extremely randomized trees, can be used to measure seam strength in laser beam welding in a real-time nondestructive manner using optical spectroscopy and ensemble learning. The model was thoroughly verified with various welding experiments and compared with other classification models such as decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting DT (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM). The model showed promising results and was able to accurately measure seam strength. Additionally, the model identified Al I at 669.8673 nm and Ar I at 610.5635 nm as the two key elements in the dynamic plasma for accurate seam strength measurement."
