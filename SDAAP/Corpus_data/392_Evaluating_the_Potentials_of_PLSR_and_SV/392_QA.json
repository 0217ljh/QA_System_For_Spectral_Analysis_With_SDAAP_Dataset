        "Output": "In the past study, the machine learning models, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were trained and tested using different combinations of VNIR spectra datasets. The training dataset consisted of 80% of the collected soil samples (n= 248), while the validation dataset comprised 20% of the collected data (n= 61).\n\nFor each dataset combination, the PLSR and SVR models were trained using the training dataset. The models were then tested using the validation dataset to evaluate their performance in predicting several soil properties, including clay, sand, silt, organic matter, nitrate NO3-, and calcium carbonate CaCO3.\n\nThe performance of the models was assessed using two metrics: R-2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean square error). The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the predicted soil property that can be explained by the model, while the RMSE represents the average difference between the predicted and actual values of the soil property.\n\nBased on the results, it was found that the SVR model outperformed the PLSR model for two dataset combinations: C1 (0% IS, 100% LS) and C5 (100% IS,"

The past study investigated machine learning models, namely Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), for the prediction of several soil properties using different combinations of VNIR spectra datasets. The results showed that the data fusion improved the prediction of soil properties, with the highest improvement observed for the Soil Organic Matter (SOM) property when using the SVR model and applying the second combination (C2) of 20% IS and 80% LS."
