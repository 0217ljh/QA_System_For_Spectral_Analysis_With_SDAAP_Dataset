        "Output": "Yes, the near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) technique combined with machine learning algorithms can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for detecting adulterated fishmeal. The study mentioned in the text demonstrates that the NIR-HSI technique, when coupled with machine learning algorithms such as partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine (SVM), achieved high classification accuracy for identifying adulterated fishmeal. The use of NIR-HSI allows for rapid and nondestructive detection, providing a more efficient and cost-effective approach compared to traditional methods. Therefore, this technique offers a promising solution for feed mills to identify adulterated fishmeal containing low-cost protein sources such as feather meal and fishmeal from by-products."
