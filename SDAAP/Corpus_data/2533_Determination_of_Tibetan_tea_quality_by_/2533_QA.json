        "Output": "The metric chosen to determine the quality of Tibetan tea is the coefficient of determination (Rp2), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and residual predictive deviation (RPD). These metrics provide a quantitative measure of how well the models can predict the contents of tea polyphenols (TPs) and free amino acids (FAAs) in Tibetan tea."

        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral imaging technology (HSI) can be considered a superior method for determining the tea polyphenols (TPs) and free amino acids (FAAs) in Tibetan tea compared to traditional methods. The study used chemometrics and machine learning techniques in combination with HSI to accurately predict the TPs and FAAs in Tibetan tea. The results showed that the combination of preprocessing methods and machine learning achieved higher prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods. The use of HSI allows for rapid and non-destructive testing of tea quality, making it a more efficient and convenient method compared to traditional approaches."
