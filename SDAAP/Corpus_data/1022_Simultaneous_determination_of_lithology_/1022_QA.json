The CNN model combines laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) with a deep convolutional neural network algorithm to simultaneously determine lithology and seven major chemical elements in rock samples. \n\nThe experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the CNN model reaches 99.26%, indicating its ability to accurately classify different rock types. Additionally, the coefficient of determination (R-2) for the target elements (Si, Al, Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, K) reaches a good level, indicating a high level of accuracy in determining the chemical composition of the rocks. \n\nFurthermore, the CNN model improves the mean absolute error (MAE) of each test sample and prediction relative error of each element, indicating improved accuracy in quantitative determination. \n\nIn comparison to traditional methods such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), and partial least squares regression (PLSR), the CNN model outperforms them in terms of efficiency and accuracy. \n\nTherefore, the CNN model shows great potential in the field of rock quantitative and"
