        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the proposed model is a combination of three metrics: root of mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R-2). \n\nThe RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual values, providing an indication of the model's accuracy. A lower RMSE indicates better performance.\n\nThe MAPE measures the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual values, providing an indication of the model's relative error. A lower MAPE indicates better performance.\n\nThe R-2, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model to the data.\n\nThese metrics collectively assess the model's effectiveness in accurately estimating concentrations of water quality parameters based on hyperspectral reflectance data. The provided results show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of RMSE, MAPE, and R-2."
