        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the classification models in the related study was the percentage accuracy. The accuracy of the partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was reported as 87.1%, while the accuracy of the deep learning model was reported as 93.9%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of NMR spectroscopy and deep learning can be considered a superior method for discriminating the cultivation age of ginseng compared to traditional methods. The text states that the accuracy of the deep learning model was 93.9%, which is higher than the accuracy of the traditional method using partial least-squares discriminant analysis (87.1%). This suggests that the deep learning model, when combined with NMR spectroscopy, provides a more accurate and reliable means of determining the cultivation age of ginseng."
