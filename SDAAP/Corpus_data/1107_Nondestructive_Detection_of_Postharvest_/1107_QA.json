        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the prediction performance of the postharvest quality of cherry tomatoes was the coefficient of determination (R-p(2)), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and residual predictive deviation (RPD). \n\nThe R-p(2) value measures the proportion of the variance in the predicted values that can be explained by the model. A higher R-p(2) value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n\nThe RMSEP value represents the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower RMSEP value indicates a more accurate prediction.\n\nThe RPD value is a measure of the ratio between the standard deviation of the reference values and the RMSEP. A higher RPD value indicates a better prediction performance.\n\nBased on the results, the ELM algorithm using the raw spectra achieved the best prediction accuracy for firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), and pH of cherry tomatoes. The R-p(2), RMSEP, and RPD values obtained were 0.9666, 0.3141N, and 5.6118 for firmness; 0.9179, 0.1485%, and 3.6249 for SSC; and 0.8519, 0"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of a portable NIR spectroscopy system and chemometric algorithms offers several advantages compared to traditional methods in intelligently detecting the postharvest quality of cherry tomatoes.\n\nFirstly, the portable NIR spectroscopy system allows for non-destructive and rapid analysis of the cherry tomatoes. Traditional methods often require destructive sampling, which can be time-consuming and may not accurately represent the overall quality of the batch.\n\nSecondly, the chemometric algorithms, such as Partial Least Square (PLS), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), enable the prediction of postharvest quality parameters (firmness, soluble solids content, and pH) based on the spectra obtained from the NIR spectroscopy system. This eliminates the need for manual measurements and subjective assessments, which can introduce human error and variability.\n\nFurthermore, the study evaluated the effects of different preprocessing techniques, such as Savitzky-Golay (S-G), multiplicative scattering correction (MSC), and standard normal variate (SNV), on the prediction performance. This demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the NIR spectroscopy system and chemometric algorithms in optimizing the accuracy of the predictions.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the ELM algorithm using the raw spectra provided the best prediction accuracy for firmness,"
