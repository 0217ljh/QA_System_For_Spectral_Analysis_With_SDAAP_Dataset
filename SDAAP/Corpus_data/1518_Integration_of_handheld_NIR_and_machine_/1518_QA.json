The research shows that the random subspace discriminant ensemble (RSDE) method outperformed other common classification methods such as partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) with a classification accuracy of > 95%. Therefore, the chosen metric of classification accuracy can achieve an accuracy rate of over 95% in this study."

The research shows that the random subspace discriminant ensemble (RSDE) method used in combination with portable NIR spectroscopy achieves a classification accuracy of over 95%. This accuracy is significantly higher than other common classification methods such as partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). Therefore, the developed method is considered more powerful and effective in identifying the authenticity of chicken meat compared to traditional methods."
