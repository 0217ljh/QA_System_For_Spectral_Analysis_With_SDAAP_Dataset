        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction models of DMI using MIRS was the predictive accuracy (r). This metric measures the correlation between the predicted DMI values and the actual DMI values. The range of the predictive accuracy (r) was reported to be between 0.510 and 0.777 across different ANN models and validation sets."

        "Output": "The different training algorithms used in the related study on predicting DMI of Canadian Holstein cows using artificial neural networks (ANN) were Bayesian regularization, Levenberg-Marquardt, and scaled conjugate gradient. The two types of activation functions used were hyperbolic tangent and linear."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Milk mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (MIRS) data can be considered superior to traditional methods in predicting dry matter intake (DMI) in Canadian Holstein cows using artificial neural networks (ANN). The related study found that including MIRS data improved the prediction of weekly average DMI in Canadian Holstein cows. The models that incorporated MIRS information had superior fitting statistics compared to models that only used milk, fat, and protein yields as predictors. This suggests that other unknown milk components captured by MIRS may help explain the variation in DMI. "
