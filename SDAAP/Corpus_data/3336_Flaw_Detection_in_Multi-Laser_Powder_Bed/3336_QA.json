The time series data generated from the multi-spectral sensors, which monitor spectral emissions at two material-dependent wavelengths, are converted into a rasterized image per layer. These rasterized images, along with the context factors, are then fed into a supervised deep learning-based semantic segmentation pipeline. By including the context factors as input features, the deep learning model is able to discriminate between nominal process variations and anomalies more effectively."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the integration of multi-spectral sensors and deep learning-based semantic segmentation can be considered a superior method for flaw detection in the novel in situ sensing and machine learning-based flaw detection system for M-LPBF. This is because the multi-spectral sensors monitor spectral emissions at two material-dependent wavelengths, allowing for more comprehensive and accurate data collection. The time series data generated from these sensors are then converted into rasterized images per layer, which are fed into a supervised deep learning-based semantic segmentation pipeline. By incorporating context factors such as laser scan direction, processing parameters, and multi-laser proximity, the deep learning model can effectively discriminate between nominal process variations and anomalies. This approach enables the system to detect flaws and other process anomalies in real-time during the M-LPBF process, improving the overall quality and reliability of the additive manufacturing process."
