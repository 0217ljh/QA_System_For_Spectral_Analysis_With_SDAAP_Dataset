        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fusion of HSI and RGB images using the HRFN (HSI-RGB fusion network) in the identification method for soybean kernel damages contributes to the accuracy and reliability of the method compared to traditional methods in the following ways:\n\n1. Super-resolution and spectral modification modules: The HRFN is designed with these modules to process the registered HSI and RGB image pairs and generate super-resolution HSI (SR-HSI) images. This process enhances the spatial resolution of the HSI images, which helps to overcome the low spatial resolution limitation of HSI. By fusing the HSI and RGB images, the HRFN produces high-quality fusion images with improved spatial promotion and satisfactory spectral conservation.\n\n2. Optimal image set of effective wavelengths (OISEW): The SR-HSI images obtained from the HRFN are further processed using support vector machine and ShuffleNet to identify the optimal image set of effective wavelengths. This selection process helps to identify the most informative spectral bands for accurate classification of soybean kernel damages.\n\n3. ShuffleNet_COCSP: The improved ShuffleNet architecture, known as ShuffleNet_COCSP, is used to build classification models based on the OISEW of SR-HSI images."
