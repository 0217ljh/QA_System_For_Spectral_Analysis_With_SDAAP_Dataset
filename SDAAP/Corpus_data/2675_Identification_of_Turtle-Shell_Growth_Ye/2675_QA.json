        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral imaging combined with a deep learning algorithm can be considered a superior method for determining the growth year of turtle shells compared to traditional machine learning methods that solely rely on spectral information. The study demonstrated that the proposed model, named SSA-3DTE, achieved superior classification accuracy of 98.94% on average for five-category classification. This outperformed traditional machine learning methods that only used spectral information and representative deep learning methods. The results of the study suggest that the combination of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning algorithms can effectively leverage both spatial and spectral information within hyperspectral data, leading to more accurate determination of the growth year of turtle shells."
