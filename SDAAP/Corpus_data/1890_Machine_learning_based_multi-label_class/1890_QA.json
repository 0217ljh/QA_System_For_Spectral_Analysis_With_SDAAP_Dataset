        "Output": "The metric chosen in the study was the example-based metric Accexam (Acce_exam). This metric was used for global accuracy evaluation. The study achieved an overall Accexam of 81.2% on the independent testing cohort 1 and 76.4% on the independent testing cohort 2. Therefore, the metric was able to achieve a relatively high accuracy in identifying the compositions of urinary stones in vivo using the proposed methodology."

        "Output": "The multi-criterion weighted fusion approach used in the study is a method of integrating the classification decisions from the top performance models. It involves building 250 multi-label models and combining their predictions using a weighted fusion approach. The weights assigned to each model's prediction are determined based on its performance, and the fusion process aims to reach a consensus prediction."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the parameters extracted from the energy spectrum analysis (ESA) on spectral CT can be used to accurately identify the compositions of urinary stones in vivo. The study utilized a multi-label classification fusion framework, which achieved high accuracy in identifying the compositions of urinary stones. The overall accuracy (Accexam) was 81.2%, and the label-wise accuracy (Acclabel) ranged from 80.6% to 95.0% for different stone compositions on the independent testing cohort 1. On the independent testing cohort 2, the overall accuracy was 76.4%, and the label-wise accuracy ranged from 74.9% to 98.5%. These results indicate that the parameters from the ESA on spectral CT can effectively characterize the compositions of urinary stones."
