        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of crude protein estimation is the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The related study states that the RMSEP for estimating crude protein on a weight-per-area basis is 80 kg.ha(-1) and for estimating crude protein as a dry matter fraction, it ranges from 2.5-3.0 percent dry matter in optimal models."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of the visible to near-infrared range (400-1100 nm) for crude protein estimation based on top-of-canopy reflectance is found to be effective and affordable compared to traditional methods. The study indicates that within this range, using eleven sparse broad bands of 10 nm bandwidth provides performance that is better than or equivalent to previous studies that used a higher number of bands and narrower bandwidths. This means that a minimal number of bands can be selected while still achieving accurate results. \n\nFurthermore, the use of top-of-canopy reflectance for crude protein estimation proves to be highly accurate when estimating crude protein on a weight-per-area basis, with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 80 kg.ha(-1). This suggests that the approach is reliable and can provide accurate estimates of crude protein content in the vegetation.\n\nIn terms of affordability, the study does not explicitly mention the cost of implementing this approach."
