NIRS is a non-destructive and rapid technique, allowing for real-time analysis of multiple properties without the need for extensive sample preparation.\n\nThe incorporation of improved XY co-occurrence distance (ISPXY) and improved grey wolf optimized support vector regression (IGWO-SVR) algorithms enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model. These machine learning techniques optimize the analysis process and improve the performance of the model in terms of average recovery, mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and determination coefficient.\n\nFurthermore, this method is considered green, simple, and effective, making it suitable for implementation in industrial networks.
