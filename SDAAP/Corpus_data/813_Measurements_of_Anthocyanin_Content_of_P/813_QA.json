        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers utilized machine learning techniques in the proposed measurement framework for AAC in leaves by coupling proximally-sensed leaf spectroscopic measurements with these techniques. They investigated the use of both leaf reflectance and transflection spectral measurements across the entire spectral range, from the visible to the short-wave infrared. The machine learning technique automatically performed wavelength selection during the AAC retrieval process. It provided as output the subset of most relevant wavelengths for AAC retrieval, which improved the accuracy of the measurement system. This approach allowed for low prediction errors in AAC retrieval, even when only a quarter of the available data was used for training. The employment of transflectance was shown to benefit the retrieval process, resulting in generally lower prediction errors. Overall, the researchers demonstrated that the use of machine learning techniques in conjunction with spectroscopic measurements can lead to a low-cost measurement system that is easily operated in the field for quick and reliable anthocyanin content measurements."
