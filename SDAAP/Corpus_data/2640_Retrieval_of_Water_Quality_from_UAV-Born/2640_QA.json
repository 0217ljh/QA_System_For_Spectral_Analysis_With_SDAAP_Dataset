        "Output": "The Catboost regression (CBR) model outperforms traditional methods in terms of its prediction performance for the inversion of water quality parameters using UAV-borne hyperspectral data. The experimental results of the machine learning model show that the CBR model has the best prediction performance compared to other machine learning algorithms evaluated in the study. This suggests that the CBR model is more suitable for accurately predicting water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and suspended solids (SS) using UAV-borne hyperspectral data."
