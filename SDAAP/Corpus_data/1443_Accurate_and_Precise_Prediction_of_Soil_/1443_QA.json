        "Output": "In their study, the researchers assessed the prediction uncertainty by developing routines to assess the uncertainty for all models except Cubist. They found that the use of root-mean-square error (RMSE) was misleading for understanding the actual uncertainty about any particular prediction. Additionally, the researchers presented several techniques that can be used to flag predictions of new samples that may not be reliable because their spectra fall outside of the calibration set."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers compared the performance of machine learning algorithms Cubist and memory-based learner (MBL) with traditional methods, such as random forest (RF) and partial least squares regressions (PLSR), in predicting soil properties using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy at a continental scale in the United States. They utilized the large USDA National Soil Survey Center mid-infrared spectral library and associated soil characterization database, which consisted of over 50,000 samples. \n\nOn independent validation sets, both Cubist and MBL outperformed RF and PLSR. The researchers found that Cubist and MBL produced excellent overall models with a mean R-2 of 0.92 (mean ratio of performance to deviation = 6.5) across all 10 soil properties. They also noted that the use of root-mean-square error (RMSE) was misleading for understanding the actual uncertainty about any particular prediction. Therefore, the researchers developed routines to assess the prediction uncertainty for all models except Cubist. \n\nIn terms of precision, the MBL models produced much more precise predictions compared to global PLSR and RF. Additionally, the researchers presented several techniques that can be used to flag predictions of new samples that may not be reliable because their spectra fall outside of the calibration set."
