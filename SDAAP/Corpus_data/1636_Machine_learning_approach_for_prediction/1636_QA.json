ANN was used to develop a model that could accurately estimate the residual concentration of PCM in solution after batch adsorption experiments. By training the neural network with the experimental data, the researchers aimed to create a predictive tool that could be used to determine the effectiveness of CMOP in removing PCM from the environment."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a Machine Learning tool can be considered superior to traditional methods in predicting the adsorption efficiency of paracetamol (PCM) on chemically modified orange peel (CMOP) for environmental remediation purposes. The study mentioned in the text demonstrates that ANN was able to accurately predict the adsorption efficiency of PCM on CMOP by using different operating conditions such as contact time, temperature, and initial drug concentration. The optimal ANN model yielded a high correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.9958, indicating a strong relationship between the predicted and experimental data. This suggests that ANN can effectively capture the complex relationships between the input variables and the adsorption efficiency, providing a more accurate prediction compared to traditional methods. Additionally, ANN has the advantage of being able to handle non-linear relationships and adapt to changing conditions, making it a powerful tool for predicting adsorption efficiency in environmental remediation applications."
