        "Output": "Yes, the SNV-FDSGF method can be used as a superior spectroscopic method for monitoring nitrogen content in rice canopy leaves in this study. The text states that the SNV-FDSGF method, which combines standard normal variable transformation with SG filtering method of first derivative, was proposed based on the comprehensive comparison of different spectral processing methods. This method was found to have high correlation with nitrogen content in rice leaves. Therefore, it can be considered as a superior spectroscopic method for monitoring nitrogen content in rice canopy leaves in this study."
