The models used were extreme learning machine (ELM), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and support vector machine (SVM).\n\nThe ELM model was found to have better geographical traceability compared to PLS-DA and SVM models. The accuracy of the training set for all models was 100%. The ELM model achieved 100% accuracy for both the train and test sets when using single spectrum, low-level fusion, and mid-level fusion of Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) and Fourier-transform mid infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR) based on principal components (PCs) and competitive adaptive weighting algorithm (CARS).\n\nAdditionally, the study also utilized the successive projection algorithm (SPA) for developing models. However, the three models based on SPA were not satisfactory for the geographical traceability of the fungus.\n\nOverall, the machine learning models, particularly the ELM model, were employed to evaluate the fusion strategy of multiple-information technologies and determine the geographical traceability of Wolfiporia cocos fungus effectively."

        "Output": "The researchers evaluated the fusion strategy of multiple-information technologies for the geographical traceability of Wolfiporia cocos fungus using spectroscopic methods by conducting several analyses and comparisons. They used Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) and Fourier-transform mid infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR) with chemometrics to analyze the samples from different regions. \n\nFirstly, they used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to visually compare the effectiveness of FT-NIR and FT-MIR spectroscopy. They found that FT-NIR spectroscopy had a superior effect in separating the samples from different regions.\n\nSecondly, they compared the performance of different models for geographical traceability. They found that the extreme learning machine (ELM) model with optimized spectrum had better accuracy than the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine (SVM) models. The accuracy of the training set for all models was 100%.\n\nThirdly, they evaluated the accuracy of the ELM model with single spectrum, low-level fusion, and mid-level fusion of FT-NIR and FT-MIR using principal components (PCs) and competitive adaptive weighting algorithm (CARS)."
