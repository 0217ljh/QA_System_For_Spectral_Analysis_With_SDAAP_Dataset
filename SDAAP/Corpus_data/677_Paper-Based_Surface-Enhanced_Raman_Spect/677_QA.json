        "Output": "Yes, the developed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy sensor chip using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on ZnO nanorod (ZnO NR) arrays grown on cellulose paper (C) can be considered superior to traditional methods for the early detection of prenatal diseases. This is because the chip has been shown to enhance the Raman signal significantly and has excellent reproducibility. It can measure trace amounts of human amniotic fluids and detect the presence of prenatal diseases with high clinical sensitivity and specificity (>92%). Additionally, the technology has the potential to be used for point-of-care applications, making it convenient and accessible for early detection of prenatal diseases."
