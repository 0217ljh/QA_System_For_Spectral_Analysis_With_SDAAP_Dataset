        "Output": "The key findings regarding the accuracy and performance of the ARTINA method in automating the analysis of protein NMR data are as follows:\n\n1. ARTINA demonstrated the ability to solve protein structures with a median root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.44 angstroms to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) reference. This indicates that the structures predicted by ARTINA closely match the known protein structures.\n\n2. ARTINA achieved a high accuracy in identifying NMR resonance assignments, with 91.36% of the assignments being correct. This means that ARTINA accurately determines the positions of signals in the NMR spectra, which is crucial for understanding the protein structure.\n\n3. The automation provided by ARTINA significantly reduces the time and effort required for protein assignment or structure determination by NMR. The entire analysis process, from NMR measurements to obtaining the protein structure, can be completed within hours, eliminating the need for weeks or months of manual work by trained experts.\n\n4. ARTINA can be used by non-experts, meaning that individuals without extensive training in NMR data analysis can still utilize the method effectively. This further simplifies and accelerates the process of protein NMR analysis.\n\nOverall, the findings demonstrate that ARTINA is a highly accurate and"
