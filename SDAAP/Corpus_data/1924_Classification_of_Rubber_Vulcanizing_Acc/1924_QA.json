        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers used a machine learning model called the extreme learning machine (ELM) to classify and identify the three types of rubber vulcanizing accelerators based on terahertz absorption spectra. They measured the THz spectra of the accelerator samples using a terahertz time-domain spectral (THz-TDS) system in a frequency range of 0.3-1.6 THz. The ELM model was constructed to analyze and classify the spectra, allowing for the identification of the different types of accelerators. To further improve the accuracy of the classification, the researchers also constructed a particle swarm optimization ELM model, which demonstrated higher accuracy compared to the regular ELM model."
