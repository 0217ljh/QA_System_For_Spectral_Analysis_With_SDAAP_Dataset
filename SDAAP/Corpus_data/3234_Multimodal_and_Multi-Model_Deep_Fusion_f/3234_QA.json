        "Output": "In the related study, deep feature learning models, such as random forest and support vector machine (SVM), were utilized to classify land cover in complex open pit mining and agricultural development landscapes (CMALs) by using the features extracted from a deep belief network (DBN). \n\nFirst, low-level and multimodal spectral-spatial and topographic features derived from ZiYuan-3 imagery were extracted and fused. These features were then input into a DBN for deep feature learning. The DBN learned the complex patterns and relationships within the features through unsupervised learning.\n\nOnce the deep features were obtained, they were fed into both the random forest and SVM algorithms for classification. These machine learning algorithms utilized the learned deep features to classify the land cover in the CMALs. \n\nThe performance of the deep feature learning models, specifically the DBN-SVM fused model, was compared to other models in terms of overall accuracy (OA). The DBN-SVM fused model achieved high OAs of 94.74% +/- 0.35% and 81.14% in fine land cover classification (FLCC) and land cover classification (LCC), respectively, outperforming almost all other models."

From this model, only three of the twenty land covers achieved OAs below 90%. Therefore, the fused model of DBN-SVM performed better than other models in terms of overall accuracies for both FLCC and LCC in CMALs."
