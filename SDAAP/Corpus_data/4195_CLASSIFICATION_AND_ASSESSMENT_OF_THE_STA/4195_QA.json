        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy in the related study is the Cohen's kappa coefficient. This coefficient measures the agreement between the classifications made by the machine learning methods and the expert data. The Cohen's kappa coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement and 0 indicates agreement due to chance. \n\nThe related study mentions that the classifications carried out using all the considered methods have excellent agreement with the expert data, but it does not specify the exact value of the Cohen's kappa coefficient. Therefore, we cannot determine how far this metric can go in terms of measuring the classification accuracy."

The related study only mentions the testing of the method in the Stolby Nature Reserve in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. Therefore, it is unclear whether the method can be applied to other regions affected by the invasion of Ussuri polygraphus."
