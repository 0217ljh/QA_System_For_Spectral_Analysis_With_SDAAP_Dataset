        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the inversion model in the past study was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the La element content that can be explained by the spectral reflectance data. \n\nThe R-2 value can range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance in the data, and 1 indicates that the model perfectly explains all of the variance. \n\nIn the past study, the R-2 value reached a maximum of 0.99, indicating that the inversion model based on the method of variable importance evaluation and screening had a high level of accuracy in predicting the La element content in the soil samples."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of the inversion model based on variable importance evaluation is higher than the model based on correlation coefficient in quantitatively estimating and inverting the La element in sedimentary rare earth deposits using hyperspectral soil spectroscopy. The research found that the inversion model of soil La content based on the method of variable importance evaluation had a higher R-2 value (0.99) compared to the correlation coefficient-based model (R-2 value of 0.89). Additionally, the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MRE (Mean Relative Error) values were lower in the variable importance evaluation-based model (11.36 mg/kg and 11.87%, respectively) compared to the correlation coefficient-based model (36.26 mg/kg and 45.97%, respectively). This indicates that the variable importance evaluation method had a better effect in accurately estimating and inverting the La element in sedimentary rare earth deposits using hyperspectral soil spectroscopy."
