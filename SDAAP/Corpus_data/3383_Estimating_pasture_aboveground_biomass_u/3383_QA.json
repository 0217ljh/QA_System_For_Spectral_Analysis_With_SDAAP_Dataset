        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the models in estimating pasture aboveground biomass (AGB) was the coefficient of determination (R2). The tested models achieved R2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.70, indicating moderate to strong correlations between the predicted AGB values and the actual field measurements. The best-performing model had an R2 value of 0.70, indicating a relatively high level of accuracy in estimating pasture AGB."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers used machine learning models, specifically the random forest (RF) algorithm, to estimate pasture aboveground biomass (AGB) in integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) using UAV imagery. They tested several datasets of variables, including original spectral bands (RGB-NIR), vegetation indices, and gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) textures. The RF algorithm was applied along with feature selection methods to identify the most relevant variables for estimating pasture AGB. The models were trained and tested using field measures of pasture AGB obtained through three field campaigns over five months to capture the spatiotemporal variability of the pasture fields. The models achieved similar results in estimating pasture AGB (R2: 0.60 to 0.70), with the number of variables selected for the RF algorithm varying among models (from 6 to 160 variables). The most accurate models used few variables, with two models relying solely on texture measures and the third model incorporating combined spectral bands and vegetation indices. The best-performing model, with an R2 of 0.70, utilized only 10 texture measures."

The related study mentions that various datasets of variables, including original spectral bands (RGB-NIR), vegetation indices, and gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) textures, were tested to estimate pasture AGB using the random forest (RF) algorithm and feature selection methods. It also states that the best model achieved an R2 value of 0.70 using only 10 texture measures."
