        "Output": "The past study aims to provide a more accurate and reliable method for judicial expertise by utilizing machine learning and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to analyze ink marks for handwriting identification. The researchers first obtain a spectrum of the ink marks using LIBS, which allows them to observe characteristic spectral lines of various elements present in the ink. They then provide a detailed spectrum of the ink mark and analyze the influence of different ink components by using different kinds of inks for comparison. \n\nTo build an ink recognition model, the researchers employ the K-nearest neighbor algorithm based on principal component analysis. This model helps in analyzing the differences between different inks and allows for the creation of a database. By combining machine learning techniques with big data, the identification results become more intuitive and accurate, providing reliable evidence for judicial expertise."
