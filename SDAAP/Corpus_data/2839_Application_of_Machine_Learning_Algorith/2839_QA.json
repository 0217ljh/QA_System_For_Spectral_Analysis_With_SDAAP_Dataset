        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms was yield classification accuracy. The study found that the random forest (RF) algorithm had the highest performance with a yield classification accuracy of 84% among all the individual tested algorithms. When the RF algorithm was used as the metaClassifier for the ensemble-stacking (E-S) method, the prediction accuracy increased to 0.93 using all variables and 0.87 using selected variables. Therefore, the metric of yield classification accuracy can go up to 93% in terms of accurately classifying soybean genotypes based on their seed yield."

By comparing the performance of three common machine learning algorithms (multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, and random forest) individually, the researchers could identify which algorithm had the highest accuracy in predicting seed yield. Additionally, by using the ensemble-stacking method, which combines the predictions of multiple algorithms, the researchers aimed to further improve the accuracy of the predictions. This evaluation was conducted to provide soybean breeders with a reliable and efficient tool for selecting high-yielding soybean genotypes at early growth stages based on hyperspectral reflectance data."
