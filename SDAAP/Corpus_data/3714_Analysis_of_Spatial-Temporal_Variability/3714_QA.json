        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed method, which integrates geographic and multispectral satellite datasets, can be used to improve the accuracy of PM2.5 concentration modeling. This is achieved by extracting land use information from both geographic inventory and satellite images using machine learning-based classification. The integration of these datasets allows for the utilization of near up-to-date land use data and spectral information from satellite images, which in turn boosts the accuracy of PM2.5 concentration modeling. The quantitative assessments conducted in the study showed that the proposed method outperformed models that solely relied on either remote sensing datasets or geographic datasets in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-2 (coefficient of determination) values."
