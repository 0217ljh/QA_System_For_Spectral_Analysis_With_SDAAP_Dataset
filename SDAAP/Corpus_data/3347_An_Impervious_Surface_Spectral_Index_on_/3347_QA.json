        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the Normalized Impervious Surface Index (NISI) in accurately mapping impervious surfaces in urban areas using remote sensing data is superior to traditional methods. The NISI was developed based on spectral analysis of impervious and non-impervious surfaces using data from world-recognized spectral libraries and Sentinel-2 MSI images. It utilizes the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands to extract impervious area information.\n\nComprehensive assessments of the NISI have shown that it provides the best performance in separating soil and impervious surfaces from Sentinel-2 MSI images. In terms of impervious surfaces mapping accuracy, the NISI achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 89.28%, a producer's accuracy (PA) of 89.76%, and a user's accuracy (UA) of 90.68%. These accuracy measures were higher than those achieved by traditional machine learning algorithms.\n\nTherefore, the NISI is considered an effective measurement for urban impervious surfaces mapping and analysis. It demonstrates high robustness and good applicability, making it a valuable tool for understanding urban land-cover change and addressing impervious-surface-change-related environmental issues."
