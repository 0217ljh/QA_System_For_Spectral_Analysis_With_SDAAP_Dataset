        "Output": "Yes, the ELM model established using MC preprocessing and the VCPA-IRIV method for extracting characteristic wavelengths can be considered superior to traditional methods in determining the content of exogenous sucrose in black tea using near-infrared spectroscopy. According to the past study, this model achieved the best discrimination with recognition accuracy rates of 100% for both the correction and prediction sets. This indicates that the ELM model, along with the specified preprocessing and wavelength extraction methods, provides a more accurate and reliable approach for determining the content of exogenous sucrose in black tea compared to traditional methods."
