        "Output": "Yes. Based on the analysis of broad bean leaves with different levels of pests and the comparison of artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) classification models on a cloud computing platform, spectroscopic methods can be considered superior to traditional methods for the spectral recognition of crop biotic stress. The experiment results showed that the ANN pest spectrum classification model had higher accuracy than the SVM pest spectrum classification model. Additionally, the ANN model also had higher operating efficiency on the cloud platform. This suggests that spectroscopic methods, combined with cloud computing technology, can provide a new technique and method for the spectral recognition of crop biotic stress."
