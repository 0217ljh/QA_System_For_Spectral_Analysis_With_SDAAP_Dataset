The researchers followed a stepwise approach which included chemical analyses, spectroscopic analysis, and creation of OS spectral libraries. They then generated calibration and validation datasets for the machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe researchers performed spectral exploratory analysis and regression modeling using several machine learning algorithms. Among these algorithms, the k-nearest neighbors model from 1st derivative Visible Near-Short-Wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectra at 350-2500 nm was found to be promising for the prediction of Total Monomeric Anthocyanin Content (TAC). The model had an R-2 value of 0.82, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.52, and RPIQ (Ratio of Performance to Interquartile Range) of 3.56.\n\nAdditionally, the 2nd derivative Fourier-Transform-Mid-Infrared (FT-MIR) spectral fingerprint among 600-900 and 1500-1600 cm(-1) was found to be more informative about the inherent phenolic composition of OS.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrated the diagnostic value and predictive accuracy of using machine learning algorithms and"

The model achieved a high R-squared value of 0.82, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and reference values of TAC. Additionally, the root mean square error (RMSE) value of 0.52 and the relative performance index for quantification (RPIQ) value of 3.56 further support the accuracy and reliability of the model in predicting TAC."
