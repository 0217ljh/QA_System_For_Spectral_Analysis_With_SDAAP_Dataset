        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to improve the accuracy of plant trait estimation is the mean absolute error (MAE). The MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted values and the actual values of the plant traits. \n\nAccording to the study, the FSR models achieved significantly improved prediction accuracy compared to the random forest (RF) models in assessing plant traits for different types of data. The mean MAE reduction ranged from 26.18% to 62.27% when comparing FSR models to RF models. This indicates that the FSR models can greatly improve the accuracy of plant trait estimation compared to the RF models."

        "Output": "The results of comparing the performance of the FSR algorithm to MLR and RF in terms of wheat yield prediction showed that the FSR algorithm significantly improved the accuracy of wheat yield prediction compared to MLR. The FSR models achieved significantly improved prediction accuracy across environments in most validation cases, with mean absolute error (MAE) reduced by up to 28.50% compared to the RF model. Additionally, when validated on public datasets of different species, the FSR models consistently achieved higher prediction accuracy than the RF models, with a mean MAE reduction ranging from 26.18% to 62.27%. These findings suggest that the combination of high-dimensional hyperspectral reflectance data and the FSR framework can provide plant traits estimation comparable to advanced machine learning algorithms, offering an alternative for high precision management in practical production and plant breeding programs."
