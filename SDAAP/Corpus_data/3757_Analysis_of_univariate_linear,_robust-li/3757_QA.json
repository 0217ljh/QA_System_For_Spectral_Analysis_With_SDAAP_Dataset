        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of SDB estimation using ASTER, LANDSAT-8, and Sentinel-2A spectral bands is the coefficient of determination (R2). The related study reports that the linear and non-linear regression models achieved an R2 value of 0.87 for site A and 0.91 for site B. This indicates that the models were able to explain approximately 87% and 91% of the variance in SDB estimation, respectively."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The advantages of using linear regression algorithms (Huber, RANSAC, and ThielSen) compared to the non-linear Gaussian Process Regression algorithm for SDB estimation in turbid and sediment-laden coastal areas with the presence of underwater rocks are:\n\n1. Simplicity: Linear regression algorithms are relatively simpler and easier to understand and implement compared to non-linear regression algorithms. They have fewer parameters to tune and require less computational resources.\n\n2. Robustness: Linear regression algorithms like Huber, RANSAC, and ThielSen are designed to be robust against outliers and noise in the data. This is particularly beneficial in turbid and sediment-laden coastal areas where the presence of underwater rocks and rich sediment can introduce uncertainties and variations in the bathymetric data.\n\n3. Interpretability: Linear regression algorithms provide interpretable coefficients that can help understand the relationship between the spectral bands of satellite imagery and the bathymetric data. This can be useful in identifying the key factors influencing the SDB estimation in complex coastal areas."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, the non-linear regression model used in the study shows promising results for Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) estimation in turbid and sediment-laden coastal areas with the presence of underwater rocks. The model achieved an accuracy of R2 0.87, RMSE 1.77 m, and MAE 1.27 m for depth of 30 m in site A, and R2 0.91, RMSE 1.51 m, and MAE 1.17 m for depth of 22 m in site B. These results suggest that the non-linear regression model can provide a viable alternative to traditional hydrographic surveys in such challenging coastal areas. However, it is important to note that further research and validation may be required to fully establish the superiority of the non-linear regression model over traditional surveys in these specific conditions."
