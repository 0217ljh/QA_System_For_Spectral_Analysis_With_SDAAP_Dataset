        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of extracting tissue optical properties (OPs) using SFDI and LSTMR is the mean absolute error (MAE). The study states that the mean absolute errors of the absorption coefficient and the reduced scattering coefficient are no more than 0.32% and 0.21% respectively. Therefore, this metric can go up to a maximum of 0.32% for the absorption coefficient and 0.21% for the reduced scattering coefficient."

        "Output": "Yes, the LSTMR method using SFDI can be considered a superior alternative to traditional methods for extracting tissue optical properties (OPs) in terms of speed and accuracy. The study states that the LSTMR solution allows for fast and accurate extraction of tissue OPs. Compared to the least-square fitting (LSF) method, the LSTMR method improves the speed of extracting tissue OPs by two orders of magnitude and greatly enhances accuracy. The mean absolute errors of the absorption coefficient and the reduced scattering coefficient using the LSTMR method are reported to be no more than 0.32% and 0.21% respectively. This indicates that the LSTMR method is highly precise in extracting tissue OPs. Therefore, the LSTMR method using SFDI can be considered a superior alternative to traditional methods for extracting tissue OPs in terms of both speed and accuracy."
