        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the model performance in the classification of minced samples of pure mutton, pork, duck, and adulterated mutton was model accuracy. The text states that the spectral information had a great influence on model accuracy, with a maximum difference of up to 12.06% for the same validation set. Therefore, the model accuracy can vary by up to 12.06% depending on the spectral information used."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers explored the influence of spectral information, convolution kernel sizes, and classifiers on the model performance in the classification of minced samples of pure mutton, pork, duck, and adulterated mutton by conducting separate experiments. They varied the spectral information used for modeling and observed its impact on model accuracy. They also tested different convolution kernel sizes and classifiers to assess their effect on model accuracy and classification speed. The results showed that spectral information had a significant influence on model accuracy, with differences of up to 12.06% observed for the same validation set. On the other hand, convolution kernel sizes and classifiers had little effect on model accuracy but had a notable impact on classification speed. The study concluded that the CNN model with mean spectral information per direction, an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier, and a 7 x 7 convolution kernel achieved an accuracy higher than 99.56% for all datasets, providing a fast and accurate method for online classification of adulterated mutton."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of spectral information in single-probe near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can significantly improve the accuracy of classifying minced samples of pure mutton, pork, duck, and adulterated mutton with pork/duck compared to traditional methods. The study mentioned in the text found that spectral information had a great influence on model accuracy, with a maximum difference of up to 12.06% for the same validation set. This suggests that utilizing spectral information can greatly enhance the accuracy of classification in this context."
