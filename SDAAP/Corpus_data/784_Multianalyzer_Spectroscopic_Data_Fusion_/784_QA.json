        "input": "",
        "Output": "The related study assessed the relative advantage of information fusion in enhancing classification accuracy by using a hierarchical classification approach. The related study used commercially available handheld analyzers for X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRFS), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to collect data both in the laboratory and in the field. The data collected from these analyzers were pre-processed using a common protocol. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) were then used to build classification models.\n\nThe features generated by PLSDA, which is a statistical method, were used in the hierarchical classification approach. This approach assessed the relative advantage of information fusion by combining the data from the different analyzers. The classification accuracy of the fused data was compared to the classification accuracy of the individual sensors. The results showed that information fusion increased the classification accuracy from 80-91% to 94% and 64-93% to 98% for the two largest sample suites. This indicates that the fusion of data from multiple analyzers improved the accuracy of classifying the soil samples. The related study suggests that further testing with data sets where classification with individual analyzers is modest could provide more insight into the limits of data fusion for improving classification"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The related study determined if classification accuracy in the chemical analysis of soil samples using handheld spectroscopic instruments could be enhanced through multianalyzer data fusion by conducting chemical analysis on over 100 soil samples from various sites across the United States. The related study used commercially available handheld analyzers for X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRFS), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to collect data both in the laboratory and in the field. The collected data was then subjected to a common data pre-processing protocol. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) were used to build classification models. The features generated by PLSDA were then used in a hierarchical classification approach to assess the relative advantage of information fusion. The related study found that the classification accuracy increased from 80-91% to 94% and 64-93% to 98% for the two largest sample suites when using data fusion, indicating that classification accuracy was indeed enhanced through multianalyzer data fusion."
