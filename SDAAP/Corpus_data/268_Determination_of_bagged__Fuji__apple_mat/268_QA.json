        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. the Vis-NIR spectroscopy method can accurately and nondestructively determine the maturity of bagged 'Fuji' apples using the starch index as the maturity index. The past study found that the prediction performance of the RF-SPA-LSSVM model based on 15 characteristic wavelengths was the best, with a classification accuracy of 89.05% for the prediction set. This indicates that Vis-NIR spectroscopy can be a reliable method for determining apple maturity."
