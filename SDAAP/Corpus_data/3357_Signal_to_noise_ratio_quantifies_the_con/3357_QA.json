        "Output": "The convolutional neural network (CNN) models in the multispectral imaging (MSI) system were trained using two types of images: white light (RGB) images and MSI images. The MSI system integrated three sensors and seven illuminants. The CNN models were trained to classify 11 different types of head and neck tissues. The training process involved comparing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of spectral channels and evaluating the impact of these channels on tissue classification performance using CNN visualization methods."

Based on the information provided in the text, it is reasonable to suggest that the metric developed in this study to quantify the contributions of individual spectral channels can potentially be applied to other multispectral imaging (MSI) systems for improved tissue discrimination and classification during surgery. The study demonstrates that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of spectral channels is a useful metric for understanding tissue classification and quantifying the contributions of different spectral channels in an MSI system. By evaluating the impact of spectral channels on tissue classification performance, this metric can help in optimizing and improving the accuracy of tissue discrimination in other MSI systems used during surgery.
