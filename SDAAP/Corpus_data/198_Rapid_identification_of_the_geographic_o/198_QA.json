        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The combination of optimized variable selection method and NIR spectroscopy can be considered a superior strategy for tea traceability in narrow regions. The past study demonstrated that this combination achieved a high classification accuracy of 95.35% in identifying the geographical origin of Taiping Houkui (TPHK) green tea. This indicates that the optimized variable selection method in conjunction with NIR spectroscopy is an effective approach for tracing the origin of tea in narrow geographical areas."
