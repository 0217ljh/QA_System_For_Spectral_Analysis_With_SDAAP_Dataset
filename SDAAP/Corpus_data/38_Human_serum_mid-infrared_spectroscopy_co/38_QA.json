The research achieved a classification accuracy of 92.00% for the PCAPSO-SVM model, 91.83% for the BP neural network model, and 87.20% for the decision tree model. This indicates that the chosen metric of classification accuracy can go as high as 92.00% in accurately identifying glioma patients using the proposed method."
