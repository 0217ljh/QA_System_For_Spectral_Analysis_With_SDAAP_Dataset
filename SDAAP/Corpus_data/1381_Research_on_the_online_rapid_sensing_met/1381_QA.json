        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction models was the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient of the calibration set (Rc) was 0.9785, and the correlation coefficient of the prediction set (Rp) was 0.9658. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the predicted moisture content and the actual moisture content in the green tea spreading process. Additionally, the relative percent deviations were 3.6787, indicating a relatively small deviation between the predicted and actual moisture content values. Overall, the predictions of moisture content in the green tea spreading process were accurate."
