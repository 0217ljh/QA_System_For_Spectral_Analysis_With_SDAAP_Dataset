        "Output": "Yes, the combination of LIBS technology and chemometrics can be considered as a superior method for detecting cadmium in rice stems compared to traditional methods. The fast detection method using LIBS and chemometrics achieved high accuracy in both qualitative and quantitative analysis of cadmium in rice stems. The use of wavelet transform, area normalization, and median absolute deviation for preprocessing raw spectra improved spectral stability. Principal component analysis was used for cluster analysis, and extreme learning machine (ELM) showed the best effect in distinguishing cadmium stress degree of stems. The ELM model also had the best prediction effects with a high prediction correlation coefficient. These results indicate that the combination of LIBS technology and chemometrics provides an effective and efficient approach for detecting cadmium in rice stems."
