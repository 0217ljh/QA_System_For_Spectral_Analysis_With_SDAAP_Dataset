        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly stated whether the multiplicative scatter correction pretreatment method used in the study can be applied to other hyperspectral imaging datasets for identifying heavy metal contamination in different species. The text only mentions that this pretreatment method was suitable for the Ruditapes philippinarum hyperspectral imaging datasets. Therefore, it is unclear whether the same method would be effective for different species. Further research would be needed to determine the applicability of this method to other species."
