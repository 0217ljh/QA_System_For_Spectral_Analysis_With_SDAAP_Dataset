The related study mentions that optical spectroscopy, specifically infrared spectroscopy, has been widely used to identify bacteria by analyzing their unique signature spectra. The integrative computational approach introduced in the study utilizes logarithmic-based wavelet features and machine learning techniques to measure similarities and differentiate between bacteria. The overall accuracy of the approach in classifying the bacteria is stated to be 92.5%, with high sensitivity and specificity exceeding 92%. These results suggest that the integrative computational approach using infrared spectroscopy and the visual analytics tool is superior to traditional methods in identifying bacteria."
