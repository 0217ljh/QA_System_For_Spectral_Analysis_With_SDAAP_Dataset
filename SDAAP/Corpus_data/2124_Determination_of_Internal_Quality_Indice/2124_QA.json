        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction models for SSC and MC was the R-2 value and the RMSE value. The SVR model achieved a relatively high accuracy with R-2 values of 0.86 and 0.74 and RMSE values of 1.06 and 1.05 for SSC and MC, respectively. This indicates that the SVR model performed well in predicting both the SSC and MC of the oriental melons."

The study mentioned that the SVR model showed the best performance for predicting both the SSC and MC of the oriental melons, achieving a relatively high accuracy with R-2 values of 0.86 and 0.74 and RMSE values of 1.06 and 1.05 for SSC and MC, respectively.
