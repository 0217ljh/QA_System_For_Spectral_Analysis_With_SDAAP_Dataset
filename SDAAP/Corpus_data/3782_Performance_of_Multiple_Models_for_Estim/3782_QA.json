        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, spectroscopic methods can be used to accurately measure and predict rodent activity intensity (RAI) in the alpine grassland ecosystem, as demonstrated in the related study using remote sensing data and machine learning models. The study utilized Sentinel-2A satellite remote sensing multi-spectral data and spectral index to construct four models (MLR, MPL neural nets, RF, and SVR) for RAI prediction. The results showed that the RF model had the highest prediction accuracy, indicating that machine learning with strong nonlinear fitting ability can effectively characterize RAI in the alpine grassland. This study provides theoretical and technical support for monitoring RAI and rodent control in the alpine grassland."
