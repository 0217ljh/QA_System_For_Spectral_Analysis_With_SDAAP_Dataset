        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction reliability of the RFR models was the root mean square error (RMSE). The related study states that the RFR model, which combined weather, soil, plant growth features, and spectral indices, displayed highly improved prediction reliability, up to 85%, with 53-57% lower root mean square errors compared to the model based only on leaf chlorophyll or normalized difference vegetation index. Therefore, the use of the RFR model with the selected features significantly improved the prediction reliability compared to using other models based on different features."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The RFR models in the related study were trained using data collected from 2013 to 2015. This data included information on soil characteristics, weather conditions, plant growth, and spectral index data. The models were trained to analyze the relationship between these variables and canola yield. The 2016 data was then used to validate the models and assess their accuracy in making nitrogen recommendations for specific sites."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the machine-learning random forest regression (RFR) models for canola yield prediction can be enhanced by incorporating spectroscopic methods. The related study states that the RFR model, which combines weather, soil, and plant growth features with spectral indices, displayed highly improved prediction reliability compared to models based only on leaf chlorophyll or normalized difference vegetation index. This suggests that incorporating spectroscopic methods into the RFR models can provide additional valuable information and improve the accuracy of canola yield prediction."
