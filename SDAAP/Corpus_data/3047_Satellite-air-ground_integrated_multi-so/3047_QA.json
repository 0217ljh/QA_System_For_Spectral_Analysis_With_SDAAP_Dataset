This integration allows for a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the tailings reservoirs, as different data sources provide different perspectives and information.\n\nSecondly, the platform enables stereoscopic monitoring of the tailings reservoirs. By combining data from multiple sources, including satellite, air, and ground platforms, the platform can generate a three-dimensional view of the reservoirs. This allows for a more accurate and detailed assessment of the reservoirs' conditions and potential risks.\n\nThirdly, the platform utilizes machine learning processing techniques to analyze and interpret the acquired data. By applying machine learning algorithms to the integrated data, the platform can identify patterns, anomalies, and potential hazards in the tailings reservoirs. This enables early detection of any issues or failures, facilitating a rapid emergency response.\n\nOverall, the brain-inspired human visual multimodal data acquisition platform enhances the comprehensive monitoring of tailings reservoirs by integrating multiple data sources, enabling stereoscopic monitoring"
