They developed a deep learning model, specifically a convolutional neural net (CNN) model, to overcome variations and accurately classify the spectra. Additionally, they employed data augmentation techniques such as additive noise and peak shifting to improve the accuracy and generalization of all models. The deep learning models and machine learning algorithms showed similar success rates for high signal-to-noise data, but the deep learning models were found to be less sensitive to noise. Overall, the researchers demonstrated the ability of the CNN model to classify Raman spectra of graphene with different charge doping levels and subtle variations in the spectra of graphene on SiO2 and graphene on silanized SiO2, achieving a spectral classification accuracy of 99%."
