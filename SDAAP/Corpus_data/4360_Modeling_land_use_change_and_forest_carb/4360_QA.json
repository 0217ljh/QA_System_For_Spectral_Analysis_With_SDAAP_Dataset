        "Output": "No. Based on the provided related study, there is no mention of spectroscopic methods being used in the research on modeling the probability of forest conversion and carbon stock dynamics using USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, or in creating maps showing the risk of areas converting from forest to non-forest. The related study only mentions the use of a machine learning algorithm (random forest) and generalized mixed-effects models, as well as Landsat spectral information, to produce probability maps of forest change. Therefore, spectroscopic methods are not mentioned as being used in this particular research."
