It only mentions that a novel approach based on multispectral imaging combined with a machine learning algorithm was proposed. Therefore, the specific machine learning models used in the study are not provided.\n\nHowever, the text does mention that the multispectral imaging technique combined with statistical models had the potential to distinguish different fungal species in J. curcas seeds after 48 hours of incubation, with high accuracy (>80%). This suggests that the machine learning models used in the study were effective in distinguishing different fungal species."

The study mentioned in the text proposed a novel approach using multispectral imaging combined with machine learning algorithms to classify Jatropha curcas seed health. The results showed that this technique has the potential to distinguish different fungal species in Jatropha curcas seeds with high accuracy (>80%) after 48 hours of incubation. This indicates that the combination of multispectral imaging and statistical models is a rapid and accurate method for detecting and distinguishing different fungal species in Jatropha curcas seeds."
