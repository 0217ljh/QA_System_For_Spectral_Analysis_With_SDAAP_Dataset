        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE measures the average magnitude of the errors between the estimated surface soil moisture (SM) values and the actual measured values. \n\nIn the related study, the RMSE values decreased from 0.041 and 0.05 (cm3 cm-3) in PTF1 to 0.028 and 0.039 in PTF7 for the training and testing steps, respectively. This indicates that the estimation accuracy improved as the PTFs were developed using a combination of basic soil properties and spectral indices. \n\nOverall, the RMSE values obtained for the Random Forest (RF) method were lower than those for the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method. The average RMSE values for the RF method were 0.028 (cm3 cm-3) for the training step and 0.038 (cm3 cm-3) for the testing step. On the other hand, the average RMSE values for the MLR method were 0.032 (cm3 cm-3) for the training step and 0.043 (cm3 cm-3) for the testing step."

        "Output": "The predictor importance and accuracy of the Random Forest (RF) method were compared to the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method in estimating surface soil moisture using a combination of new spectral indices and basic soil properties. The results showed that the accuracy of the RF method was considerably higher compared to the MLR method. \n\nIn terms of predictor importance, the evaluation of results indicated that among the basic properties, clay percent had a significant effect on the estimation of surface soil moisture. This suggests that clay percent is an important predictor in determining surface soil moisture levels.\n\nOverall, the RF method outperformed the MLR method in terms of accuracy and predictor importance when estimating surface soil moisture using a combination of spectral indices and basic soil properties."
