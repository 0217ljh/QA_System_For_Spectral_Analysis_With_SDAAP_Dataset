        "Output": "Yes. The combination of 2DCOS images with ResNet methods, in tandem with NIR spectroscopy, was found to be superior to traditional methods for the rapid identification of the storage duration and species of sliced boletes. The results showed that the 2DCOS images with ResNet model achieved 100% accuracy in both the storage duration and species classification. Additionally, this method was free of complicated data preprocessing, making it a promising approach for testing the authenticity of bolete slices in the supply chain and potentially applicable for quality control of other edible mushrooms."
