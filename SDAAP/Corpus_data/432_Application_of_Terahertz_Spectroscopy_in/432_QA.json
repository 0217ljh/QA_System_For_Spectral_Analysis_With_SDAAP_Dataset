The past study states that terahertz time-domain spectroscopy technology has incomparable advantages in detecting bioactive peptides due to its unique properties. By using this technology, the absorption coefficient curves of three bioactive peptides were obtained, allowing for the comparison of their absorption coefficients. Additionally, a classification discriminant model was established to better detect and distinguish bioactive peptides. This model includes a classifier that selects supervised classification methods and uses intelligent optimization algorithms to select optimal parameters. The results show that the support vector machine based on grid search is better for detecting bioactive peptides, with an accuracy rate of 96% and a running time of 11 seconds. This demonstrates that terahertz time-domain spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms can achieve rapid and non-destructive detection of bioactive peptides, providing a new idea for their detection."
