Specifically, the researchers used a better algorithm called least squares support vector machine (SVM) compared to a previous study. They proposed a new method that enhanced the regression models for ash and sulfur by utilizing the analysis results of volatile matter and fixed carbon, which are organic properties of coal. \n\nTo implement this method, individual models were established for each type of coal (fat, coking, lean, and meager lean). The predicted values of volatile matter and fixed carbon based on NIRS were then added with the relevant principal component analysis (PCA) components during the modeling process. \n\nThe experimental results demonstrated that this proposed method, which incorporated information from the organic properties, improved the analysis results of the inorganic properties by approximately 35% using NIRS."
