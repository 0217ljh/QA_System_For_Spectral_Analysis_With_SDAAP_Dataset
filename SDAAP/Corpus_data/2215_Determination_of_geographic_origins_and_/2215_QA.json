        "Output": "The accuracy of the portable short-wavelength infrared microscope hyperspectral imager (SMHI) system in classifying the geographical origins and root types of Lindera aggregata is not directly compared to traditional methods in the provided text. The text only states that the SMHI system, combined with machine learning algorithms, achieved high accuracies of 97.5% and 97.8% in classifying the geographic origin of tuberous roots and leaves, respectively. It also mentions that spatial identification of tuberous root and taproot tubers in a mixed sample was done with an accuracy of 98.98%. However, there is no mention of how these accuracies compare to traditional methods."
