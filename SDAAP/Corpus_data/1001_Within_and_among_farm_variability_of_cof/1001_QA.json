        "Output": "The research mentions that physical attributes and cupping scores of green coffee are used as metrics to assess coffee bean quality. \n\nRegarding the predictive capability of these metrics, the related study states that the biophysical variables driving coffee quality (including physical attributes and cupping scores) were the same as those driving variations in the near-infrared spectroscopy data. This suggests that the measured physical attributes and cupping scores can be used to predict coffee quality to some extent. Additionally, the related study mentions that the near-infrared spectroscopy-based model showed potential for assessing green bean coffee quality. Therefore, while the exact extent of prediction is not specified, it can be inferred that the chosen metrics have some predictive capability for coffee quality."
