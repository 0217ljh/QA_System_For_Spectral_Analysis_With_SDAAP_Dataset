        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the method is the root-mean-square (RMS) deviation. For oxygen saturation estimation, the absolute RMS deviation was found to be 5.1% units. For hemoglobin concentration, the relative RMS deviation was 13%. This means that the estimation error for oxygen saturation can be up to 5.1% units, and for hemoglobin concentration, it can be up to 13%."

        "Output": "Yes. The presented artificial neural network (ANN)-based method can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. The results of the past study showed that the ANN-based method had an absolute root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of 5.1% units for oxygen saturation estimation and a relative RMS deviation of 13% for hemoglobin concentration. This level of accuracy is at least twice as good as their previous nonlinear optimization method. Additionally, the method was found to be robust to noise, as it performed well on modeled evaluation data with realistic measurement noise and on blood-intralipid phantoms. Therefore, the ANN-based method offers a fast, accurate, and robust approach for assessing oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration compared to traditional methods."
