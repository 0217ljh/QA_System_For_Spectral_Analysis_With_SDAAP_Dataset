        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification results in this study was sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity measures the proportion of true positives correctly identified as positive, while specificity measures the proportion of true negatives correctly identified as negative. \n\nIn this study, the classification results achieved 100% sensitivity and more than 95% specificity for samples with an adulterant concentration of 5% (w/w) or above. This means that the method was able to accurately identify and classify samples that were adulterated with low-cost flours. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of sensitivity and specificity was accurate in detecting adulterant concentration, as it provided high sensitivity in correctly identifying positive cases (adulterated samples) and high specificity in correctly identifying negative cases (authentic almond flour samples)."

        "Output": "The portable NIR instruments were found to be effective in identifying and quantifying adulterated almond flour in the related study. The classification methods used achieved 100% sensitivity and more than 95% specificity for samples with adulterant concentration of 5% (w/w) or above. The PLS models showed coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 0.90 for all models and RMSEP values between 3.2% and 4.8% for purity. These results indicate that the portable NIR instruments are efficient for the identification and quantification of adulterated almond flour."
