        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for the characterization of tea chemical indicators under airborne lead stress is visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. This metric, coupled with chemometrics, allows for the fast and in situ analysis of tea samples. It utilizes the spectral variation of the tea samples to classify them into different treatment groups based on lead stress. Additionally, two machine learning techniques, partial least squares (PLS) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), were evaluated and compared for building quantitative determination models. The results showed that the PLS-RBFNN model outperformed the PLS model in predicting the levels of various chemical indicators in tea leaves. Therefore, the chosen metric of Vis-NIR spectroscopy, along with the PLS-RBFNN model, can go a long way in characterizing tea chemical indicators under airborne lead stress."
