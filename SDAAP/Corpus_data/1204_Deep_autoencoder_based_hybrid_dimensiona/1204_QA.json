        "input": "",
        "Output": "The role of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier in the proposed deep autoencoder based hybrid dimensionality reduction approach is to discriminate between normal and cancer cells. After the Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) technique transforms the spectral features into dimensional vectors, the Deep Autoencoder (DAE) model handles the nonlinearity in the data and produces the latent space. The LDA classifier is then employed to classify the samples into the two classes based on the latent space representation. It helps in determining whether a given sample belongs to the normal class or the malignant melanoma class."

        "Output": "The proposed deep autoencoder based hybrid dimensionality reduction approach with a machine learning model on SERS spectrums of human skin fibroblast outperforms traditional dimensionality reduction techniques in terms of classification accuracy for melanoma cancer diagnostics. The stated hybrid model achieves an accuracy of 98%, sensitivity of 99%, and specificity of 97%. This indicates that the proposed methodology captures both linear and nonlinear underlying structures present in the spectrums, resulting in better classification compared to standard dimensionality reduction techniques."
