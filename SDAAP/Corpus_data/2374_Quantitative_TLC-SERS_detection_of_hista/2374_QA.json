        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the diatomaceous earth based TLC-SERS technique combined with machine-learning analysis can be considered a superior alternative to traditional methods for detecting and quantifying seafood allergens in spoiled tuna samples. This technique allows for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of histamine, the allergen responsible for scombroid fish poisoning, in both artificially spoiled tuna solution and real spoiled tuna samples. The TLC plates made from diatomaceous earth serve as both the stationary phase for separating histamine from the tuna meat and as ultra-sensitive SERS substrates to enhance the detection limit. By using machine learning analysis based on support vector regression (SVR) after feature extraction with principal component analysis (PCA), the technique achieves superior predictive performance compared to traditional partial least squares regression (PLSR) methods. This cost-effective, reliable, and accurate approach for on-site detection and quantification of seafood allergens enhances food safety."
