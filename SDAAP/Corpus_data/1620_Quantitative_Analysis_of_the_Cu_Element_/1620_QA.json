These methods include variable importance measurement (VIM), variable importance projection (VIP), VIM successive projections algorithm (VIM-SPA), VIM-genetic algorithm (VIM-GA), and VIM-mutual information (VIM-MI). Additionally, a wavelet transform (WT)-VIM-SPA-RF calibration model was constructed using a random forest (RF) algorithm."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The WT-VIM-SPA-RF calibration model has the best prediction performance compared to other models for the Cu level in microsized black carbon particles. It achieved an R2P value of 0.9858 and an MREP value of 0.0396, which is better than the WT-RF and Raw-RF models. The MREP values decreased by 37% and 62% respectively when compared to the WT-RF and Raw-RF models. Additionally, the WT-VIM-SPA-RF calibration model demonstrated accuracy, stability, and robustness with low values of RSD (2.8%), RPD (8.39%), and RER (17.79%). These results indicate that the WT-VIM-SPA-RF calibration model is a promising approach for improving the quantitative accuracy of the Cu level in microsized black carbon particles."
