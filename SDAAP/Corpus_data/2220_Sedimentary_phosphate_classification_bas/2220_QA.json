        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of wavelengths in the Ultraviolet (UV) or the Near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges can be used to establish a spectral signature database of phosphate samples for accurate delineation of soil layers during the drilling operation in a multispectral inspection system. The paper mentioned in the text specifically states that a spectral signature database was created using samples collected from the Ben Guerir deposit in Morocco over the 250-2500 nm spectral range, which includes both the UV and NIR ranges. The aim of this database is to select an optimal waveband set capable of good discrimination, which can be used in a multispectral inspection system for accurate delimitation of the soil layers during the drilling operation. The results of the study demonstrate the impact of selecting informative features from the UV and NIR spectral ranges and show good discrimination rates for phosphate samples."
