        "Output": "The metric chosen to develop empirical pasture dry matter (DM) yield prediction models was dry matter (DM) yield, which refers to the amount of dry matter (in kilograms) produced per hectare of pasture. The study aimed to develop prediction models for DM yield using data collected from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne sensor at different flying altitudes. \n\nThe study found that the model accuracy varied depending on the flying altitude. At 25 m flying altitude, the model reported a DM yield accuracy of 328 kg/ha, while at 100 m flying altitude, the model reported an accuracy of 402 kg/ha. \n\nBased on these results, it can be inferred that the chosen metric of DM yield can provide accurate information about the amount of dry matter produced per hectare of pasture. The metric can be used to make informed on-farm management decisions and potentially scale up the technology for farm-scale applications."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The empirical pasture dry matter (DM) yield prediction models were developed using a machine learning modeling framework. Three models were created using features generated from a multispectral sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The models were developed based on three different sets of features: Structure from Motion only (SfM), vegetation indices only (VI), and a combination of SfM and VI (SfM+VI). \n\nTo test the models, the UAV was flown at four different altitudes: 25 m, 50 m, 75 m, and 100 m. The performance of the models was evaluated through independent model validation. The results showed that the model combining features from SfM+VI outperformed the other models at all flying altitudes.\n\nThe importance of SfM-based features varied with altitude. At 25 m, SfM-based features had limited importance, but at higher altitudes, they were included in the top 10 features in a variable importance plot.\n\nBased on the independent validation results, the model developed using data generated at 25 m flying altitude reported the best performance, with a model accuracy of 328 kg DM/ha."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the SfM+VI model was found to be superior to the other models in predicting pasture dry matter yield using the UAV-borne sensor at different flying altitudes. The study found that combining features from SfM+VI resulted in better model performance compared to using either SfM or vegetation indices alone. This was observed at all flying altitudes tested (25 m, 50 m, 75 m, and 100 m). However, the importance of SfM-based features varied with altitude, with limited importance at 25 m but increasing importance at higher altitudes. Overall, the SfM+VI model consistently outperformed the other models in predicting pasture dry matter yield."
