These models include:\n\n1. Self-design Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): This model was used to establish a classification model based on deep features extracted from the near-infrared hyperspectral images.\n\n2. Residual Network (ResNet): This model was also used to establish a classification model based on deep features extracted from the near-infrared hyperspectral images.\n\n3. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA): PLS-DA was used as a direct classifier based on full spectra and effective wavelengths for comparison.\n\n4. Logistic Regression (LR): LR was used as a direct classifier based on full spectra and effective wavelengths for comparison.\n\n5. Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM was used as a direct classifier based on full spectra and effective wavelengths for comparison.\n\nOverall, the study utilized self-design CNN and ResNet models for deep feature extraction, and PLS-DA, LR, and SVM models as direct classifiers based on full spectra and effective wavelengths."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The classification accuracy of the models using deep features extracted by the self-design CNN and ResNet models performed slightly better than those using full spectra and effective wavelengths directly in the study. The logistic regression (LR) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models using deep features as input had slightly higher accuracy compared to the models using full spectra and effective wavelengths. Additionally, the self-design CNN based models performed slightly better than the ResNet based models. However, it is important to note that the classification models using full spectra still had good performance, with classification accuracy of calibration, validation, and prediction sets all over 80% for most models."
