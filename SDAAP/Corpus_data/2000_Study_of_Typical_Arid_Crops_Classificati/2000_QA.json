        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of different classification features has a significant influence on the accuracy of machine learning classification in crop classification based on Sentinel 2A time-series remote sensing data. \n\nThe study found that the Random Forest classifier effectively integrates the benefits of multidimensional vectors such as spectral or vegetation index, resulting in high accuracy. The accuracy of different crop groups in the study was above 89%, with an overall accuracy of 94.02%. This indicates that using different classification features improves the accuracy of machine learning classification.\n\nAdditionally, the classification features extraction method, supported by an object-oriented parcel point set, helps resolve issues such as salt-and-pepper noise and fuzzy parcel boundaries. This method also improves the efficiency and accuracy of the machine learning classifier. The study showed that the classification accuracy of the spectral group increased by 3.13% and the index group increased by 4.07% when using this method.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of red-edge features, such as the red-edge spectrum and red-edge index, helps the classifier capture the phenological differences and unique growth characteristics of different crops. This leads to an improvement in classification accuracy by 2.39% and 1.63% respectively."
