        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms in the related study was the determination coefficient (R-2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (water quality parameter) that can be explained by the independent variables (data collected and processed by the system). \n\nThe determination coefficient (R-2) can provide a measure of how well the machine learning algorithms can predict and explain the variations in the water quality parameters. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit, meaning that the algorithm can accurately predict the water quality parameter based on the given data. \n\nIn the related study, the R-2 values obtained for the four water quality parameters (COD, turbidity, NH3-N, and DO) in the test dataset were 0.92, 0.98, 0.95, and 0.91, respectively. These high R-2 values indicate that the machine learning algorithms performed well in predicting and assessing the water quality parameters. \n\nTherefore, the determination coefficient (R-2) can be a reliable metric for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms in assessing water quality parameters."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, fourteen machine learning algorithms were compared and evaluated to determine the optimal model for predicting water quality parameters. The evaluation process involved using five assessment indexes to assess the performance of each algorithm. The evaluation was based on the comparison of the algorithms' prediction results for four water quality parameters: chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and dissolved oxygen (DO). The performance of each algorithm was measured by determining the optimal determination coefficients (R-2) for each water quality parameter in the test dataset. The algorithm with the highest R-2 value for each parameter was considered the optimal model for predicting that specific water quality parameter."

        "Output": "The proposed automatic near-surface water quality monitoring system is compared to traditional methods in terms of retrieving water quality parameters. The study found that the system was able to obtain high-performance retrieval results for four water quality parameters: chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and dissolved oxygen (DO). The optimal determination coefficients (R-2) for these parameters in the test dataset were 0.92, 0.98, 0.95, and 0.91, respectively. This indicates that the system is able to accurately retrieve these water quality parameters. \n\nIn comparison to traditional methods, the system offers several advantages. Traditional methods, such as satellite monitoring, unmanned aerial vehicles, and in situ underwater probes, have their shortcomings, such as low signal-to-noise ratio, poor time continuity, and frequent maintenance requirements. The proposed near-surface system overcomes these limitations by providing continuous monitoring without the need for contact with the water surface. \n\nOverall, the proposed automatic near-surface water quality monitoring system demonstrates its superiority in retrieving water quality parameters compared to traditional methods. It offers a potential application value in monitoring water quality in various water bodies, including inland and coastal areas."
