        "Output": "In the past study on PMI estimation using cartilage-based FTIR analysis, the researchers used machine learning models, specifically the partial least square (PLS) regression method. They applied pre-processing approaches, such as the second derivative transform of 3-point smoothing and extended multiplicative scatter correction (EMSC), to the spectral data obtained from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. These pre-processed data were then used to establish several predicted models using the PLS regression method. The researchers found that the best model achieved a satisfactory prediction with a low error of 1.49 days. They also identified that the spectral regions from proteins and carbohydrates contributed greatly to the PMI prediction. The researchers concluded that the past study demonstrated the feasibility of using cartilage-based FTIR analysis for PMI estimation and suggested that further work should introduce advanced algorithms for more accurate and precise PMI prediction."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy on human annular cartilages can be considered a superior method for estimating the post-mortem interval (PMI) compared to traditional methods. The past study showed that FTIR spectroscopy could acquire bioinformation from cartilage tissues within 30 days post-mortem, and the spectral variations caused by post-mortem changes were not significantly influenced by sex or causes of death. By using pre-processing approaches and a machine learning method called partial least square (PLS) regression, a predicted model was established with a low error of 1.49 days. The study demonstrated the feasibility of using cartilage-based FTIR analysis for PMI estimation and suggested that further work could introduce advanced algorithms for more accurate and precise PMI prediction."
