        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method for generating training samples for supervised classification of impervious surface areas (ISA) from satellite images is superior to traditional manual methods in terms of accuracy and separability. \n\nAccording to the results of the study, the proposed method can automatically and accurately acquire ISA with an overall accuracy higher than 93% and a Kappa coefficient higher than 0.87. This indicates that the method is highly effective in accurately classifying and extracting impervious surface areas.\n\nFurthermore, comparative experiments were conducted using the biophysical composition index (BCI) and classification by manual samples to evaluate the superiority of the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method had better separability for ISA and soil than the BCI. This suggests that the proposed method is more effective in distinguishing impervious surfaces from other land cover types.\n\nOverall, the proposed method outperforms traditional manual methods in terms of accuracy and separability, except in the case of Harbin where some impervious surfaces with weak light intensity were selected as negative samples."
