        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy in past study was mean accuracy. The mean accuracy was reported to be 0.88 when using spectra of pure tumor tissue and pure fibrosis tissue. However, when measurements on tumor also involved fibrotic tissue, the mean accuracy decreased to 0.61. Therefore, the metric of mean accuracy was used to assess the performance of the real-time tissue classification using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) shows promise as a real-time tissue classification technology for distinguishing between tumor and fibrosis in patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy. The past study found that using DRS spectra of pure tumor tissue and pure fibrosis tissue, a mean accuracy of 0.88 was achieved. However, when measurements on tumor tissue involved fibrotic tissue, the classification accuracy decreased to a mean accuracy of 0.61. Therefore, while DRS can accurately distinguish pure fibrosis from pure tumor, its performance is compromised when fibrotic tissue is present in the tumor measurements. Further research and development may be needed to improve the accuracy of DRS in these cases."
