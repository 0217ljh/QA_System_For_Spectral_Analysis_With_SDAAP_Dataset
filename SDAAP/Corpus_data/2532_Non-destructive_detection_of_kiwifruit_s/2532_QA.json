        "Output": "Six spectral pre-processing techniques were used to pre-process the hyperspectral and fluorescence spectral data for predicting the soluble solid content (SSC) in kiwifruit. The best pre-processing methods selected were boxing smoothing (BS) for hyperspectral data and Savitzky-Golay (SG) for fluorescence spectral data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen fluorescence spectral is the coefficient of determination (R-squared or R^2). The R-p(2) and R-c(2) values were used to assess the prediction performance of the models based on the hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and fluorescence spectral imaging (FSI) techniques, respectively. \n\nThe R^2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the predicted and actual values. In the related study, the R-p(2) and R-c(2) values for the best-performing models were reported as 0.8894 and 0.9429, respectively. \n\nThe RPD (Residual Prediction Deviation) was also used as a metric to evaluate the prediction performance. The RPD value indicates the ratio of the standard deviation of the reference values to the standard deviation of the prediction errors. In this study, the RPD values for the best-performing models were reported as 2.88 and 2.89 for MASS-Boss-ELM and MASS-Boss-PLSR, respectively.\n\nBased on these metrics, the prediction performance of the models in this study was considered to be relatively good."

The MASS-Boss-ELM model achieved an R-p(2) value of 0.8894, an R-c(2) value of 0.9429, and an RPD value of 2.88.

Therefore, the fluorescence spectral imaging technique demonstrated better prediction capabilities for determining the SSC in kiwifruit compared to the hyperspectral imaging technique."
