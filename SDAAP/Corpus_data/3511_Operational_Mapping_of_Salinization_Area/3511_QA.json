        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the quality of the regression models in this study was the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The R-squared value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (electrical conductivity of the 0-30 cm soil layer) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral indices). \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the R-squared value can range from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable, while a value of 1 indicates that the model perfectly explains all of the variance. \n\nIn the related study, the XGB regressor model showed the best quality results with a coefficient of determination of 0.701. This means that approximately 70.1% of the variance in the electrical conductivity of the soil layer can be explained by the optimized list of spectral indices used in the model."
