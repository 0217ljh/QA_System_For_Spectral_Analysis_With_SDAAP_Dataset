        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to measure the classification accuracy of the mapping results of terrestrial oil spills is the Kappa coefficient of covariation. This metric can provide a measure of accuracy that ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect agreement between the classification results and the actual data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers incorporated multi-temporal information and spatial predictor variables to improve classification accuracy in mapping oil spills using machine learning algorithms by including data on the proximity to oil production infrastructure such as pipelines and oil pads. This additional information helped to increase the classification accuracy to over 95%."
