        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study used a spectral library preparation to highlight the perturbation/mixing of pure spectra and incorporated a mathematical formulation to find the perturbed/mixed spectra beyond a threshold. The algorithmic process was employed with the MapReduce model for big data exploration in a distributed environment."

        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the IELM method in mapping pure spectra and perturbed/mixed spectra of minerals is the percentage accuracy. The relted study states that the IELM method achieves 98.08% accuracy with high signal-to-noise (SNR) valued AVIRIS-NG data and 96.54% accuracy with low-SNR synthetic data in the presence of 269 training samples."

        "Output": "The IELM method is shown to have better efficacy than the spectral feature fitting approach in terms of accuracy for mapping pure spectra and perturbed/mixed spectra of minerals using high-resolution hyperspectral remote sensing. The IELM method achieves 98.08% accuracy with high signal-to-noise (SNR) valued AVIRIS-NG data and 96.54% accuracy with low-SNR synthetic data in the presence of 269 training samples. This indicates that the IELM method is more accurate in mapping both pure spectra and perturbed/mixed spectra compared to the spectral feature fitting approach."

        "Output": "Yes, the integrated extreme learning machine (IELM) method can be used to accurately map pure spectra and perturbed/mixed spectra of minerals in the Jahazpur mineralised belt using high-resolution hyperspectral remote sensing. The IELM method has been successfully applied in the large-scale mapping of the Jahazpur mineralised belt using AVIRIS-NG observation. In the validation process, the IELM method achieved 98.08% accuracy with high signal-to-noise (SNR) valued AVIRIS-NG data and 96.54% accuracy with low-SNR synthetic data, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately mapping the spectra of minerals in the presence of 269 training samples."
