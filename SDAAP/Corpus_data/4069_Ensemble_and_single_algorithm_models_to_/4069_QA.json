        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models (MLs) were used to predict rice biomass in both multicollinearity context (MCC) and non-multicollinearity context (NMCC). The MLs were trained and tested using data from a randomised complete block design experiment conducted in the IADA KETARA rice granary in Terengganu, Malaysia.\n\nThe experiment generated 360 samples, including five biomass traits, five spectral bands, and ninety vegetation indices (VIs). These VIs were derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and were sensitive to rice attributes.\n\nThe MLs were used to analyze the collinear VIs and predict rice biomass traits. Both base (single) MLs and ensemble MLs were employed in the analysis. The base MLs refer to individual ML algorithms, while ensemble MLs combine multiple base MLs to improve prediction accuracy.\n\nThe performance, variance, stability (under/overfitting), and confidence of the ML models were compared between MCC and NMCC. It was found that the ML models performed better in MCC than in NMCC for predicting all rice biomass traits."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Spectroscopic methods, such as vegetation indices calculated from UAV data, outperform traditional methods in predicting rice biomass due to their real-time, less destructive, and labor-efficient nature. However, these methods suffer from multicollinearity, which can lead to biased estimation. Various techniques, including linear combination methods and machine learning algorithms, have been developed to handle multicollinearity and improve the accuracy of biomass prediction."
