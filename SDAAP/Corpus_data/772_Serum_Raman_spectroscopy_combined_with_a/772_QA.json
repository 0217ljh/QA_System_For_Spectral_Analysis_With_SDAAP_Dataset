The related study found that the classification accuracy of the MCNN with serum Raman spectra was 94.01%, which outperformed traditional methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) with classification accuracies of 82.78% and 80.89% respectively. This indicates that the combination of serum Raman spectra and MCNN has a good diagnostic effect for identifying thyroid dysfunction."
