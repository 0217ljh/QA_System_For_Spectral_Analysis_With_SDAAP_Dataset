        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers utilized machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to identify the viability of Sophora japonica seeds by collecting hyperspectral data of the seeds in different viability grades and imbibition states. They compared the effects of swelling and aging on the content of water, protein, starch, fat, and total sugar, and established correlation analysis. Among the machine learning algorithms, naive bayes (NB), self-organizing feature mapping algorithm (SOFM), and support vector machine (SVM) were used. On the scale of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were applied to model the one-dimensional spectral and two-dimensional image data. The image-based deep learning model performed the best among the three models, achieving a recognition accuracy above 90%. To optimize the hyperparameters, a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was proposed, which increased the recognition rate up to 99.73% and improved the convergence speed. This study demonstrated the potential of deep learning combined with spectral or image data in identifying the viability of Sophora japonica seeds."
