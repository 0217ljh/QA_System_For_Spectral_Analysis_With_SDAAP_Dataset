The results showed that the accuracies of the classification models developed using Vis/NIR spectrums and machine learning algorithms ranged from 93.3% to 98.6%, indicating that this approach is highly effective in detecting BT disease. Additionally, the research concluded that the SPA-SVM algorithm performed better than the PCA-AdaBoost algorithm in wheat BT disease detection. Therefore, the combination of Vis/NIR spectrums and machine learning methods can be considered a superior approach for detecting BT disease compared to traditional methods."
