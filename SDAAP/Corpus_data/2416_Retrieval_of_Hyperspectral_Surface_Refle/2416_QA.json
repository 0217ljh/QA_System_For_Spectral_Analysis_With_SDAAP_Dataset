        "Output": "The proposed approach for atmospheric correction of hyperspectral images utilizes machine learning models, specifically a support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The SVM is used to learn and predict the surface reflectance from the preprocessed at-sensor radiance image. The preprocessed spectra of each pixel are considered as the spectral feature. Additionally, a hypercolumn based on CNNs is utilized for spatial feature extraction. By training the models with the at-sensor radiance image, the surface reflectance of images from different spatial positions and atmospheric conditions can be quickly predicted without the need for additional metadata."
