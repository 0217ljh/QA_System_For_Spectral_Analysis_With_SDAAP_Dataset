        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the modeling accuracy in the study was the root mean squared error (RMSE). The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the soil properties. The study reported the RMSE values for various soil properties, such as soil organic carbon content, nitrogen content, cation exchange capacity, pH, and calcium carbonate content. The RMSE values ranged from 0.326 to 24.526 g.kg(-1), indicating the level of accuracy in predicting these soil properties."

        "Output": "The effects of data pre-processing on single-task and multi-task deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) modeling in the study were assessed. It was found that spectral transformation was effective for predicting some soil properties. However, spectral downsampling led to a reduction in the modeling accuracy. Additionally, the performance of a multi-task DCNN model built on the basis of LucasResNet-16 was improved compared to the performance of the single-task model."

The DCNN models produced accurate predictions for most soil properties and outperformed a single-task shallow convolutional neural network and traditional machine learning methods. Therefore, the use of DCNNs can be considered superior to traditional machine learning methods for predicting soil properties."
