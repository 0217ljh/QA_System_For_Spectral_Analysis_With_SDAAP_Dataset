        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the correlation between sensor and microbiological data in the analysis of seaweed samples was linear regression. This metric can go as far as providing good performance in predicting microbial population, as indicated by the R-squared values and RMSE values obtained in the analysis."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The purpose of developing machine learning models in the analysis of seaweed samples was to assess any correlations between sensor data (FT-IR spectroscopy, multispectral imaging, and electronic nose analysis) and microbiological data. These models were used to predict and assess the quality of seaweed samples based on the sensor data, such as total viable counts (TVC) of microorganisms."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The prediction performance of the models developed using FT-IR data was good, as indicated by a satisfactory prediction performance on the external test dataset. However, the models developed using MSI data also showed a relatively good prediction performance on the external test dataset, despite having high RMSE values. On the other hand, the models developed using e-nose data from both MI and SAMS had a poor prediction performance."
