        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for quantitative detection of cadmium in rice roots has several advantages compared to traditional methods. \n\nFirstly, LIBS technology significantly reduces the detection time of heavy metals. Traditional methods typically require around 150 minutes for detection, while LIBS technology can achieve the same results in less than 5 minutes. This reduction in detection time allows for more efficient and timely analysis of cadmium levels in rice roots.\n\nSecondly, LIBS provides a reliable method for quantitative detection of cadmium. The related study demonstrates that LIBS can accurately analyze the spectral lines of cadmium, specifically Cd II 214.44, Cd II 226.50, and Cd I 228.80 nm. These spectral lines show a significant positive correlation with the surface characteristics of ablation pits analyzed using scanning electron microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM/EDS).\n\nFurthermore, the related study employed various pretreatment methods, such as median absolute deviation, wavelet transform, and area normalization, to improve the spectral stability of LIBS. This enhances the accuracy and reliability of the quantitative analysis of cadmium in rice roots.\n\nIn terms of multivariate analysis, LIBS can be combined with techniques like partial least squares"
