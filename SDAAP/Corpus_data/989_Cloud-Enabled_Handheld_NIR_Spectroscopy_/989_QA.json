        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the integration of the Viavi MicroNIR handheld device with a cloud-based system can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of expediting routine illicit drug analysis and enhancing overall efficiency. The article states that this technology allows for real-time results, which means that field operators can quickly analyze cannabis specimens on-site without having to send them to a laboratory. This eliminates the need for transportation time and reduces the backlog of samples waiting to be analyzed in the lab. Additionally, the cloud-based system enables data processing and provides a user interface through a mobile application, making it easier for operators to access and interpret the results. By expediting routine analysis, laboratory personnel have more time to handle complex cases, ultimately enhancing overall efficiency in the forensic community."
