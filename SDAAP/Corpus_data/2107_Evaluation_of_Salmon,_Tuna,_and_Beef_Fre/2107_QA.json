        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers minimized the effect of variation caused by using multiple devices in a real environment by using a CNN-based machine learning algorithm with a shift-invariant feature. This feature helps to reduce the impact of device variation and ensures more accurate and consistent results when evaluating the freshness of food using the portable spectrometer."
