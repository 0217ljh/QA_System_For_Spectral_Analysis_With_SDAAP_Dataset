        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral imaging technology can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods for the rapid nondestructive detection of mildew in peanuts during storage. The study used hyperspectral imaging technology to detect mildew in peanuts and achieved a recognition accuracy of 97.7% after applying denoising algorithms. The extracted feature bands were then modeled using various algorithms, with LightGBM algorithm achieving the highest detection rate of 99.10%. This indicates that hyperspectral imaging provides an efficient and nondestructive method for detecting mildew in peanut storage."
