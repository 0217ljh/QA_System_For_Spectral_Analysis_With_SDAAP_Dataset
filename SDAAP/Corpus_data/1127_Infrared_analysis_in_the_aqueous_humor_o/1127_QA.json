        "Output": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was chosen as the metric to distinguish the AH spectra of patients with uveitis from controls in the related study on the molecular composition of AH samples. The accuracy of this metric was sufficient to classify the AH FT-IR spectra of patients with uveitis from those of the control group, as well as to differentiate between severe acute uveitis with active processes (Class 1) and chronic/relapsing uveitis (Class 2) and the control group (Class 3)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) absorbance spectroscopy has been shown to be reliable in distinguishing patients with uveitis from controls based on the molecular composition of aqueous humor (AH) samples. In the study mentioned, FT-IR absorbance spectroscopy was used to analyze 72 AH samples collected from 26 patients with uveitis and 44 controls. The analysis involved reducing hundreds of IR variables to those most representative using principal component analysis and unsupervised agglomerative cluster analysis. The resulting predictive model successfully distinguished the AH spectra of patients with uveitis from controls. This finding suggests that the IR spectral pattern of AH can reflect specific uveal diseases. However, it is important to note that further research and validation studies are needed to confirm the reliability of this method in clinical practice."
