The different combinations of preprocessing and modeling achieved classification accuracies ranging from 71% to 99.7% after cross-validation. The maximum mean classification accuracy achieved was 99.7% using the combination of Savitzky-Golay preprocessing and Support Vector Machine."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of Vis-NIR spectroscopy, appropriate preprocessing, and machine learning methods can be considered a superior approach for rapidly and non-destructively classifying Amaranthus species in different geographical regions of South Korea. The past study investigated the feasibility of using this approach and found that it achieved high classification accuracies ranging from 71% to 99.7% after cross-validation. The combination of Savitzky-Golay preprocessing and Support Vector Machine showed the maximum mean classification accuracy of 99.7% for discriminating Amaranthus species. Therefore, this approach can effectively classify Amaranthus species for the management of weedy species and monitoring their food applications."
