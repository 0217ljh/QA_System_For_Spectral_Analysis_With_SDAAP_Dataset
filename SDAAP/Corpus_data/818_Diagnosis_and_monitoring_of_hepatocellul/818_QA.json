The spectral signatures of HCC were reliably different from those of healthy individuals, indicating the potential of ATR-FTIR for HCC detection.\n\nFurthermore, the related study also showed that PCA-LDA and SVM models were able to accurately classify the non-angio-invasive HCC and angio-invasive HCC status. PCA-LDA achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 86.21% for categorization, while SVM showed a training accuracy of 98.28% and a cross-validation accuracy of 82.75%. External validation for SVM-based classification demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity in accurately classifying the samples.\n\nThese results suggest that ATR-FT"
