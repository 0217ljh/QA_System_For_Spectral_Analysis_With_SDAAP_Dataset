        "Output": "Standard normal variate (SNV) was used to eliminate the effect of instrument and environment on spectra. The sample set partitioning based on joint x\u2013y distances method was applied to divide the samples into calibration set and prediction set as the ratio of 3:1. Successive projection algorithm (SPA) and uninformative variable elimination (UVE) method were used to select effective wavelengths (EWs) from the full spectra."

        "Output": "The metric chosen for nondestructive determination of soluble solids content (SSC) of fruits produced in different places and bagged with different materials during ripening was the correlation coefficient. The optimal SSC prediction model, which was the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) based on selected effective wavelengths (EWs) by SPA, had a correlation coefficient of 0.878. The root-mean-square error of the prediction set was 0.908 A degrees Brix."

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, hyperspectral imaging technique can be considered as a superior method compared to traditional methods for nondestructive determination of soluble solids content (SSC) of fruits produced in different places and bagged with different materials during ripening. The study showed that hyperspectral imaging technique, specifically using near infrared hyperspectral reflectance images, was able to accurately determine the SSC of intact apples. The use of hyperspectral imaging allowed for the selection of effective wavelengths (EWs) that improved the performance of the SSC determination models. The optimal model, based on selected EWs, achieved a high correlation coefficient and a low root-mean-square error, indicating its accuracy in predicting the SSC. Therefore, hyperspectral imaging technique shows promise in providing a reliable and nondestructive method for determining SSC in fruits under different production and packaging conditions."
