The RMSE values ranged between 4.3-4.7 years, indicating the average difference between the estimated age and the actual age of the secondary forests. The relative RMSE, which is expressed as a percentage of the mean age, ranged from 25.5-32.0%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning algorithm (random forests) was used in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity at HH and HV polarizations and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared spectral regions. The algorithm was trained using 100 x 100 m training areas obtained from an extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data over the three study sites in the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santarem, Machadinho d'Oeste). The algorithm was used to discriminate between mature forest, non-forest, and secondary forest. It was also used to retrieve the age of secondary forests (ASF). The overall accuracy of the classification was high (95-96%), with the highest errors occurring in the secondary forest class due to misclassification as mature forest. The root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when estimating ASF ranged between 4.3-4.7 years (relative RMSE = 25.5-32.0%) and 0.04-0.08 years, respectively."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combined data of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) can be considered as a superior method compared to traditional methods in discriminating mature forest, non-forest, and secondary forest, as well as retrieving the age of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon. The study used a machine learning algorithm (random forests) in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance data to achieve a high overall accuracy (95-96%) in discriminating these different land cover types. Additionally, the method proposed in the study provided unbiased estimates of the age of secondary forests, with a relatively low root mean square error (RMSE) and bias."
