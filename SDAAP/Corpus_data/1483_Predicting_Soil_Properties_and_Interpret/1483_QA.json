        "Output": "The text does not explicitly mention the specific metric that was chosen for this study. However, it does mention that four chemometric methods were employed for soil property prediction: partial least squares (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), Cubist, and multivariable adaptive regression splines (MARS). These methods were used to predict eight soil properties: soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulfur (TS), clay, sand, exchangeable calcium (Ca-ex), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pH.\n\nIn terms of how far the chosen metric can go, the text states that SOC, TN, and TS had the strongest prediction results, with an R-2 value of over 0.9. This suggests that the chosen metric (which is not explicitly mentioned) was able to accurately predict these soil properties with a high degree of accuracy. However, it also mentions that PLSR produced the weakest models, indicating that the chosen metric may have limitations in capturing the complex relationships between soil properties and spectra.\n\nOverall, the text does not provide specific information about the chosen metric and its potential limitations."

        "Output": "In their study, the researchers assessed the potential of using soil spectral scans and chemometric methods to predict soil properties by extracting pedon, horizon, and spectral data from the United States NRCS soil database. They specifically selected samples collected from 2011 to 2015 that had been fully described and analyzed for the desired properties. This resulted in a dataset of over 14,000 samples. \n\nFour chemometric methods were employed for soil property prediction: partial least squares (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), Cubist, and multivariable adaptive regression splines (MARS). The dataset was large enough that random subsetting was used to create calibration (70%) and validation (30%) sets. \n\nThe researchers evaluated the performance of these methods by comparing the predicted values to the actual values of eight soil properties: soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulfur (TS), clay, sand, exchangeable calcium (Ca-ex), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pH. They used the R-2 value as a measure of prediction accuracy, with higher values indicating stronger predictions.\n\nBased on their analysis, they found that SOC, TN, and TS had the strongest prediction results, with an R-2 value of over 0.9"
