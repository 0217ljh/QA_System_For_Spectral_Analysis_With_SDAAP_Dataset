        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction models for pH and TA is the correlation coefficient, denoted as R. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted values and the actual values. In the related study, the correlation coefficients obtained for the prediction of pH and TA using spectral bands were 0.926 and 0.925, respectively. For the prediction models using the 4 most effective wavelengths, the correlation coefficients obtained were 0.924 for pH and 0.920 for TA. \n\nThe correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, 0 indicates no linear relationship, and -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship. In terms of accuracy, the correlation coefficients obtained in the related study indicate a strong positive linear relationship between the predicted values and the actual values for both pH and TA.

        "Output": "In the hybrid machine learning approach used for NIR spectral analysis to estimate the pH and titratable acidity (TA) of apples of Fuji variety at different stages of ripening, artificial neural networks (ANN) and metaheuristic algorithms were combined. The ANN was used as the main modeling technique, while the metaheuristic algorithms were employed to optimize the performance of the ANN models.\n\nSpecifically, the hybrid approach involved training the ANN models using the spectral data extracted from 120 apple samples collected at three ripening stages. The spectral data was obtained within two bands of NIR. The ANN models were trained to predict the acidity properties, i.e., pH and TA, based on the spectral information.\n\nAdditionally, a hybrid of ANN and the cultural algorithm was used to select the four most effective wavelengths from the NIR spectrum. These selected wavelengths were then used as inputs for the ANN models to predict the acidity properties.\n\nThe experimental results showed that both the models using spectral bands and the models using the four selected wavelengths were comparable in terms of their predictive performance. The correlation coefficients (R) obtained for the prediction of pH and TA were 0.926 and 0.925, respectively, for the models using spectral bands.
