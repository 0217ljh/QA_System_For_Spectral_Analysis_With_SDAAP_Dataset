The research results showed that this model had better determination results for 101 sheep serum samples, with improved accuracy and reduced running time compared to traditional methods. This indicates that the optimized model can efficiently monitor the concentration/enzymatic activity of indicators in real time, providing a new strategy for intelligent supervision of animal husbandry."
