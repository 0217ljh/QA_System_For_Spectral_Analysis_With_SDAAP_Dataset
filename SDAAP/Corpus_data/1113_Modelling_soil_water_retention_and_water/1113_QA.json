        "Output": "The accuracy of spectroscopic methods in estimating available water capacity (AWC) and soil water retention (SWR) was generally better than traditional pedotransfer functions (PTFs). The root-mean squared-error (RMSE) of the spectroscopic methods ranged from 0.033 cm(3) cm(-3) to 0.059 cm(3) cm(-3), while the RMSEs of the PTFs were 0.050 cm(3) cm(-3) for the local PTF and 0.077 cm(3) cm(-3) for the general PTF. Therefore, the spectroscopic methods performed with higher accuracy compared to the PTFs in estimating AWC and SWR."
