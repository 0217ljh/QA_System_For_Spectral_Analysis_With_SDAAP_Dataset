        "input": "",
        "Output": "The deep convolutional neural network TSMC-Net was used to identify the eight volatile organic compounds in gas mixtures based on their rotational absorption spectra in the THz frequency range by training the model on a data set consisting of simulated absorption spectra for randomly generated mixtures. The absorption spectra in the 220-330 GHz frequency range were used as the input for the network. The data set was prepared with absorption greater than thresholds representing detectable limits and annotated with multiple labels. The supervised multilabel classification problem of identifying individual gases in a mixture was converted to a supervised multiclass classification problem using label powerset conversion. The trained model was then validated and tested against simulated spectra for gas mixtures, both with and without white Gaussian noise. The model exhibited high precision, recall, and accuracy for each pure compound. Additionally, class activation maps were used to visualize the decision-making process of the model and identify relevant frequency regions for identifying unique mixtures. Finally, the model was demonstrated against measured THz absorption spectra for pure species and mixtures obtained using a microelectronics-based THz absorption spectrometer. The approach of using TSMC-Net and the data set generation strategy can be generalized and applied to other spectroscopy types, frequency ranges, and sensors."
