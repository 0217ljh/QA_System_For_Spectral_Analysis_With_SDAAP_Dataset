        "Output": "The machine learning-based algorithm contributed to the effectiveness of the NIR-II HSI-assisted methods in determining cancer tissue by providing automatic tissue classification. The algorithm analyzed the complete NIR-II HSI data and used its learning capabilities to identify and classify cancer tissue. This automated process reduced the reliance on subjective human observation and improved the accuracy of cancer tissue identification. By combining the machine learning-based algorithm with the NIR-II HSI system, pathologists were assisted in specimen sampling, leading to significant improvements in determining cancer tissue compared to conventional methods."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of near-infrared window hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system can be considered superior to conventional methods in improving sampling efficiency for cancer diagnosis in pathological histology. The study proposes using a second near-infrared window (NIR-II: 900-1700 nm) HSI system to assist specimen sampling. This system takes advantage of the deep anatomical penetration and low scattering characteristics of the NIR-II optical window. By using selected NIR-II HSI narrow bands to synthesize color images for human eye observation and applying a machine learning-based algorithm on the complete NIR-II HSI data for automatic tissue classification, the system assists pathologists in accurately identifying cancer tissue, size, and margin. The study shows significant improvements in determining cancer tissue compared to conventional methods, as confirmed by experienced pathologists comparing the results to the gold standard. Additionally, the proposed system can be easily integrated into the current workflow, has high imaging efficiency, and does not involve ionizing radiation."
