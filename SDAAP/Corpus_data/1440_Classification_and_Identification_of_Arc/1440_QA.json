Raman spectroscopy is a technique that measures the scattering of laser light by molecules, providing information about their chemical composition and structure. \n\nThe study found that the Raman spectra of the nine archaeal isolates showed significant separations, allowing for the visualization of distinct characteristics among the species. Machine-learning classification models based on support vector machine achieved accuracies of 88-100% in classifying the nine archaeal species. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of Raman spectroscopy, combined with machine-learning classification models, was able to successfully classify the nine archaeal species with a high level of accuracy."

        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were utilized to investigate and classify archaea at the single-cell level using Raman spectroscopy. The researchers applied support vector machine (SVM) classification models based on the Raman spectra obtained from nine archaeal isolates. \n\nThe SVM models were trained using the Raman spectra data of the known archaeal species, including halophilic archaea, thermophilic archaea, and marine group I (MGI) archaea. These models were then used to classify and predict the archaeal species based on their Raman spectra.\n\nThe accuracy of the machine learning models ranged from 88% to 100% when classifying the nine archaeal species. To validate the predicted results, DNA sequencing analysis of cells isolated from the mixture by Raman-activated cell sorting was performed.\n\nOverall, the machine learning models based on support vector machine classification were used to analyze the Raman spectra and accurately classify the archaeal species at the single-cell level. This approach provided a valuable tool for investigating and classifying archaea, particularly uncultured species."
