        "Output": "The advantages of using the ensemble learning modelling (ELM) algorithm compared to other regression models in predicting SOC and TN in agricultural soil using NIR spectroscopy are as follows:\n\n1. Improved Performance: The ELM algorithm outperformed all other models, including partial least squares regression (PLS) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) with and without variable selection (VS), in predicting both SOC and TN. The ELM model provided the best predictions for both elements, with high values of R-2 (0.96 for SOC and 0.94 for TN), indicating a strong correlation between predicted and actual values.\n\n2. Wider Applicability: The ELM algorithm has the advantage of wider applicability, meaning it can be used for a broader range of datasets and soil samples. This makes it a versatile tool for predicting SOC and TN in different agricultural regions.\n\n3. Time and Resource Efficiency: Traditional chemical analysis methods for SOC and TN determination are time and resource consuming. In contrast, the ELM algorithm offers a more efficient approach by utilizing NIR spectroscopy. This non-destructive technique allows for rapid and simultaneous measurement of SOC and TN, saving time and resources in the analysis process.\n\n4. Ensemble Learning Approach: The ELM algorithm uses an ensemble."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the ensemble learning modelling (ELM) algorithm is superior to traditional regression models in predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in agricultural soil using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. The ELM algorithm outperformed all partial least squares regression (PLS) models and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models with and without variable selection (VS) algorithms for both SOC and TN prediction. \n\nSpecifically, the ELM algorithm provided the best predictions for SOC (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.92, and RPD = 4.87) and TN (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.57, and RPD = 4.91), classifying it as an excellent model for SOC and TN prediction. \n\nComparatively, the traditional regression models, such as PLS and BPNN with and without VS, showed lower performance. PLS gave a moderate performance for TN prediction (R-2 = 0.80 and RPD = 2.77), while BPNN without VS and PLS provided better performance than BPNN with VS for SOC prediction."
