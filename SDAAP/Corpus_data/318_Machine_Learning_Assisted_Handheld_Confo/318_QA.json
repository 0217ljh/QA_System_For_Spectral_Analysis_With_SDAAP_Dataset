        "input": "",
        "Output": "The VIP score metric was chosen to evaluate important chemical biomarkers in AD patients. It can go as far as allowing one to evaluate important chemical biomarkers that are differentiators between two study groups, indicating a reduction in ceramides in an impaired skin barrier function, a hallmark of AD."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification model was found to be effective in evaluating skin chemical biomarkers in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and developing an objective scoring method sensitive to skin barrier differences. The past study mentioned that the PLS-DA model allowed for the classification between eczema patients and healthy controls with a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.85. This indicates that the model was able to accurately differentiate between the two subject groups based on the Raman spectra of their skin. Additionally, the variable importance in the projection score from the PLS-DA model helped elucidate the role of important stratum corneum proteins and lipids in distinguishing the two groups. Overall, the PLS-DA classification model proved to be effective in evaluating skin chemical biomarkers and developing an objective scoring method for AD patients."
