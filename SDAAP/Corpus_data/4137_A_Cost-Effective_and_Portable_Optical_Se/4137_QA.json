        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the N and water content estimation using the proposed sensor system is the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the actual N and water content that can be explained by the variance in the reflectance data collected by the sensor system.\n\nThe R-2 values obtained for N estimation using the proposed sensor system were 63.91% for canola, 80.05% for corn, 82.29% for soybean, and 63.21% for wheat. These values indicate that the reflectance data collected by the sensor system can explain a significant portion of the variance in the actual N content for the tested plant species.\n\nFor water content estimation, the R-2 values obtained were 18.02% for canola, 68.41% for corn, 46.38% for soybean, and 64.58% for wheat. These values suggest that the reflectance data collected by the sensor system can explain a moderate amount of the variance in the actual water content for the tested plant species."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the coefficient of determination (R-2) results obtained for canola, corn, soybean, and wheat, the proposed low-cost, portable multispectral sensor system can be used to accurately determine leaf nitrogen (N) content for canola, corn, soybean, and wheat. The R-2 values obtained for N estimation were 63.91% for canola, 80.05% for corn, 82.29% for soybean, and 63.21% for wheat. These values indicate a moderate to strong correlation between the reflectance data collected by the sensor system and the actual N content in the leaves of these plant species."
