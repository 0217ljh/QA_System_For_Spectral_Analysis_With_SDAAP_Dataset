        "Output": "The metric chosen to determine the cadmium (Cd) content in oilseed rape leaves (R^2) for prediction and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for prediction. The stacking ensemble model with random forest (RF) as the meta learner achieved a coefficient of determination for prediction of 0.9815 and a root-mean-square error for prediction of 5.8969 mg kg(-1). This indicates that the prediction method was highly accurate in predicting the Cd content in oilseed rape leaves."

        "Output": "The machine learning models used in the study to analyze the spectra and determine the cadmium (Cd) content in oilseed rape leaves using visible near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology were support vector regression, extreme learning machine, decision tree, and random forest (RF). These models were used as basic learners in the two-layer estimation models. Additionally, support vector regression or random forest (RF) was used as a meta learner in the other layer of the models."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of visible-NIR HSI technology and the stacking ensemble learning method can be considered a superior method for determining the cadmium (Cd) content in oilseed rape leaves compared to traditional methods. The study established two-layer estimation models using visible-NIR HSI and ensemble learning methods. These models, particularly the stacking ensemble model with random forest as the meta learner, showed high accuracy in predicting the Cd content in rape leaves, with a coefficient of determination for prediction of 0.9815 and a root-mean-square error for prediction of 5.8969 mg kg(-1). This indicates that the combination of visible-NIR HSI technology and the stacking ensemble learning method can provide rapid and nondestructive detection of Cd content in oilseed rape leaves, making it a superior alternative to traditional methods."
