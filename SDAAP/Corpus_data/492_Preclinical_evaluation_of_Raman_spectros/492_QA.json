        "Output": "In the past study, machine learning techniques were used to train and test a model that could distinguish between different tissue types encountered during pedicular screw insertion in the spine. A portable system equipped with a hand-held RS probe was used to make fingerprint measurements on freshly excised porcine vertebrae, identifying six tissue types: bone, spinal cord, fat, cartilage, ligament, and muscle. \n\nSupervised machine learning techniques were then applied to these measurements to create a six-class model, as well as two-class models specifically engineered to distinguish bone from soft tissue. The models were trained and tested on independent hold-out data subsets to evaluate their accuracy.\n\nThe two-class models, which focused on distinguishing bone from soft tissue, achieved 100% accuracy in detecting bone versus all soft tissue or spinal cord only. This demonstrated the ability of machine learning combined with RS to accurately differentiate between these tissue types.\n\nFurthermore, in vivo spectral fingerprint measurements were taken during intra-pedicular drilling in a porcine spine model. The soft tissue detection models, developed using machine learning, correctly detected all spinal canal breaches when applied to these in vivo measurements.\n\nOverall, the past study showed that machine learning techniques, combined with near-infrared Raman spectroscopy, can provide rapid and accurate guidance for ped"

        "Output": "Yes. Based on the findings of the past study, near-infrared Raman spectroscopy (RS) combined with machine learning can be considered a superior method compared to traditional techniques for guiding pedicular screw insertion in the spine. The past study demonstrated that the RS system, equipped with a hand-held probe, was able to accurately distinguish between different tissue types in the spine, including bone, spinal cord, fat, cartilage, ligament, and muscle. The machine learning techniques used in the past study achieved high accuracy in classifying these tissue types. Additionally, when tested in vivo during interpedicular drilling, the RS system correctly detected all spinal canal breaches. These results suggest that RS combined with machine learning can provide rapid and accurate guidance for orthopedic surgeons during pedicular screw insertion, potentially leading to better patient outcomes."
