        "input": "",
        "Output": "The multi-camera system prototype described in the related study is effective in addressing the spectral gap in UAV-based multispectral systems. By implementing dedicated bandpass filter combinations, the system is able to capture data in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) domain, which contains key absorption features related to biomass and nitrogen (N). This allows for a sensitivity range from 600 to 1700 nm, filling the spectral gap that is typically covered by visible and near-infrared (VNIR) data.\n\nFurthermore, the system is capable of deriving application-specific vegetation indices (VIs) using the captured data. In the study, two VIs, GnyLi and NRI, were applied to evaluate crop traits in a winter wheat field experiment. These VIs were derived from the data obtained on a single observation date.\n\nThe effectiveness of the multi-camera system prototype in deriving VIs and evaluating crop traits was assessed through regression models. The models were developed using ground truth data obtained through destructive sampling for the entire growing season. Crop heights were also derived from UAV-based RGB image data using an improved approach developed within the study.\n\nThe results of the regression models and validation against the ground truth data indicate that the NIR/SWIR-based VIs derived from the multi-camera system have a moderate to strong relationship"
