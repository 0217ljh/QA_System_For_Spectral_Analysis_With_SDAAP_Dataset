        "Output": "Yes, the high-resolution remotely sensed data can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods for estimating centimeter-scale active layer thickness (ALT) in ice-wedge polygon terrain in Barrow, Alaska. The study demonstrates a new approach using high-resolution remotely sensed data (LiDAR and WorldView-2) to estimate ALT with a spatial resolution of 2 meters. The approach utilizes a regression-based, machine learning data-fusion algorithm that incorporates topographic and spectral metrics derived from the multisensor data. The comparison of the ALT estimates with ground-based measurements indicates a high level of accuracy (r(2)=0.76, RMSE 4.4 cm) for the approach. This suggests that the high-resolution remotely sensed data can effectively estimate centimeter-scale ALT in the specific terrain of ice-wedge polygons in Barrow, Alaska."
