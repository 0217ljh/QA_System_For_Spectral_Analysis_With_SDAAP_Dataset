Specifically, a two-layer machine learning model was established. The Raman spectra data collected from at least 600 single spectra for PHH and ProliHHs at different stages (Passage 1 to Passage 4) were input into the machine learning model.\n\nThe machine learning model was trained to classify the different stages of ProliHHs and PHH based on the Raman spectroscopy data. Linear discriminant analysis was used as part of the machine learning model to successfully classify ProliHHs at different stages and PHH. The overall accuracy of the machine learning model was reported to be 84.6%.\n\nBy utilizing the machine learning model, the researchers were able to identify significant differences in Raman bands within different ProliHHs cell groups, particularly changes at 1003 cm(-1), 1206 cm(-1), and 1440 cm(-1). These changes in Raman bands were found to be linked with reactive oxygen species, hydroxyproline, and triglyceride levels in ProliHHs, which were consistent with the corresponding assay results.\n\nOverall, the machine"

        "Output": "The past study's findings support the potential and feasibility of using Raman spectroscopy compared to traditional methods in identifying different stages of ProliHHs during the dedifferentiation process. \n\nThe researchers successfully used Raman spectroscopy to classify ProliHHs at different stages and distinguish them from primary human hepatocytes (PHH). This demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy can accurately identify and differentiate ProliHHs during the dedifferentiation process.\n\nAdditionally, a two-layer machine learning model was established using the Raman spectroscopy data, which achieved an overall accuracy of 84.6%. This indicates that Raman spectroscopy can effectively analyze and interpret the complex spectral data to identify different stages of ProliHHs.\n\nFurthermore, the past study identified significant differences in Raman bands within different ProliHHs cell groups, particularly changes at 1003 cm(-1), 1206 cm(-1), and 1440 cm(-1). These changes were found to be associated with reactive oxygen species, hydroxyproline, and triglyceride levels in ProliHHs, which were consistent with the corresponding assay results.
