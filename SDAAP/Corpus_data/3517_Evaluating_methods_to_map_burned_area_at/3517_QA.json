        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), is higher compared to spectral indices and supervised classification in detecting burned areas using higher resolution Landsat imagery in Central India. The study found that the detection of burned areas by the global fire product Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) was very low, with accuracies below 20%. However, when using machine learning algorithms like RF and SVM, the accuracies for classifying burned areas were higher.\n\nSpecifically, RF consistently produced high classification accuracies for the month of April, with accuracies exceeding 80%. However, it had a tendency to misclassify less frequently available land covers. On the other hand, SVM had similar classification accuracies but had a tendency to overfit the model, which can lead to increased commission errors.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of including spectral indices (SI) in predicting burned areas, as they had a high relative importance and helped reduce commission errors. Overall, the study recommends using machine learning algorithms for mapping burned areas in the future, as they require less time investment than classification methods and can yield consistent results."

The study found that the global fire product Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) had a very low accuracy of less than 20% in detecting burned areas. On the other hand, accuracies were higher when using supervised classification, random forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as machine learning algorithms. RF consistently produced the highest classification accuracies of over 80% in April. However, RF had a tendency to misclassify less frequently available land covers. SVM had similar accuracies but had a tendency to overfit the model. Both machine learning algorithms had the potential for increasing commission errors and need to be used carefully when predicting burned areas. The inclusion of spectral indices had a high relative importance in predicting burned areas and reduced commission errors. Therefore, the study recommends using machine learning algorithms for mapping burned areas in the future as they require less time investment than classification and can yield consistent results."
