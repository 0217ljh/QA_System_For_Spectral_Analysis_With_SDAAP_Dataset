        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the calibration models in this study was the root mean squared error for the prediction set (RMSEP) and the correlation coefficient (Rp). The calibration model with the full wavelengths pretreated by the first derivative yielded an RMSEP of 1.0338 g/kg and an Rp of 0.9003. These values indicate that the model performed well, as a lower RMSEP indicates a smaller average difference between the predicted and actual capsaicin content, and a higher Rp indicates a stronger linear relationship between the predicted and actual values."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for determining the capsaicin content in dried chili pepper powder. The past study found that NIR spectroscopy, specifically at wavelengths of 940-1660 nm, yielded optimum results with a root mean squared error for the prediction set (RMSEP) of 1.0338 g/kg and a correlation coefficient (Rp) of 0.9003. This indicates that NIR spectroscopy is a rapid and accurate quantitative tool for determining capsaicin content."
