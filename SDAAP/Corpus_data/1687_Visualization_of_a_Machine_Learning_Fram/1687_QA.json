        "Output": "The Vis-CAD framework was optimized for the trace analysis of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a mixture by introducing data augmentation and visual random forest. The introduction of data augmentation significantly reduced the requirement of mass data, allowing for more efficient analysis. Additionally, the visualization of the random forest in the algorithm framework clearly presented the captured features, enabling the determination of the algorithm's reliability. This optimization resulted in a trustworthy accuracy of no less than 99% under the optimized condition."

The text states that the proposed algorithm offers a new way for the application of machine learning algorithms in the much wider spectroscopy world. This suggests that the framework can be used in other spectroscopy fields to enhance sensitivity and improve qualitative and quantitative analysis of trace targets."
