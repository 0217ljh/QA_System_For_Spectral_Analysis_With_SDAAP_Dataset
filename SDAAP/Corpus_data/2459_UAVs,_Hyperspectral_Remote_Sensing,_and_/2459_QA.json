The integration of advanced digital hyperspectral, ultra HD colour (RGB) sensors, and machine learning algorithms in UAVs allows for rapid and continuous monitoring of coral reefs. This technology enables the collection of high-resolution imagery and the ability to detect and classify different types of coral and signs of coral bleaching. Additionally, the combination of airborne RGB and hyperspectral imagery with in-water survey data enhances the accuracy of the monitoring process. The development of this methodology provides coral reef researchers, other scientists, and UAV practitioners with efficient and accurate remote sensing techniques for monitoring and analyzing coral reef health."
