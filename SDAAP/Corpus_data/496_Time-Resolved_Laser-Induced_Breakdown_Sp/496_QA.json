        "Output": "The metric used to solve the adulteration problem of brown rice flour in the commodity market was classification accuracy. The classification accuracy of the traditional machine learning models (LDA, NB, and SVM) based on TR-LIBS had a significant improvement of 3-11% compared to traditional LIBS. Additionally, the deep learning classification model based on TR-LIBS achieved similar results with an accuracy increase of more than 8%. "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the proposed TR-LIBS detection method is significantly better than traditional methods in identifying brown rice flour adulteration. For qualitative analysis, the machine learning models based on TR-LIBS (LDA, NB, and SVM) have classification accuracy that is 3-11% higher than those based on traditional LIBS. The deep learning classification model based on TR-LIBS also achieves similar results with an accuracy increase of more than 8%. \n\nFor quantitative analysis, the quantitative model based on TR-LIBS reduces the limit of detection (LOD) of five adulterants from about 8-51% to 4-19%, effectively improving the quantitative detection performance. \n\nAdditionally, t-SNE visualization demonstrates that there are more obvious boundaries between different types of samples based on TR-LIBS, further highlighting the superior performance of this method in identifying brown rice flour adulteration."
