        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, the combination of back propagation neural network (BPNN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods, referred to as the PSO-BPNN method, was used to estimate the contents of soil heavy metals (Cd, Hg, and As). The PSO-BPNN method significantly improved the estimation accuracy of the soil heavy metal contents compared to using only BPNN. \n\nThe improvement in estimation accuracy was demonstrated by a decrease in the mean relative error (MRE) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) by 68% to 71% and 64% to 67%, respectively. This indicates that the PSO-BPNN method provided a more accurate estimation of the soil heavy metal contents.\n\nAdditionally, the PSO-BPNN method showed great potential for mapping the heavy metal content in soil. It was able to map the Cd content using HuanJing-1A Hyperspectral Imager (HSI) data with a RRMSE value of 36%. This suggests that the PSO-BPNN method can be utilized to estimate and map soil heavy metal contents in large areas using both field spectral data and hyperspectral imagery."
