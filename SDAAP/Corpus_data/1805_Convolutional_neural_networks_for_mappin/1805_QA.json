        "Output": "The performance of the proposed CNN method for particle size mapping in sediment cores was compared to the random forest (RF) algorithm. According to the leave-one-out evaluation method, the CNN method showed improvement in several metrics compared to the best RF algorithm. \n\nSpecifically, the CNN method demonstrated an improvement of 14% for R2 (coefficient of determination), 4.58 for MAE (mean absolute error), 5.45 for RMSE (root mean square error), and 0.83 for RPD (ratio of performance to deviation) relative to the best RF algorithm. \n\nThese results indicate that the CNN method outperformed the traditional RF algorithm in terms of accuracy and precision in predicting particle size in sediment cores. Therefore, the proposed CNN method can be considered a reliable and effective approach for mapping particle size in sediment cores from lakes with varying climatic and environmental characteristics."
