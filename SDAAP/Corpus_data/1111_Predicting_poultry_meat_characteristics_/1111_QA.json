        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction models in the related study was the coefficient of determination. The results showed that the coefficient of determination was greater than or equal to 0.5 for nine out of twelve targets, indicating a moderate to strong correlation between the predicted values and the actual values. The prediction errors were also comparable to the errors obtained by traditional analysis, suggesting that the predictions were reasonably accurate."

        "Output": "The performance of the Multi-target Augmented Stacking (MTAS) method in predicting twelve poultry meat characteristics using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was compared to traditional analysis methods. The results showed that the coefficient of determination was greater than or equal to 0.5 for nine out of twelve targets, indicating a good predictive accuracy. The prediction errors obtained by the MTAS method were comparable to those obtained by traditional analysis methods. Additionally, the MTAS method was statistically superior to the Single-target (ST) method. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, which were used in the MTAS method, outperformed the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm. Overall, the MTAS method using NIR spectroscopy provided a new tool for accurately identifying poultry meat attributes."
