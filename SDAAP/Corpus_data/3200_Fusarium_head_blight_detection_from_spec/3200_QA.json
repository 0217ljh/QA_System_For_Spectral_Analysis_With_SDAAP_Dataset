        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictive models' performance in the Fusarium head blight phenotyping trial was the ordinal SVM models applied to the raw spectra, which yielded predictions with confident distinction of low, moderate, and high disease severity at the milk-ripening developmental phase. This metric can provide accurate predictions for different levels of disease severity at this specific developmental phase."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The impact of spike-drying on the quality of predictions in the Fusarium head blight phenotyping trial was a deterioration in prediction quality. This deterioration was observed during the wax-ripening campaign. It is presumed that the spike-drying process contributed to this decline in prediction quality."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, spectroscopic methods can be considered as a valuable tool in disease resistance phenotyping of winter wheat spikes in a Fusarium head blight phenotyping trial. The related study states that spectral signatures can be analyzed to derive infection severity scores and screen breeding lines. The study used spectroscopic methods to acquire hyper spectra of winter wheat spikes at different phenological phases and trained predictive models to assign severity levels based on the acquired spectra. The models trained on spectra acquired at the milk-ripening phase were able to reliably distinguish between low, medium, and high symptom severity with high accuracy."
