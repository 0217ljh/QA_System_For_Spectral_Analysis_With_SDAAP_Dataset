        "Output": "The purpose of adding a dual convolution structure to the 1D-CNN model in the classification of LIF data was to improve the classification effects. The dual convolution structure allows the features of the 1-dimensional spectra to be more scattered within one convolution-pooling process, resulting in enhanced classification accuracy."

        "instruction": "How does the addition of a dual convolution structure in the 1D-CNN model improve the classification effects of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) data compared to traditional methods?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The addition of a dual convolution structure in the 1D-CNN model improves the classification effects of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) data compared to traditional methods by scattering the features of the 1-dimensional spectra within one convolution-pooling process. This scattering of features allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the data, leading to improved classification accuracy. The dual convolution structure enhances the ability of the model to capture and extract relevant information from the LIF spectra, resulting in better classification performance. Additionally, the dual-conv model structure has a faster convergence speed and higher evaluation parameters compared to the 1D-CNN model, without increasing the data dimension."
