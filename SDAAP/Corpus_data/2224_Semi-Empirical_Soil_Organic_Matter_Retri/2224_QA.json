The accuracy of the model, as indicated by these metrics, is quite high. The text states that the RMSEP is 0.18%, the R-2 value is 89.9%, and the RPD value is 3.2. These values suggest that the model has a high prediction accuracy and good prediction ability."

        "Output": "The semi-empirical SOM retrieval model based on the Kubelka-Munk theory contributes to the development of a theoretical basis, strong applicability, and higher accuracy in retrieving soil organic matter (SOM) content compared to previous models in the following ways:\n\n1. Theoretical Basis: The model is derived based on the Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory, which provides a solid theoretical foundation. This theory describes the relationship between the absorption coefficient (k) and scattering coefficient (s) of a material, and their relationship with SOM content (r = k/s). By incorporating this theory, the model establishes a clear link between the optical properties of soil and SOM content.\n\n2. Strong Applicability: The model is designed to have a wide range of applicability. It is tested and validated using a validation set consisting of three different sorts of soils. This demonstrates that the model can accurately estimate SOM content in various soil types, indicating its strong applicability across different agricultural settings.\n\n3. Higher Accuracy: The model achieves higher accuracy in retrieving SOM content compared to previous models. The results show that the model has a high prediction accuracy, with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of only 0.18%. Additionally, the coefficients of determination ("

        "Output": "The developed semi-empirical model for retrieving soil organic matter (SOM) content, based on the wavelength range of 552-950nm, is reported to have higher accuracy and stronger applicability compared to traditional methods.\n\nAccording to the text, the SOM retrieval models traditionally used are mainly established by statistical methods, which have limited application scope and incomplete theoretical foundation. In contrast, the newly constructed semi-empirical model has a certain theoretical basis, making it more reliable and applicable.\n\nThe accuracy of the SOM retrieval models is also improved with the new model. The validation set, consisting of three different types of soils, was used to confirm the validity and reliability of the model. The results showed that the model can estimate SOM content in different types of soils with high prediction accuracy. The root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP), coefficients of determination (R-2), and relative percentage deviation (RPD) values were reported to be 0.18%, 89.9%, and 3.2, respectively. These values indicate a high level of accuracy in predicting SOM content.\n\nTherefore, the developed semi-empirical model based on the wavelength range of 552-950nm surpasses traditional methods in terms of accuracy and applicability. It provides an innovative approach"
