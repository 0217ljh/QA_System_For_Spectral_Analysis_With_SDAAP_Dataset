        "instruction": "Can the proposed optical method supported by machine learning be used to discriminate urinary tract infections from an infection capable of causing urosepsis using spectroscopic methods?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed optical method supported by machine learning can be used to discriminate urinary tract infections from an infection capable of causing urosepsis using spectroscopic methods. The study shows that the method, which involves measuring spectra of artificial urine samples with bacteria from solid cultures of clinical E. coli strains, can provide reliable classification results with up to 97% accuracy. The method was validated on urine samples from 241 patients, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between different types of infections. Additionally, the advantages of this method include the simplicity of the sensor, mobility, versatility, and low cost of the test."
