        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the detection accuracy in the past study was the concentration of the virus in the sample, measured in micrograms per milliliter (\u6e2dg/mL) of protein using the Lowry protein assay. The past study found that the minimum detectable concentration of the virus using the proposed approach was approximately 0.05 \u6e2dg/mL of protein. The detection accuracy for a sample with this pathogen concentration was reported to be 84%."

        "Output": "Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) combined with machine learning technology can be considered a superior method for detecting and differentiating influenza type A and B viruses in a buffer environment compared to traditional methods. The past study states that the proposed approach using SERS and machine learning achieved an accuracy of 93% in differentiating samples containing influenza A and B viruses. Additionally, the minimum detectable concentration of the virus using this approach was similar to 0.05 \u6e2dg/mL of protein, and the detection accuracy at this concentration was 84%. These results suggest that SERS combined with machine learning technology offers a high level of accuracy and sensitivity in detecting and differentiating influenza viruses compared to traditional methods."
