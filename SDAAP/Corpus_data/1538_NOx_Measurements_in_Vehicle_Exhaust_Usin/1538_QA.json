        "Output": "The advantage of using extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms in the deep learning network for regressing NOx concentrations is that ELM algorithms have an exceptionally fast learning speed when dealing with big data problems. This means that the ELM algorithms can quickly process and analyze large amounts of data related to NOx concentrations in vehicle exhaust. Additionally, ELM algorithms have excellent generalization abilities, which means that they can accurately predict NOx concentrations based on the data they have learned, even when presented with new or unseen data. Overall, the use of ELM algorithms in the deep learning network improves the efficiency and accuracy of regressing NOx concentrations in vehicle exhaust."
