        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional techniques for rapid and reliable intraoperative diagnostic classification of gynecological tumors into malignant and benign groups. The study showed that FTIR spectroscopy, combined with digital dehydration and principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) models, accurately classified the tissue samples with high accuracies of 96% and 93% for the k-fold and leave one out validation schemes, respectively. The FTIR spectra collected from fresh tissue samples provided consistent and distinct differences between the fingerprint spectral region of malignant and benign tumors. This suggests that FTIR spectroscopy has the potential to be used as an adjunct to the intraoperative frozen section histopathology technique, providing a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for tumor classification."
