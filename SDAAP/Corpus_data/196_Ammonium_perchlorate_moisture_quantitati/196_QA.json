        "Output": "The researchers optimized the prediction models for measuring AP moisture content by using a genetic algorithm and extreme learning machine model. They used terahertz time domain spectroscopy to measure the optical parameters of aqueous AP samples. Then, they combined these measurements with chemometrics to construct five quantitative prediction models. Among these models, the absorption coefficient based genetic algorithm optimized extreme learning machine model yielded the best prediction results. This method allowed for accurate prediction of moisture content below 0.1%, with an absolute error of less than 0.001%. Additionally, the prediction error of the external verification model for different groups of samples was less than 0.06%. By utilizing this approach, the researchers were able to provide a reliable basis for rapid, accurate, and non-destructive detection of the moisture content of ammonium perchlorate and similar substances."
