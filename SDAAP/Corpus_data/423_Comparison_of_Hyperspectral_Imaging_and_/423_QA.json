        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in this study was the spectral reflectance of the samples. The study used partial least square regression (PLSR) models to correlate the spectral reflectance with carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations. The metric of R-2 (coefficient of determination) was used to assess the accuracy of the predictions.\n\nThe results showed that the most important spectral region for predicting C concentrations was 400-550 nm, with an R-2 value of 0.93 in the calibration set and an R-2 value of 0.86 in the test set. The root mean square error (RMSE) for C prediction in the test set was 0.21%. \n\nFor predicting N concentrations, the most important spectral regions were identified as 1451-1600 nm, 1901-2050 nm, and 2051-2200 nm. These regions provided prediction with R-2 values ranging from 0.91 to 0.93 in the calibration sets and an R-2 value ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 in the test sets. The RMSE for N prediction in the test sets was 0.06%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the past study, partial least square regression (PLSR) models were used to correlate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations of the Australian wheat samples with their spectral reflectance. The PLSR models were developed using 63 calibration samples, where the C and N concentrations were known, along with their corresponding spectral reflectance data obtained from hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). \n\nThe PLSR models were trained to establish the relationship between the spectral reflectance data and the C and N concentrations. Once the models were trained, they were tested using an additional 6 samples to evaluate their predictive performance. The accuracy of the predictions was assessed by comparing the predicted C and N concentrations from the models with the actual concentrations of the test samples.\n\nThe performance of the models was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-c^2), root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). The R-c^2 values indicate the proportion of the variance in the C and N concentrations that can be explained by the spectral reflectance data. The RMSE values represent the average difference between the predicted and actual concentrations, with lower values indicating higher accuracy. The RPD values provide a measure of the"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can be considered a superior spectroscopic method compared to near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for quality measurements of ground samples of Australian wheat. The accuracy of the HSI predictions for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations were similar or slightly higher than those of NIRS. The most important spectral region for C prediction identified using HSI reflectance was 400-550 nm, while the most important spectral regions for predicting N concentrations included 1451-1600 nm, 1901-2050 nm, and 2051-2200 nm. HSI also provided the advantage of visualizing the variability of C and N in the samples. Therefore, HSI is considered a multifunctional tool with potential applications in data collection and quality assurance within feed mills and poultry processing plants."
