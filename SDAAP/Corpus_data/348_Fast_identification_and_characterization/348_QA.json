These samples were used to train and test a hybrid model, which consisted of a data pretreatment module, a classification module, and a regression module.\n\nThe researchers explored the impacts of different machine learning model categories and parameters on the accuracy of predicting the elemental composition and heating value of RW. They likely experimented with various types of machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, or neural networks, to determine which model category performed the best.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers likely varied the parameters within each machine learning model category to find the optimal conditions for accurate predictions. These parameters could include the number of decision trees in a random forest, the kernel function in a support vector machine, or the number of hidden layers in a neural network.\n\nBy investigating and discussing different machine learning model categories and parameters, the researchers aimed to identify the most effective approach for distinguishing inorganic components and characterizing organic compounds in RW using LIBS."
