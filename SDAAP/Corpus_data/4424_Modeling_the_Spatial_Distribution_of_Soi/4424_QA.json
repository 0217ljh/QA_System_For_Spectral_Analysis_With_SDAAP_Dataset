        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms in mapping soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the nitrogen content that can be explained by the model, with a higher value indicating a better fit. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual nitrogen content values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy. \n\nThe study found that the random forest (RF) model had an R-2 value of 0.90 and an RMSE of 0.0076%, indicating a slightly better performance compared to the gradient boosting (GB) model with an R-2 value of 0.88 and an RMSE of 0.0083%, and the extreme gradient boosting (XG) model with an R-2 value of 0.89 and an RMSE of 0.0077%. \n\nBased on these metrics, the RF model was considered to have the highest accuracy in mapping soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms."
