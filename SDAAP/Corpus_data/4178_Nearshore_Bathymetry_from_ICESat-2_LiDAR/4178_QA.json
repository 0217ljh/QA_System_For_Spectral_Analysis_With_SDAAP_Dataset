        "Output": "The different methods used to evaluate the performance of the proposed deep learning framework for nearshore bathymetry using ICESat-2 LiDAR and Sentinel-2 Imagery datasets are:\n\n1. Empirical Method: This method involves comparing the bathymetric maps generated by the deep learning framework with those obtained through empirical models. The accuracy of the deep learning framework is assessed by measuring the difference between the predicted bathymetry and the bathymetry estimated using the empirical model.\n\n2. Machine Learning Method: In this method, the performance of the deep learning framework is compared with other machine learning algorithms. The bathymetric maps generated by the deep learning framework are compared with those produced by other machine learning methods to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n\n3. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): MLP is a type of artificial neural network commonly used in machine learning. The performance of the deep learning framework is evaluated by comparing its bathymetric maps with those generated using MLP. This comparison helps assess the superiority of the deep learning framework in terms of accuracy and precision."
