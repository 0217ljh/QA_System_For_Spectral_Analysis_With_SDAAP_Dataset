        "input": "",
        "Output": "The newly proposed BPSO-SVR method performed well in predicting nitrogen concentration of the rice canopy at different growth stages. The method yielded excellent R-2 values ranging from 0.913 to 0.949, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual nitrogen concentrations. Additionally, the method achieved smaller RMSE values ranging from 0.055 to 0.127, indicating a small average difference between the predicted and actual nitrogen concentrations. These results suggest that the BPSO-SVR method is effective in accurately estimating the nitrogen content of the rice canopy during different growth stages."
