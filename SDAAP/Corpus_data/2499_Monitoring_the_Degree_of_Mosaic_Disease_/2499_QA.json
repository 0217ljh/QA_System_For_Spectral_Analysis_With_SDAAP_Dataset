        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate the degree of apple mosaic disease in the related research is the content of anthocyanin in the apple leaves. The researchers used hyperspectral imaging technology to obtain spectral differences between healthy and infected leaves, and simultaneously measured the anthocyanin content. They developed an optimal model to estimate the anthocyanin content and determine the degree of apple mosaic disease.\n\nIn terms of the research, the metric of anthocyanin content was found to be effective in monitoring the degree of apple mosaic disease. The researchers observed that as the degree of disease increased, the infected leaves exhibited stronger reflectance at a range of 500-560 nm. By analyzing the spectral reflectance processed by the Gaussian1 wavelet transform, the correlation between the reflectance and anthocyanin content was significantly improved compared to the original spectrum.\n\nThe VPs-XGBoost anthocyanin estimation model performed the best in estimating the anthocyanin content and monitoring the degree of the disease. This suggests that the chosen metric of anthocyanin content, along with the remote sensing technology used, can provide a quantitative estimation of leaf anthocyanin content and effectively monitor the degree of apple mosaic disease."

Hyperspectral images of healthy and infected apple leaves were obtained using a near-ground imaging high spectrometer. The anthocyanin content in the leaves was measured simultaneously. The spectral differences between the healthy and infected leaves were analyzed. \n\nThe researchers processed the spectral reflectance using the Gaussian1 wavelet transform and compared the correlation between the processed spectrum and anthocyanin content with the original spectrum. They found that the correlation was significantly improved with the processed spectrum. \n\nThe VPs-XGBoost anthocyanin estimation model performed the best among the models tested. It was able to estimate the anthocyanin content in the leaves and monitor the degree of apple mosaic disease. This model provided the researchers with a quantitative estimation of leaf anthocyanin content by remote sensing, which could be used for large-scale monitoring of the disease."
