        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy of the identified calcareous formations was the overall accuracy (OA). The OA provides a measure of the percentage of correctly classified pixels in relation to the total number of pixels in the study area. In this case, the OA was reported to be 68.04% initially."
