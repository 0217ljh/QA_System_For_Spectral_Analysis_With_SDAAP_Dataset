        "Output": "In the experiment on sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) concentration inversion, the extreme learning machine (ELM) and genetic algorithm (GA) were utilized in the following ways:\n\n1. ELM Application: The ELM was applied to the SF6 concentration inversion research as an alternative to traditional neural networks. This was done to overcome the general disadvantages of traditional neural networks, such as slow training speed, sensitive learning rate selection, unstable solutions, weak generalization ability, and susceptibility to falling into local minimum points.\n\n2. Genetic Algorithm for Spectral Data Selection: To address the problems of high dimensionality, collinearity, and noise in the spectral data input to the ELM network, a genetic algorithm was used. The genetic algorithm was employed to obtain fewer but critical spectral data, which were then used as input variables for the ELM network.\n\n3. Comparison with GA-BP Neural Network: The performance of the genetic algorithm joint extreme learning machine (GA-ELM) was compared with the genetic algorithm joint backpropagation (GA-BP) neural network algorithm. This comparison aimed to verify the effectiveness of the GA-ELM approach in solving the SF6 concentration inversion problem."
