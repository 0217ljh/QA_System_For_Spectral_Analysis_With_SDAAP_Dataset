        "Output": "In the proposed method, the machine learning algorithms, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were utilized for material identification using the hyperspectral X-ray CT system. After wavelet denoising and principal component analysis (PCA) preprocessing, the X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) corresponding to the 360 pixel points in the tomography images were reconstructed. These reconstructed XAS data were then used as input features for the machine learning algorithms. \n\nThe ANN and SVM algorithms were trained using the reconstructed XAS data from the samples containing 10 kinds of plastic components. The training process involved feeding the input features (XAS data) to the algorithms along with their corresponding known material labels. The algorithms learned the patterns and relationships between the input features and the material labels during the training phase.\n\nOnce the ANN and SVM models were trained, they were used to classify the material composition in a region of interest (ROI) during nondestructive testing (NDT). The models were applied to the reconstructed XAS data from the ROI, and based on the learned patterns, they predicted the material labels for the ROI. The accuracy of the material identification in the ROI was evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation, and the highest accuracy achieved was 80.00%."
