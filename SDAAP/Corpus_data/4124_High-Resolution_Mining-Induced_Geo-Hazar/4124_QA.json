        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the RF-based MGM model can be used to improve the accuracy and resolution of mining-induced geo-hazard mapping (MGM) by incorporating changes in environmental factors in high susceptibility areas as indicators for monitoring and early-warning of geo-disaster occurrence. The model showed excellent prediction performance, with a high overall accuracy (98.53%), Kappa coefficient (97.06%), and AUC (0.998). Additionally, 85.60% of the observed geo-disasters occurred in the predicted high susceptibility class, which accounted for 2.82% of the study area. This suggests that the changes in environmental factors in these high susceptibility areas can be used as indicators for monitoring and early-warning of geo-disaster occurrence. By integrating detailed geological exploration, topographic survey data, satellite imagery, and machine learning techniques, the RF-based MGM model provides a comprehensive approach to improve the accuracy and resolution of MGM."
