        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in detecting phenol is the mean absolute error (MAE). The MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted phenol concentrations and the actual phenol concentrations in the natural surface waters. The paper states that the deep CNNs achieved mean absolute errors of 1.78 - 1.81 mg/L and 4.68-5.41 \u6e2dg/L for phenol, respectively. Therefore, the accuracy of the deep CNNs in detecting phenol concentrations can be within this range."

        "Output": "Machine learning algorithms were applied in the investigation of fluorescence techniques to improve the detection accuracy of naphthenic acids (NAs) and phenol in natural waters by identifying relevant spectral features. The algorithms, specifically deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), were used to analyze the fluorescence spectra associated with NAs and phenol signals. By training the deep CNNs on a dataset of fluorescence data, the algorithms were able to learn and identify logical areas of the spectra that corresponded to the presence of NAs and phenol. This allowed for optimized performance in detecting phenol, with mean absolute errors of 1.78 - 1.81 mg/L and 4.68-5.41 \u6e2dg/L, respectively. The results suggest that machine learning approaches can accurately predict the individual toxic components of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) in natural waters at environmentally relevant concentrations."

Machine learning approaches were applied to improve detection accuracy in the presence of background interference from organic matter in natural waters. The results showed that spectroscopic methods, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), were able to accurately and rapidly detect NAs and phenol in OSPW at environmentally relevant concentrations. Therefore, spectroscopic methods, combined with machine learning approaches, can be considered superior to traditional methods in accurately and rapidly quantifying levels of toxic compounds in OSPW."
