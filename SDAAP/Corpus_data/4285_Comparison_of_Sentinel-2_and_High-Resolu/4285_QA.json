        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of airborne imagery and spectral indices such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Thiam's Transformed Vegetation Index (TTVI) can be considered superior to traditional methods for mapping abandoned plots in the Valencian Region of Spain. The study compared three models for mapping abandoned plots using different types of imagery and spectral indices. The most accurate map was obtained using airborne imagery and the EVI and TTVI spectral indices, with an overall accuracy of 88.5%. This indicates that the combination of airborne imagery and these spectral indices provides more accurate results compared to traditional methods."
