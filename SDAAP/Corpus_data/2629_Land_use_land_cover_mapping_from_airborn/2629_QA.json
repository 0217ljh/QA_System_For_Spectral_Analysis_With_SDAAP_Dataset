        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed framework incorporates spatial information with spectral information in the classification of high resolution hyperspectral images by utilizing feature extraction methods such as Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gabor, and Morphological Attribute Profile (MAP) on a dimensionally reduced image. These feature extraction methods extract texture information from the image, which provides spatial information about the objects and their surroundings. By incorporating these texture features with the spectral information, the framework aims to improve the classification accuracy of land use/cover mapping applications."

According to the results, the overall classification accuracy was increased by up to 9% when using this framework. Additionally, the classification accuracies of individual classes, such as soil, road, vegetation, building, and shadow, were also improved by using Gabor features. The framework also showed an increase in accuracy when object-based classification was conducted. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed framework is effective in improving the classification accuracy of land use/cover mapping using high resolution hyperspectral image data."
