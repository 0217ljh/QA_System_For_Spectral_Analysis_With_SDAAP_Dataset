        "input": "",
        "Output": "The related study investigated the impact of wood surface roughness on the prediction accuracy of timber properties using infrared spectroscopy by conducting experiments on Douglas-fir and Western hemlock specimens with both rough and smooth surfaces. Infrared spectroscopy data were collected in the visible infrared (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and combined VIS and NIR range. The acquired data were then processed using principal component analysis (PCA) for data reduction and feature selection. The output of PCA was fed into different machine learning models, including an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN), and partial least square (PLS) regression model. The results showed that the wood surface finish, range of infrared data, and the type of machine learning model all had an impact on the prediction accuracy. It was found that NIR data acquired from rough surfaces resulted in better prediction accuracy, suggesting that an infrared spectroscopy test should be performed prior to surface planing."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The related study found that using infrared spectroscopy is a rapid and reliable non-destructive method for predicting the density, moduli of elasticity (MOE), and rupture (MOR) of structural softwoods. The traditional methods of predicting these properties were not mentioned in the related work, so it is not possible to directly compare the use of infrared spectroscopy to traditional methods based on the information provided. However, the related study did compare the predictive accuracy of different machine learning models using infrared spectroscopy data. The results showed that the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) outperformed the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN) and partial least square (PLS) regression models in predicting the properties of the softwoods. Therefore, it can be inferred that using infrared spectroscopy with ANFIS as the predictive model is a more accurate method compared to traditional methods for predicting the density, MOE, and MOR of structural softwoods."
