        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, hyperspectral remote sensing can be used to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado). The study investigated the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing to estimate AGB in the Cerrado, which is the second-largest source of carbon emissions in Brazil. The researchers collected a Hyperion/Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) image in the dry season at the Ecological Station of Aguas Emendadas (ESAE) and evaluated the performance of five machine learning models and four sets of metrics to estimate AGB. The results showed that the Random Forest (RF) model using narrowband vegetation indices (VIs) and a combination of metrics had the lowest root mean square error (RMSE). The RF model with VIs also had the most stable predictive performance across the models. The study concluded that these results provide a baseline for AGB modeling in savannas using hyperspectral remote sensing, which can be applied in future large-coverage hyperspectral satellite missions."
