        "instruction": "What kinds of spectrum was used in the related study to predict soil properties from raw soil spectra?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study used soil spectral data, specifically raw soil spectra, to develop and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting soil properties. The soil spectral data was represented as a 2-dimensional spectrogram, showing the reflectance as a function of wavelength and frequency."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the CNN model was significantly better compared to PLS regression and Cubist regression tree in predicting soil properties from raw soil spectra. In particular, the multi-task CNN model outperformed the other methods. For example, in the case of soil organic carbon prediction, the multi-task CNN decreased the error by 87% compared to PLS regression and 62% compared to Cubist regression tree. This suggests that the CNN model is more accurate and effective in modeling soil spectral data."

        "Output": "The performance of the CNN model was found to be significantly better than PLS regression and Cubist regression tree in predicting soil properties from raw soil spectra. In particular, the multi-task CNN model showed the highest accuracy. \n\nIn the case of soil organic carbon prediction, the multi-task CNN model reduced the error by 87% compared to PLS regression and 62% compared to Cubist regression tree. This indicates that the CNN model outperformed the traditional methods in accurately predicting soil properties.\n\nBased on these results, the spectrum method using CNN can be considered superior to the traditional methods of PLS regression and Cubist regression tree in modeling soil spectral data. The high accuracy of the CNN model makes it an ideal tool for predicting soil properties from raw soil spectra."
