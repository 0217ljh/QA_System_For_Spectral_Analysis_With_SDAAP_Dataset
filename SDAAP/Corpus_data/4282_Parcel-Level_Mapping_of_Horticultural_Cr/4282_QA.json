        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, two machine learning models were utilized to address the challenge of cloudy weather affecting phenological characteristics in orchard classification. \n\nFirstly, the RCF (Region Convolutional Features) and DABNet (Deep Attention-Based Network) models were used to extract candidate parcels from Very High-Resolution (VHR) images with a spatial resolution of 0.55 m. These models were employed to identify and delineate the boundaries of orchard parcels in the study area. The effectiveness of the parcel extraction method was evaluated using the F1 score and area-based intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics.\n\nSecondly, a two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was employed for classification based on an irregular time series constructed using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), and SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) vegetation indexes calculated from Sentinel-2 data. This model was trained to classify the orchard crops based on the spectral features captured by the irregular time series.\n\nBy utilizing these machine learning models, the study aimed to overcome the limitations posed by cloudy weather in capturing key phenological characteristics for orchard classification."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The method based on irregular time series outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and effectiveness for orchard classification in complex mountain areas. The overall accuracy of the method based on irregular time series is 97.76%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.96, which is higher than the other experiments using regular time series. This indicates that the classification method based on irregular time series is effective and can make full use of the fragmented spectral features. Therefore, the method based on irregular time series provides more accurate and reliable results for orchard classification in complex mountain areas compared to traditional methods."
