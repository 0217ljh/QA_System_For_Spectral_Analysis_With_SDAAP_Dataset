        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the classification models in differentiating Quaternary sediments was the Kappa analysis. The Kappa analysis showed that the agreement with the map of Quaternary deposits for the CART+ model was 0.5, while for the DA+ model it was 0.44. This indicates that the CART+ model performed slightly better in differentiating Quaternary sediments compared to the DA+ model."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Morphometric indicators were incorporated into the classification models by adding two variables: absolute height and topographic position index. These variables were included in addition to the spectral variables (principal components and spectral indices) in both the discriminant analysis (DA+) and classification and regression trees (CART+) models. By including these morphometric indicators, the classification of Quaternary sediments became more accurate, improving the identification of different types of deposits based on the spectral data and digital elevation model data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the nonparametric CART method can be considered superior to traditional methods in accurately differentiating loose deposits based on spectral data of vegetation cover and digital elevation model data, as demonstrated in the related study. The study compared two classification methods, discriminant analysis (DA) and classification and regression trees (CARTs), and found that the nonparametric CART method was more accurate in differentiating loose deposits. The CART+ model, which included spectral variables, absolute height, and topographic position index, achieved a correctness rate of 90.5% for the reference sample of observation points. In contrast, the DA+ model achieved a correctness rate of 44%. Additionally, the Kappa analysis showed a higher agreement with the map of Quaternary deposits for the CART+ model (0.5) compared to the DA+ model (0.44). Therefore, based on the results of this study, the nonparametric CART method can be considered superior in accurately differentiating loose deposits."
