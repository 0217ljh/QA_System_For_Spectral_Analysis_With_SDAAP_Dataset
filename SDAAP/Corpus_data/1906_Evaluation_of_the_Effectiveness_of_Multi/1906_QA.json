        "Output": "The random forest based on genetic algorithm optimization (GA_RF) model is much more accurate than the linear model in retrieving TSM concentration. The GA_RF model has a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.98, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.715 mg/L, and an average relative error (ARE) of 6.83%. These values indicate a high level of prediction accuracy. In contrast, the linear model does not provide specific accuracy values in the given text. However, it is stated that the machine learning models, including GA_RF, are much more accurate than the linear model."
