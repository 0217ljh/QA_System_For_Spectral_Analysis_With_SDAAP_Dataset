        "Output": "Yes. The developed DM mango maturity method, which achieved 88.2% accuracy in predicting the maturity state of mangoes, can be considered superior to traditional methods of maturity estimation. The test results showed that the maximum accuracy achieved using traditional methods with hard thresholds was only 55.9%. Therefore, the developed method outperformed the traditional methods in accurately classifying the maturity state of mangoes."
