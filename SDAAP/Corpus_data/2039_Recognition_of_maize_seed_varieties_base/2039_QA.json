        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the recognition model in the study was precision. Precision measures the proportion of correctly identified maize seed varieties out of the total number of varieties identified.\n\nThe precision of the recognition model increased from 0.9333 to 0.9556 when using the random subspace ensemble learning (RSEL) model with the MSC-IRIV preprocessing and dimensionality reduction methods. This indicates an improvement in the accuracy of identifying maize seed varieties.\n\nAdditionally, the Kappa coefficient increased from 0.9174 to 0.9457 when using the MSC-IRIV-RSEL model. The Kappa coefficient measures the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance. The increase in the Kappa coefficient suggests a higher level of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications of maize seed varieties.\n\nOverall, the chosen metric of precision, along with the Kappa coefficient, demonstrates the improved performance of the recognition model in accurately identifying maize seed varieties."
