        "Output": "The results of the classification performance using sensors with lower spectral and spatial resolution in permanent grassland showed that a cross-validated mean accuracy of 86.1% was achieved when using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with all 191 available predictors (spectral bands). When using only 48 high-performing predictors, an accuracy of 80% could still be achieved. The spectral regions of 954 nm to 956 nm, 684 nm to 744 nm, and 442 nm to 444 nm were found to contribute the most to the classification performance. These findings suggest that it is possible to achieve accurate grassland classification using sensors with reduced spectral and spatial resolution, which could potentially reduce data processing requirements and costs."

These spectral regions were found to contribute the most to the classification performance, indicating their importance in accurately classifying different species groups and plant parts in grassland."
