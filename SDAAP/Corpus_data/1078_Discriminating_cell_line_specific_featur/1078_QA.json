        "Output": "To effectively utilize the complete spectral information in discriminating between Raman spectra of the 11 bacterial mutants of Escherichia coli MDS42 using the artificial neural network and support vector machine models, several steps can be taken:\n\n1. Understanding distinct information gained: It is important to have a better understanding of the distinct information gained from each model. This can be achieved by analyzing the strain-specific and function-specific spectral features utilized by each model. By identifying the specific peaks and intensity levels that are utilized by each model, a clearer picture of the discriminatory capabilities of each model can be obtained.\n\n2. Feature selection: Based on the analysis of strain-specific and function-specific spectral features, a subset of features that contribute significantly to the discrimination can be selected. This can involve identifying the high intensity peaks that are utilized by both models, as well as the lower intensity peaks that are utilized by only one model or the other. By focusing on these informative features, the discriminatory power of the models can be enhanced.\n\n3. Model optimization: Once the informative features have been identified, the models can be optimized to make better use of the complete spectral information. This can involve adjusting the model parameters, such as the regularization parameter in the support vector machine or the number of hidden layers and neurons in the"
