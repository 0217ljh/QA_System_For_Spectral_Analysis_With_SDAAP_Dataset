        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the method in the past study was the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. This analysis measures the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate at various classification thresholds. The accuracy of the method, as indicated by the ROC curve analysis, was reported to be 100% at the donor level during external validation."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Raman spectroscopy with machine learning shows promise as a potential alternative method for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest stages. The past study successfully used Raman spectroscopy to analyze blood serum samples from rats fed either a standard diet or a high-fat diet, which is known to initiate a pre-AD state. The combination of partial least squares discriminant analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was able to accurately separate the two rat groups with 100% accuracy during external validation."
