        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the developed CNN is the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted DSR values and the actual DSR values at the 34 baseline surface radiation network sites globally during 2013. \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the RMSE value obtained from the validation results was 91.42 W/m2. This indicates that, on average, the predicted DSR values from the developed CNN had a difference of 91.42 W/m2 compared to the actual DSR values. \n\nTherefore, the RMSE metric provides a measure of the accuracy of the developed CNN in estimating DSR, with a value of 91.42 W/m2 in the related particular study."

In comparison, the previous LUT and optimization-based algorithms had higher errors, with the proposed algorithm outperforming them by around 10-20 W/m2. \n\nThis indicates that the deep learning method, which takes advantage of both spectral information and vertical information, provides more accurate estimations of DSR from satellite observations compared to traditional methods."
