        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models in the related study is the coefficient of determination (R-squared or R^2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. \n\nThe R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model to the data. In the related study, the R-v(2) and R-p(2) values were used to evaluate the calibration and prediction performance, respectively, of the models.\n\nThe R-v(2) and R-p(2) values obtained by the different models (PLSR, SVR, and 1DCNN) were compared to assess their performance. The results showed that the 1DCNN model had higher R-v(2) and R-p(2) values compared to the other models, indicating a better fit and predictive ability.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of R-squared provides a measure of how well the models can explain and predict the variation in the data. The higher the R-squared value, the better the model's performance in regression analysis."

        "Output": "The related study compared the performance of the 1DCNN algorithm with support vector machine regression (SVR) and partial least-square regression (PLSR) methods in analyzing Antai pills spectral data by evaluating various indices. These indices included the correction coefficient of determination (R-v(2)), the root mean-squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) for calibration set, the prediction coefficient of determination (R-p(2)), and the root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSEP). The results showed that the 1DCNN model outperformed the PLSR and SVR models with similar data preprocessing for the three analytes (wogonoside, scutellarin, and ferulic acid) in Antai pills. The evaluation metrics of 1DCNN were better than those of PLSR and SVR, indicating that the 1DCNN algorithm had a good generalization ability and provided the best prediction effect."

        "Output": "The related study suggests that the 1DCNN model outperforms traditional chemometric methods, such as support vector machine regression (SVR) and partial least-square regression (PLSR), in analyzing Antai pills spectral data. The 1DCNN model showed better performance in terms of evaluation metrics such as the correction coefficient of determination (R-v(2)), the root mean-squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) for calibration set, the prediction coefficient of determination (R-p(2)), and the root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSEP). The indices obtained by the 1DCNN model were higher for R-v(2) and R-p(2), indicating better accuracy, and lower for RMSECV and RMSEP, indicating lower error, compared to the PLSR and SVR models. The related study concludes that the 1DCNN model has a good generalization ability and performs the best in regression analysis of Antai pills spectral data."
