        "Output": "The researchers compared the performance of their proposed model that integrates spectral and spatial location features for water bathymetry using remote sensing images with three other models by measuring the mean relative error and the root mean square error. They found that the proposed model had a mean relative error of only 8.41, and the root mean square error was reduced by 34-68 when compared with the three other models. This indicates that the proposed model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy and precision in estimating water depths."
