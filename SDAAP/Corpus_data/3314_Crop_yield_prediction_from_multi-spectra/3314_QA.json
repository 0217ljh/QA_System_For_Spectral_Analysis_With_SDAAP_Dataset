The architecture aims to exploit spatial, spectral, and temporal information from multi-spectral and multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery.\n\nThe SSTNN architecture combines 3D convolutional and recurrent neural networks to leverage their complementarity. It incorporates a spatial-spectral learning module and a temporal dependency capturing module into a unified convolutional network. This allows the architecture to recognize the joint spatial-spectral-temporal representation of the crops.\n\nThe spatial-spectral learning module first extracts spatial-spectral features from the multi-spectral images. These features capture the diverse characteristics of the crops. Then, the temporal dependency capturing module is added on top of the spatial-spectral feature learning module. This module mines the temporal relationship from the long time-series images, capturing the changes in the crops over time.\n\nBy combining spatial, spectral, and temporal information, the SSTNN architecture aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing crop yield. This holistic approach allows for better prediction performance compared to other machine learning and deep learning methods."

        "Output": "The proposed SSTNN (Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Neural Network) method utilizes spatial, spectral, and temporal information to improve crop yield prediction compared to other competitive methods by combining 3D convolutional and recurrent neural networks. \n\nFirstly, the SSTNN incorporates a spatial-spectral learning module, which extracts spatial-spectral features from the multi-spectral images. This module allows for the exploration of heterogeneous features by capturing the fixed spectral information from remote sensing images.\n\nSecondly, the SSTNN includes a temporal dependency capturing module, which is concatenated on top of the spatial-spectral feature learning module. This module mines the temporal relationship from long time-series images, enabling the model to capture the dynamic changes in crop growth over time.\n\nBy combining these modules into a unified convolutional network, the SSTNN is able to recognize the joint spatial-spectral-temporal representation of crop growth. This comprehensive approach allows for a more holistic understanding of the complex traits that determine crop yield.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed SSTNN introduces a new loss function that addresses the issue of an imbalanced distribution of crop yield labels. This loss function helps to eliminate the influence of this imbalance and improves the prediction performance of the model."
