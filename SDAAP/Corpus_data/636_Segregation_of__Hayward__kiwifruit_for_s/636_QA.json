        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the storage potential of kiwifruit in the related research that utilized Vis-NIR spectroscopy was the export FF criterion of 9.8 N. This criterion was used to segregate the storability of kiwifruit into two groups: short storability (soft fruit) and long storability (good fruit). The related research found that the best prediction of storage potential was achieved for fruit stored at 0 degrees C for 125 days, where approximately 54% of the soft fruit and 79% of the good fruit could be accurately predicted."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning classification models were developed using the Vis-NIR spectral data obtained at harvest. These models were used to segregate the kiwifruit into two groups based on the export FF criterion of 9.8 N, which is a measure of fruit firmness. The models were trained to classify the fruit into either the \"short storability\" group (soft fruit) or the \"long storability\" group (good fruit). By utilizing these models, the researchers were able to predict the storage potential of individual or batches of kiwifruit at harvest."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The use of visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy at harvest can be considered superior to traditional methods in qualitatively forecasting the storage potential of individual or batches of kiwifruit, as investigated in the related study. The related study found that machine learning classification models developed using Vis-NIR spectral data were able to accurately segregate kiwifruit into two groups based on their storage potential. This method showed the best prediction for fruit stored at 0 degrees C for 125 days, with approximately 54% of the soft fruit and 79% of the good fruit being correctly predicted. The related study also validated the model using data from a new season, further demonstrating its robustness. Implementing this method in the industry could lead to significant cost savings by reducing fruit loss, repacking, and condition checking costs."
