        "input": "",
        "Output": "The accuracy of the parametric method for retrieving hyperspectral signature is comparable to traditional methods in estimating pasture biomass. The study found that both the simulated features derived from the retrieved hyperspectral data and the currently employed vegetation indices derived from the original band values had similar accuracies. The root mean square error (RMSE) for both methods was approximately 490 kg DM/ha in cross-validation and 620 kg DM/ha in spatial cross-validation. These results suggest that the parametric method is as accurate as traditional methods in estimating pasture biomass."
