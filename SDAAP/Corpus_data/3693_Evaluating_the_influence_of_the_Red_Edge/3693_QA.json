        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of LAI estimation in the study is the R-2 value, also known as the coefficient of determination. This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the LAI estimates that can be explained by the spectral information derived from the different bands. \n\nThe R-2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit between the estimated LAI values and the actual LAI values. Therefore, the higher the R-2 value, the more accurate the LAI estimation.\n\nIn the study, the R-2 values were used to compare the accuracy of LAI estimation using different spectral information. The study found that the inclusion of spectral information derived from the Red Edge band yielded higher R-2 values compared to the use of traditional RGBNIR spectral information. This indicates that the Red Edge band provided more accurate LAI estimates."

The results of the study demonstrated that the inclusion of spectral information derived from the Red Edge band (RE) yielded more accurate LAI estimates compared to the use of traditional RGBNIR spectral information. The integration of traditional RGBNIR + RE resulted in the most accurate LAI estimates, with higher R-2 values, lower Root Mean Squares, and Mean Absolute Error."
