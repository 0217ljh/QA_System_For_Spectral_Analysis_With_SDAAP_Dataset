        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the strong linear correlation between the NIR spectra captured at harvest and the future fungal severity of tomato sepals suggests that using NIR hyperspectral imaging and machine learning can be a superior alternative to traditional methods in predicting the susceptibility of recently harvested tomatoes to future fungal infections. This approach allows for early detection of vulnerable produce, enabling timely preventive actions and minimizing potential post-harvest losses. Additionally, it can aid in making informed business decisions such as adjusting storage conditions, dynamic pricing based on quality, and estimating shelf life."
