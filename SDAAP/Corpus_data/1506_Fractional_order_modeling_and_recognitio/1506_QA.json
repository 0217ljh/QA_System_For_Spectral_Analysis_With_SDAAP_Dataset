These models were applied to analyze the near-infrared (NIR) spectra of rubber tree foliage.\n\nTo improve the performance of the models, the spectra were processed using Grunwald-Letnikov fractional calculus. The study found that models constructed using 0.6-order or 1.6-order spectra achieved better performance compared to models using integer-order spectra.\n\nIn addition, the successive projections algorithm (SPA) was employed as a spectral feature reduction method. This algorithm helped to reduce the number of variables in the NIR spectra, which is crucial for developing portable nitrogen-level detector devices for rubber trees.\n\nAmong the models tested, the PLS-DA method achieved the best performance with an optimal recognition rate of 97.73% using the 1.6-order spectra. This suggests that the nitrogen content of rubber trees can be reliably estimated using fractional calculus processed NIR spectra."
