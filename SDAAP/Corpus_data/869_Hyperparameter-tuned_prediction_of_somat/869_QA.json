        "Output": "Yes. Based on the study's findings, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for distinguishing patients with somatic symptom disorder (SSD) from healthy controls. The study utilized fNIRS to perform two painful stimulation experiments and found that utilizing connections between specific cortical regions resulted in high specificity (85%), accuracy (82%), and sensitivity (81%) in classifying SSD patients and healthy controls. These findings suggest that fNIRS has the potential to be a robust biomarker for SSD neurobiology."
