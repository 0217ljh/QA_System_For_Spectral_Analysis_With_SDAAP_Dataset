The MSE was used to measure the prediction performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) model in predicting the water pH and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) values. The research found that the ANN model achieved a mean square error of 0.1466 for pH prediction and 0.3136 for TAN prediction. This metric indicates the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values, providing a measure of the accuracy of the predictions."

        "Output": "The combination of machine learning and NIR light, as described in the text, shows promising results in predicting the pH and TAN values of a fish farming system. Traditional methods for quantifying these water quality parameters require sample preparation and can be time-consuming. In contrast, the proposed system using machine learning and NIR light allows for rapid quality control without sample preparation.\n\nThe research conducted in the text used a multi-wavelength LED and a light sensing element to measure the transmitted NIR light of water samples. Conventional methods were then used to quantify the actual pH and TAN values of the samples. The measured NIR transmittance was correlated with the pH and TAN values using an artificial neural network (ANN) as the machine learning model.\n\nThe results of the study showed that the ANN with four hidden neurons achieved the best prediction performance. The mean square error (MSE) for pH prediction was 0.1466, and for TAN prediction, it was 0.3136. The correlation coefficient (R) for pH prediction was 0.8398, and for TAN prediction, it was 0.9560.\n\nThese results indicate that the combination of machine learning and NIR light can provide accurate predictions of pH and TAN values in a fish farming system.
