By using spectral analysis instruments and extracting spectral features through a convolutional neural network, the algorithm can quickly analyze the coal samples and provide results in a shorter time frame.\n\nSecondly, the extreme learning machine algorithm improves the accuracy of the coal analysis. By utilizing spectral data and extracting spectral features, the algorithm can capture more detailed and precise information about the coal components. This leads to more accurate predictions and analysis of the moisture, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon, sulphur contents, and heating value of the coal samples.\n\nLastly, the extreme learning machine algorithm enhances the financial efficiency of the coal analysis method. Traditional chemical analysis methods require expensive equipment and reagents, as well as skilled personnel to perform the analysis. In contrast, the extreme learning machine algorithm relies on spectral analysis instruments and computational techniques, which are generally more cost-effective.
