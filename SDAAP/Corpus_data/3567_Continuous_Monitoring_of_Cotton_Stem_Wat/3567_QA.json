        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the estimation models in this study is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the SWP that can be explained by the model, with a value closer to 1 indicating a better fit. The RMSE measures the average difference between the predicted and observed SWP values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy."
