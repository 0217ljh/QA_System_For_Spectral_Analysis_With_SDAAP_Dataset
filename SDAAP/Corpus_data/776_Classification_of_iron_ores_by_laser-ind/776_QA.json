        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related study, support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest (RF) machine learning methods were evaluated comparatively in their ability to predict unknown iron ore samples. Models were constructed from a predetermined training set using the chemical properties and compositions of the iron ore grades. The prediction accuracies of both SVM and RF models were found to be acceptable. However, RF exhibited better predictions of classification compared to SVM. This suggests that the RF machine learning method was more effective in accurately identifying and discriminating the ten iron ore grades using the LIBS-RF technique."

Compared to traditional methods, the LIBS-RF technique showed better predictions of classification. This suggests that LIBS-RF is a more accurate and reliable method for identifying and distinguishing different iron ore grades."
