        "Output": "The spectral feature processing method used to analyze the soil spectral data in the related study was continuous wavelet transformation. The original spectral reflectance of the soil was subjected to continuous wavelet transformation using four wavelet basis functions (biorl. 3, db4, gaus4, and mexh). This transformation helped improve the correlation between the spectral reflectance and soil heavy metal arsenic content, and selected sensitive wavelet coefficients were used as independent variables for further analysis."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The use of hyperspectral technology for estimating soil heavy metal arsenic content is more accurate and stable compared to traditional methods. According to the related study, hyperspectral technology has the characteristics of rapid, accurate, and low-cost estimation of soil heavy metal arsenic content. It can dynamically monitor heavy metal arsenic pollution in oasis soils in arid regions. \n\nThe related study also mentions that by using continuous wavelet transformation with selected sensitive wavelet coefficients, the correlation between the spectral reflectance and soil heavy metal arsenic is effectively improved. This indicates that hyperspectral technology can provide more accurate estimations of heavy metal arsenic content in soil.\n\nFurthermore, the related study compares the performance of different modeling methods, including partial least square regression (PLSR), support vector machine regression (SVMR), BP neural network (BPNN), and random forest regression (RFR). It concludes that the SVMR, BPNN, and RFR models have stronger estimation capabilities and higher accuracy compared to the PLSR model. The best estimation model identified in the study area is the biorl. 3-2(5)-RFR model, which demonstrates powerful stability and a better estimation effect."
