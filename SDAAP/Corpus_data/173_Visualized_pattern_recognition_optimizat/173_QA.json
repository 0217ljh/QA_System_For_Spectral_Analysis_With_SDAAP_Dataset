The spectral data collected from damaged and undamaged Red Fuji apples was pretreated using the Min-Max standardization algorithm. The data was then analyzed using these pattern recognition models. Additionally, neural network visualization was introduced to improve accuracy during the analysis using the BP neural networks. The BP neural networks achieved the highest accuracy of 94.74% among the models tested.

        "Output": "The proposed optimized multicount measurement classification recognition (MMCR) model outperforms traditional methods in terms of both accuracy and detection speed for nondestructive testing of mechanical damage in apples. The MMCR model achieved an accuracy of 97.5%, which is higher than the accuracy achieved by traditional methods. Additionally, the MMCR model offers ultrahigh detection speed, indicating that it can quickly and efficiently identify mechanical damage in apples. This is in contrast to traditional methods, which have limitations in detection efficiency and require significant human resources. Therefore, the MMCR model provides a significant improvement in both accuracy and detection speed compared to traditional methods."
