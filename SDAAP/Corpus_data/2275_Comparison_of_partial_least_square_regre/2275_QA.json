However, it does mention that the three techniques (PLSR, SVM, and DL) were used to establish a soil salinity model using soil salt indices (SSI) and the simulated Landsat bands as independent variables. The results indicate that PLSR with SSI performed the best for both simulated Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 data.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is not possible to determine how far the chosen metric can go in evaluating the performance of the techniques."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the PLSR model with SSI (Soil Salt Indices) in estimating soil salt content from Landsat data is better than traditional methods. The study found that PLSR with SSI performed the best for both simulated Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 data. Compared to other techniques such as support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning (DL), PLSR with SSI provided more accurate estimations of soil salt content. SVM underestimated the soil salt content, while DL obtained centralized simulations and failed to capture the lower and upper observations. Therefore, the study recommends using the PLSR model with SSI as independent variables (IV) for estimating soil salt content from Landsat data."
