        "Output": "Yes, the proposed method using K-nearest neighbours and spectral angle mapper algorithms can achieve better results in extracting terraces compared to traditional methods in hilly and gully regions on the Loess Plateau, China. The study found that the overall accuracy of the proposed method was 62.2% in K-nearest neighbours and 74.8% in spectral angle mapper methods. These results indicate the advantages of the proposed method, despite the use of much lower resolution data than previous studies that used both high-resolution terrain and remote sensing imageries data. Therefore, the proposed method using machine learning methods based on Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis shows promise in accurately extracting terraces in the hilly and gully regions on the Loess Plateau."
