        "Output": "In the research on distinguishing heavy metal pollution in crops using machine learning and hyperspectral remote sensing, the Naive Bayes algorithm was used in combination with spectral indexes. A method called SINB (Spectral Index and Naive Bayes) was proposed. \n\nFirst, the crop spectra were processed to construct three different spectral indexes: CLPIOR (Copper-Lead Pollution Index of the original spectrum), CLPICR (Copper-Lead Pollution Index of the continuum removed spectrum), and CLPIFOD (Copper-Lead Pollution Index of the first-order differential spectrum). These spectral indexes were derived from the processed crop spectra and served as input variables for the Naive Bayes algorithm.\n\nNext, the Naive Bayes algorithm was applied to discriminate between heavy metal pollution in crops. Discriminant functions were constructed using samples from the training group, and a discriminant rule was formulated based on these functions.\n\nFinally, the universality and robustness of the SINB method were tested using samples from the validation group. The results showed that the CLPIOR, CLPICR, and CLPIFOD spectral indexes were sensitive in distinguishing Copper (Cu) and Lead (Pb) pollution. The SINB method achieved a discrimination accuracy of 100% in both the training"

The method achieved a discrimination accuracy of 100% in both the training group and the validation group. The CLPIOR, CLPICR, and CLPIFOD spectral indexes were found to be sensitive in distinguishing Copper (Cu) and Lead (Pb) pollution.
