        "Output": "Yes, the combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be considered a superior method for discriminating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and control group compared to traditional methods. The past study found that utilizing information from both EEG and fNIRS improved the classification accuracy for ADHD diagnosis. The features obtained from fNIRS and EEG signals were analyzed, and machine learning techniques were applied to classify the subjects. The best classification accuracy was achieved using the combination of EEG and fNIRS signals, with an accuracy rate of 93.18%. This demonstrates that multimodal neuroimaging, combining signals from different brain modalities, has the potential to improve the accuracy of ADHD diagnosis compared to traditional methods."
