        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction models in the related study was the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error of prediction (RMSE), residual predictive deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). These metrics were used to assess the accuracy, precision, and stability of the models in predicting soil moisture content. \n\nThe results showed that the machine learning algorithms, specifically the extreme learning machine-based predicting model, performed the best in predicting soil moisture content. The extreme learning machine model achieved an R-2 value of 0.918, an RMSE of 0.015, an RPD of 3.123, and an RPIQ of 3.325. These values indicate a high level of accuracy, low prediction error, and good stability in estimating soil moisture content. Therefore, the chosen metric performed well in evaluating the prediction models, and the extreme learning machine-based model was the most effective in predicting soil moisture content."
