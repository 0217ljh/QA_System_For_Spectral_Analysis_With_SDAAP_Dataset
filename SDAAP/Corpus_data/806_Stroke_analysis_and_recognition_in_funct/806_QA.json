        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed automatic classification framework based on cerebral oxygen saturation signals can be used to distinguish patients with hemorrhagic stroke, patients with ischemic stroke, and normal subjects using spectroscopic methods. The framework utilizes functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor and detect the cerebral oxygen saturation and the relative value of oxygen and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in the left and right frontal lobes. By analyzing the differences in cerebral oxygen saturation signals among different types of stroke patients and healthy individuals, machine learning models are trained using wavelet time-frequency analysis-based features extracted from these signals. The accuracy of the trained models is reported to be greater than 85%, and after data augmentation, the accuracy exceeds 90%. This indicates that the framework is effective in distinguishing between patients with hemorrhagic stroke, patients with ischemic stroke, and normal subjects, and has the potential to shorten the onset-to-diagnosis time of stroke."
