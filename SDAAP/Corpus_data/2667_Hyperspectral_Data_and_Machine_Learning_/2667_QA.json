        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to estimate and monitor different parameters for water quality in inland waters is the coefficient of determination, also known as R-2. This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the regression model. \n\nThe coefficient of determination R-2 in this research ranged from 89.9% to 94.6%. This indicates that the machine learning approaches with hyperspectral data have a high level of accuracy in estimating and monitoring the different parameters for water quality in inland waters."

        "Output": "For water quality in inland waters,the authors evaluated the regression performance of each machine learning model and variable by using a coefficient of determination R-2. They calculated the R-2 value for each model and variable, which ranged from 89.9% to 94.6%. This allowed them to assess the performance of each model and variable in estimating and monitoring the different parameters for water quality in inland waters."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of hyperspectral data and machine learning methods can be used to estimate and monitor different parameters for water quality in inland waters, as proposed in this research. The research paper presents a regression framework involving ten machine learning models and two preprocessing methods to estimate parameters such as CDOM, chlorophyll a, turbidity, and the concentrations of diatoms and green algae. The best performing model for each variable achieved a coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 89.9% to 94.6%, indicating the potential of the machine learning approaches with hyperspectral data."
