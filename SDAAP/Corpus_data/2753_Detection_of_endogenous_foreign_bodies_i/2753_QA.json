        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed deep learning method using the 2D CNN-LSTM model can be considered superior to traditional methods in effectively differentiating the shells from the kernels of Chinese hickory nuts. The study showed that the 2D CNN-LSTM model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 99.0%, which indicates its high accuracy in distinguishing between the shells and kernels. This method outperformed the traditional classification methods, PCA-KNN and SVM, in terms of accuracy. By effectively differentiating the shells from the kernels, this deep learning method ensures consumer safety by reducing the risk of including harmful shell fragments in the final product."
