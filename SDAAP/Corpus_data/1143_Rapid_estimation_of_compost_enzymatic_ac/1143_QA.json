The RPD value obtained was 3.2, indicating a moderate level of prediction accuracy. However, it is important to note that the study does not provide information on how far this metric can go in predicting compost enzymatic activity."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of VisNIR DRS is better than the traditional FDA-HR assay in predicting compost enzymatic activity. The study found that the artificial neural network multilayer perceptron model, using VisNIR reflectance spectra after Savitzky-Golay first derivative pretreatment, outperformed other multivariate models. The residual prediction deviation was 3.2, validation r(2) was 0.91, and RMSE was 13.38 \u6e2dg g(-1)h(-1). This indicates that VisNIR DRS is a more efficient and accurate method for predicting compost enzymatic activity compared to the traditional FDA-HR assay."
