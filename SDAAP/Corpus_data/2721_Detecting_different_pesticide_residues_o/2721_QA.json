        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification results in the related study was the F1-score. The F1-score is a measure of a model's accuracy that takes into account both precision and recall. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance.\n\nThe F1-score can range from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better classification performance. In the related study, the F1-score value achieved using the proposed 1D-CNN model after information fusion was 0.9396, which indicates a high level of accuracy in detecting different pesticide residues on the surface of Hami melon."
