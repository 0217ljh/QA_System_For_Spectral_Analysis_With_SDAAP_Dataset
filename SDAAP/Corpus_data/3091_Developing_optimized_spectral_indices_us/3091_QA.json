        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning models, specifically the random forest algorithm, were used to compare the performance of the developed optimized indices with existing spectral indices in modeling Fusarium circinatum stress in Pinus radiata seedlings. The analyses were conducted within a multivariate framework, where the random forest algorithm was applied to both the developed optimized indices and the existing indices. The performance of the models was evaluated based on overall accuracy, which ranged from 76% to 96% for the optimized indices and from 83% to 90% for the existing indices. The results showed that the optimized indices achieved improved accuracies compared to the existing indices. Additionally, the results indicated that the multivariate approach, using the random forest algorithm, yielded superior results compared to the univariate approach. Therefore, the machine learning models were instrumental in demonstrating the operational potential of the developed optimized indices in modeling Fusarium circinatum stress in Pinus radiata seedlings."
