        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the CRC estimation models is the coefficient of determination (R-cv^2) and the root mean square error (RMSEcv). The R-cv^2 measures the proportion of the variance in the CRC estimates that can be explained by the predictors, with a value closer to 1 indicating a better fit. The RMSEcv measures the average difference between the predicted CRC values and the actual ground CRC values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy."

        "Output": "Yes, the machine learning approaches, particularly the Gaussian process regression (GPR) method, can be used to estimate crop residue cover (CRC) from Sentinel-2 imagery in a superior way compared to traditional methods. The study evaluated various empirical regression and machine learning algorithms for estimating CRC using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. The results showed that ML approaches, including GPR, achieved high accuracy in estimating CRC. The GPR model with a combination of crop residue indices (CRIs) and textural features performed the best, with an R-cv(2) of 0.69 and RMSEcv of 6.149%. This indicates that the GPR method, along with the combination of spectral information and textural features, provides a superior approach for estimating CRC from Sentinel-2 imagery compared to traditional methods."
