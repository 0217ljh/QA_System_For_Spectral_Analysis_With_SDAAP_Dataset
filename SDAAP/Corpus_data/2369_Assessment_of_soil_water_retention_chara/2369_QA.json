        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to create supervised classification models and regression models for soil water potential and soil water content was the spectral characteristics of the soils. The metric can accurately predict the levels of water availability for plants, especially under conditions of plant water stress above the pF2.7."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study found that classification models based solely on spectral data exhibited similar accuracy as those including physico-chemical soil properties for estimating soil water potential. This suggests that spectral data indirectly reflects soil properties related to water potential."
