        "Output": "Yes,based on the information provided in the text, the study demonstrated that the spectral features extracted from the NIRS data, including breathing interval, breathing depth, and O(2)Hb signal amplitude, can be used to distinguish between normal and simulated pathological breathing. The weighted average accuracy of using these features together was 0.87. Therefore, it can be inferred that the spectral features identified in this study using a wearable NIRS sensor can be considered as a potentially superior alternative to traditional methods for distinguishing between normal and simulated pathological breathing."
