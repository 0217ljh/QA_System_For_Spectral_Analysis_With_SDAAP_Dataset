        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, high-fidelity airborne imaging spectroscopy can accurately estimate beta-diversity and distance decay in lowland tropical forests, compared to traditional methods. The past study used this approach to quantify spatial turnover in species composition across three landscapes in Northern Peru. The researchers validated their approach by comparing the results with an independent dataset of forest composition in 49 forest census plots. They found a significant correlation between the similarity metrics derived from the spectral data and the forest plot data, suggesting that beta-diversity within and among forest types can be accurately estimated using airborne spectroscopic data. Additionally, the past study found that the estimated distance decay in species similarity varied among different forest types, indicating that the approach can capture variations in beta-diversity across landscapes."
