        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study validates Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy-based capsular typing of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a rapid, cost-effective, and medium-throughput alternative to classical phenotypic techniques by conducting several experiments. \n\nFirst, a training set of 233 strains, including all 24 vaccine types (VTs) and 10 non-vaccine types (NVTs), was defined. The acquired spectra from these strains were used to create a dendrogram, where strains clustered together according to their serotypes. This demonstrates that FT-IR spectroscopy can accurately differentiate between closely related bacterial strains.\n\nSecond, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was trained using the acquired spectra to predict unknown pneumococcal serotypes. During validation using 153 additional strains, the study achieved 98.0% accuracy in determining serotypes represented in the training set. This indicates that FT-IR spectroscopy can accurately classify pneumococcal serotypes.\n\nFurthermore, the performance of the IR Biotyper (FT-IR spectroscopy instrument) was assessed using 124 strains representing 59 non-training set serotypes. In this setting, 42 out of 59 serotypes (71.1%) could be accurately categorized as non-training set serotypes."
