        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the authenticity identification performance of the developed method was a combination of accuracy (ACCU), sensitivity (SENS), and specificity (SPEC). The results of the optimal model showed that all three metrics had a value of 1, indicating a perfect performance in identifying authentic Rhodiola species. This means that the developed method was able to accurately classify and identify the different species of Rhodiola with high precision."

        "Output": "Yes, the combination of FT-NIR spectroscopy and chemometrics analysis can be considered a superior method for the authenticity identification and classification of different species of Rhodiola, as compared to traditional methods. The past study compared various sample dividing methods, spectral preprocessing methods, wavelength selection methods, and modeling evaluation methods, and found that the combination of FT-NIR spectroscopy and chemometrics analysis outperformed others in terms of authenticity identification analysis. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the optimal model were all 1, indicating that this combination had the best performance in identifying authentic Rhodiola species. Additionally, the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model, which is a traditional method, had slightly lower classification performance compared to the combination of FT-NIR and chemometrics analysis. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combination of FT-NIR spectroscopy and chemometrics analysis has great potential in the authenticity identification and classification of Rhodiola species."
