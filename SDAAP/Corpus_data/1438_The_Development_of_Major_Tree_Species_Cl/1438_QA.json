        "Output": "Yes, the classification model using spectroscopic methods can be applied to accurately map major tree species such as Oak, Pine, Fir, Larch, and Korean pine on the Korean Peninsula. The model was developed with an accuracy of 98 percent for the Korean pine and Larch using Hyperion and Sentinel-2 satellite images, texture information, and geometric information. The model was then expanded to include Oak, Pine, Fir, Larch, and Korean pine, and achieved an overall accuracy of 80 percent with 0.80 kappa statistics. This indicates that the model has the potential to accurately classify and map these major tree species on the Korean Peninsula."
