This analysis was used to identify the relationships between heavy metal contents and spectral reflectance. It helped to identify the bands in the spectral data that were most strongly correlated with the heavy metal concentrations.\n\nIn terms of predicting heavy metal concentrations, the study found that the spectral transformation methods, combined with the correlation analysis, were effective in capturing the characteristic bands and enhancing the relations between heavy metal contents and spectral reflectance. The results showed that the chosen metric, correlation analysis, was able to provide valuable insights into the relationships between heavy metal concentrations and spectral data."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study's conclusion regarding the effectiveness of indirect inversion methods using spectral data for predicting heavy metal concentrations contributes to the development of a fast survey method for estimating soil heavy metal concentrations in a reclamation coal mine in Baishui County, China by providing evidence that these methods can effectively capture the characteristic bands and increase the relations between heavy metal contents and spectral reflectance. This means that by using spectral data and applying the appropriate spectral transformation methods, such as the Savitzky-Golay filter, first derivative reflectance (FDR), second derivative reflectance (SDR), continuum removal (CR), and continuous wavelet transform (CWT), it is possible to accurately estimate the concentrations of heavy metals in the soil. \n\nThe study also demonstrates that different machine learning algorithms, such as partial least squares regression (PLSR), extremely learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), can be used to establish quantitative relationships between heavy metal contents and spectral reflectance. In this particular study, the random forest (RF) model combined with CWT at the decomposition scales of 9 showed the best performance for inferring the concentrations of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) in the soil."
