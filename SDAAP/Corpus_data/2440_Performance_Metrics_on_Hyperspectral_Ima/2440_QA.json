        "Output": "The proposed method ensures the quality of food through the use of hyperspectral imaging and machine learning techniques by utilizing three underlying blocks: Hyperspectral Food Image Context Extractor (HFICE), Hyperspectral Context Fuzzy Classifier (HCFC), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Food Quality Analyzer (CFQA).\n\nThe Hyperspectral Food Image Context Extractor module is used as a preprocess to extract various food attributes such as texture, color, size, shape, and molecular particulars from hyperspectral food images.\n\nThe Hyperspectral Context Fuzzy Classifier module then identifies the specific part of the food (zone entity) and determines whether it is carbohydrate, fat, protein, water, or an unusable core. This classification helps in understanding the composition and quality of the food.\n\nFinally, the Convolutional Neural Network for Food Quality Analyzer module utilizes a tuned convolutional layer, heuristic activation operation, parallel element merge layer, and a regular fully connected layer to analyze the hyperspectral images and classify the food quality.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, benchmark datasets such as Indian Pines, Salinas, and Pavia are used, along with a dedicated chicken meat hyperspectral imaging dataset for training and testing."
