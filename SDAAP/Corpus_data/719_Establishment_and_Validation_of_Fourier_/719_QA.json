        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the results of the related study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR) can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for the quantification of linoleic acid in buffalo milk. The related study found that FT-MIR spectroscopy is a suitable technique for the analysis of linoleic acid, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.15 mg/mL milk. This suggests that FT-MIR spectroscopy is a viable and accurate method for the concentration analysis of linoleic acid in buffalo milk."
