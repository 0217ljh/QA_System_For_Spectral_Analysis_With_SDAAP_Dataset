        "Output": "Yes, based on the information provided, the GHO-TELM model can be considered a superior and reliable spectroscopic method for measuring SOM content in reclaimed mines. The model obtained the best performance indexes, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9586 and a relative percentage deviation (RPD) of 3.0823, indicating a good prediction effect. This suggests that the GHO-TELM model is effective in accurately and rapidly measuring SOM content in reclaimed mines, fulfilling the purpose of the study."
