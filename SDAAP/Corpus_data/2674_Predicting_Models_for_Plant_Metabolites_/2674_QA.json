        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction performance of the models in the related study is R2p (R-squared prediction). R2p measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (metabolite concentration) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral data). \n\nThe related study states that the boosting algorithms generally outperformed the PLSR models in terms of prediction accuracy. Specifically, the LightGBM model for chlorophyll and the AdaBoost model for flavonoids improved the prediction performance, with R2p values ranging from 0.71 to 0.74. In comparison, the PLSR models achieved R2p values ranging from 0.53 to 0.58.\n\nFor the glucosinolates and anthocyanins, the final models performed sufficiently for practical uses such as screening, with R2p values ranging from 0.82 to 0.85. Additionally, the models achieved RPD (Residual Prediction Deviation) values of 2.4 to 2.6, indicating their suitability for practical applications.\n\nBased on the information provided, it can be inferred that the R2p metric was used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models."
