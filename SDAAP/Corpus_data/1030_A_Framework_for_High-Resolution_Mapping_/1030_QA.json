Specifically, the Lasso, partial least squares (PLS), support vector regression (SVR), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) models were used for this purpose. These algorithms were trained using the FTIR-ATR spectra data and corresponding SOM content measurements from the 245 soil samples collected in northeast China. The trained models were then used to predict the SOM content for the entire study area based on the FTIR-ATR spectra obtained from Sentinel-2 images and DEM derivatives. The performance of these machine learning algorithms was evaluated in terms of their accuracy and resolution in predicting SOM content."

        "Output": "Yes, the framework based on machine learning and FTIR-ATR spectra can be considered superior to traditional methods for accurately estimating and mapping soil organic matter (SOM) content. The text states that traditional chemical analysis is unable to provide timely and dynamic estimation of SOM. In contrast, the framework developed in this study utilizes remote and proximal sensing techniques, such as Fourier mid-infrared attenuation total reflectance spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and Sentinel-2 images, along with machine learning algorithms. These methods offer advantages in terms of ease of use, estimation accuracy, and geographical resolution. The study's results indicate that the framework can achieve high accuracy and resolution in estimating SOM content, outperforming traditional methods. The use of machine learning algorithms, such as Lasso, partial least squares (PLS), support vector regression (SVR), and convolutional neural networks (CNN), further enhances the performance of SOM prediction. Additionally, the framework generates SOM maps with higher spatial resolution and variation compared to traditional approaches like Kriging. The PLS and SVR models, in particular, provide realistic and diverse local SOM maps, making them suitable for field-scale applications. Therefore, the framework based on machine learning and FTIR-ATR spectra can be considered superior to"
