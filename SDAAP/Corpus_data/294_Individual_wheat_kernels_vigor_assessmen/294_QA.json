        "Output": "The metric chosen in this study was the accuracy of the machine learning classification models. The study aimed to determine the feasibility of using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to detect individual wheat seed vigor and develop suitable classification models. The accuracy of the models was evaluated to assess their ability to discriminate and predict each wheat kernel's vigor. The results showed that the accuracies of the eight models developed ranged from 84.0% to 88.9%. Therefore, the chosen metric of accuracy demonstrated the effectiveness of using NIR spectroscopy and machine learning for determining wheat seed vigor."

        "Output": "It is not possible to determine whether the results of the past study can be generalized to other crops or agricultural applications. The past study specifically focuses on using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to detect individual wheat seed vigor and determine suitable machine learning classification models. The past study does not mention any experiments or findings related to other crops or agricultural applications. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct separate studies to determine the applicability of NIR spectroscopy and machine learning classification models for other crops or agricultural purposes."
