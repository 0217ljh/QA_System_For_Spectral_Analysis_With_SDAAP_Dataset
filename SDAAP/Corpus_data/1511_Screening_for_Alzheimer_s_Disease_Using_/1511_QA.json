        "Output": "The developed diagnostic algorithm using Raman hyperspectroscopic analysis of saliva has shown a higher accuracy compared to traditional methods for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study reported a 99% accuracy in differentiating between normative, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals during internal cross-validation. Additionally, blind external validation using an independent dataset achieved 100% accuracy. In contrast, current diagnostic methods for AD are described as inefficient, expensive, and unsuccessful at making diagnoses during the earliest stages of the disease. Therefore, the Raman hyperspectroscopic analysis of saliva offers a more accurate and potentially non-invasive method for diagnosing AD."
