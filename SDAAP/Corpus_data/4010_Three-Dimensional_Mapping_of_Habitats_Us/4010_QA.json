        "Output": "Yes, the developed remote-sensing method using high-resolution multispectral imagery and LiDAR data can be considered superior to traditional methods for creating 3D habitat maps. The study achieved high overall accuracies (91% and 82%) in two study areas in the United Kingdom, indicating the high potential of the developed method. By integrating multispectral imagery and LiDAR data, the method was able to discriminate between different habitat types and provide reliable 3D information. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods that primarily rely on same/cross-sensor features and overlook the benefits of multi-sensor data integration. Therefore, the developed remote-sensing method offers improved accuracy and effectiveness in creating 3D habitat maps."
