        "Output": "The metric chosen to investigate the possibility of improving the detection of codling moth (CM) infestation in apples was sensor data fusion using selected combined features (mid-level) from the sensor data. This metric achieved an accuracy of up to 94% using the AdaBoost classifier when only six acoustic and six HSI features were applied."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the sensor data fusion technique using combined features from HSI and acoustic signals can be applied to improve the detection of CM infestation in fruits other than apples. The study specifically focused on apples and their infestation by codling moths. Therefore, it is unclear whether this technique would be effective for detecting CM infestation in other fruits. Further research would be needed to determine the applicability of this technique to other fruit varieties."
