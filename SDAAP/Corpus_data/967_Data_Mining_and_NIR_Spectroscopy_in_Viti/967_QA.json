        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the combination of data mining and non-invasive NIR sensing can be considered a superior method for grapevine phenotyping compared to traditional methods. This is supported by the high accuracy achieved in grapevine variety discrimination and assessment of plant water status in viticulture, as mentioned in the related study. The machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), rotation forests, and M5 trees, combined with the non-invasive portable spectrophotometer, yielded classification accuracies of 88.7% and 92.5% for cross- and external validations, respectively, in grapevine variety discrimination. Additionally, the models developed for water stress assessment showed a determination coefficient of 0.84 and RMSEs of 0.164 and 0.165 MPa for both cross- and external validations. These results demonstrate the power and usefulness of the combined approach for grapevine phenotyping in viticulture, indicating its superiority over traditional methods."
