        "input": "",
        "Output": "A multi-spectral solar cell CNN model was established by extracting features from three basic networks. The three spectra in the original image were separated and sent to different CNNs, with the output characteristics of the three networks connected and fed into the fully connected layer to produce a predictive output. This approach allowed for the extraction of mixed features from multiple spectra, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish different defect features on solar cell surfaces."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the multi-spectral deep CNN model can be considered superior to traditional methods in terms of detecting solar cell surface defects and increasing the efficiency of solar cell manufacturing. The traditional manufacturing process relies on human eye detection, which is not as accurate and requires a large number of workers. In contrast, the multi-spectral deep CNN model is designed to detect defects with higher accuracy and greater adaptability. The model takes into account the heterogeneous texture and complex background of solar cell surfaces, and it is able to analyze the light spectrum features of solar cell color images to distinguish between complex texture background features and defect features. The experimental results and K-fold cross validation show that the multi-spectral deep CNN model can effectively detect solar cell surface defects with an accuracy of 94.30%. By applying such an algorithm, the efficiency of solar cell manufacturing can be increased, making the manufacturing process smarter."
