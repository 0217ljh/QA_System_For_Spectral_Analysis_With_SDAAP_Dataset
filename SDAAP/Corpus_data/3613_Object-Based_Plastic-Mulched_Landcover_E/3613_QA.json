        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification results in the related study is overall accuracy. The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified pixels or objects out of the total number of pixels or objects in the dataset. \n\nIn terms of accuracy, the study achieved an overall accuracy of 94.34% using the SVM classifier with integrated S1 and S2 data. This indicates that the classification method was able to accurately identify and classify plastic-mulched land-cover (PML) and other land-cover types. \n\nThe study also mentions that by adding SAR data into optical data, the accuracy of the object-based PML classifications was improved by 1-3%. This suggests that the inclusion of SAR data can further enhance the accuracy of PML mapping."
