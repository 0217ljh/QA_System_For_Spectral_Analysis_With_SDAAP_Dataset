        "Output": "In the research on nondestructive soybean classification, the chosen metric was classification accuracy. The metric measures the percentage of correctly classified soybean samples. The research found that the ensemble classification algorithm RSLD achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.2% when using 155 features to classify 15 types of soybeans. This indicates that the RSLD method is highly accurate in classifying soybeans nondestructively."

The related study specifically focuses on the development and application of the RSLD algorithm for nondestructive soybean classification. Therefore, further research or experimentation would be required to determine if the RSLD algorithm can be successfully applied to other crops or agricultural products."
