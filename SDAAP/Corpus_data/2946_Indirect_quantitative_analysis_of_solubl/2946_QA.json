        "Output": "The proposed method for determining SSC in citrus using hyperspectral imaging of citrus leaves is described as accurate and reliable. According to the related study, the correlation coefficients of prediction-real value by citrus and its leaves in cross-validation were 0.972 and 0.986, respectively. This indicates a strong correlation between the predicted and actual SSC values. Additionally, the related study states that the proposed method is a non-destructive and reliable method for determining SSC by citrus leaves. Therefore, based on the information provided, the proposed method appears to be comparable or even superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and reliability."
