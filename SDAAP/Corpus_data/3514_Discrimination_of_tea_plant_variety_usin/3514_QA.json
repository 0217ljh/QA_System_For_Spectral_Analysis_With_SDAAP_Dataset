        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of tea plant variety discrimination using multispectral image information was the percentage of correctly classified samples. This metric measures the proportion of tea plant varieties that were correctly identified by the classification models. \n\nThe study reported that the accuracy achieved in the training set was 97.00%, in the test set was 90.52%, and in the validation set was 88.67%. These values indicate the percentage of correctly classified samples in each set. \n\nBased on these results, it can be concluded that the classification models using multispectral image information were able to accurately discriminate between tea plant varieties."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fusion of data using SPA and the support vector machine (SVM) classification model was highly effective in identifying tea plant varieties using multispectral image information. The study achieved accuracy rates of 97.00% in the training set, 90.52% in the test set, and 88.67% in the validation set. This indicates that the combination of SPA and SVM provided a feasible method for discriminating between different types of high-yield tea plant varieties. The results suggest that the fusion of data and classification model can be used as a reliable approach for identifying tea plant varieties based on multispectral image information."
