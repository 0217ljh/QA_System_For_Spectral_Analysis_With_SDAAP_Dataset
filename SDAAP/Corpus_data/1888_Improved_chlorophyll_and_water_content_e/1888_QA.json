        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed Spiking-Hybrid method outperforms the empirical machine learning method in estimating Cab and Cw in terms of accuracy and robustness. The study found that both the proposed method and the empirical method performed better than the other two common methods for estimating Cab and Cw. However, the proposed Spiking-Hybrid method consistently achieved higher accuracy and better robustness than the empirical machine learning method, especially when the number of available in-situ samples was limited (less than 5% of the total training samples). This suggests that the Spiking-Hybrid method, which combines mechanistic model simulation with machine learning and leverages a spiking technique, can achieve accurate and robust estimations for Cab and Cw even with a significantly reduced number of in-situ samples."
