        "Output": "Yes, the digital models developed using supervised machine learning regression algorithms based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) can be considered superior to traditional brewing techniques in accurately estimating physicochemical parameters and sensory attributes of beers. The results mentioned in the text show that these models were highly accurate in estimating physicochemical parameters (Model 1; R = 0.94; b = 0.91), intensity of sensory descriptors (Model 2; R = 0.99; b = 0.98), liking of sensory attributes (Model 3; R = 0.97; b = 0.99), and the classification of fermentation treatments (Model 4; 96% accuracy). These digital tools provide affordable and accurate methodologies for assessing quality traits and sensory analysis of beers, allowing craft brewing companies to maintain specific quality traits and sensory profiles while creating original styles of beers."
