The researchers used five bands (red, green, blue, near-infra-red (NIR), and red-edge) multispectral images acquired at various growth stages of peanuts using UAV. They analyzed the correlation between spectral bands and yield for each growth stage.\n\nTo predict peanut yield, the researchers employed multiple linear regression and seven non-linear ML models. The hyperparameters of these models were optimized using simulated annealing (SA). The ML models used in the study included random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost.\n\nAfter evaluating the performance of these ML models, the best three models (RF, SVM, and XGBoost) were selected. These models were then used to construct a cooperative yield prediction framework. The framework included both the best ML model and an ensemble scheme from the best three models. This cooperative framework provided comparable recommendations to the farmers for peanut yield prediction based on the UAV multispectral data."

In this study, the correlation analysis between these spectral bands and peanut yield showed a significant relationship, particularly during the maturity stages of the crop. This indicates that these bands contain valuable information related to peanut yield.\n\nBy utilizing these four spectral bands, the researchers were able to develop machine learning (ML) models for peanut yield prediction. Multiple linear regression and seven non-linear ML models were employed, and their hyperparameters were optimized using simulated annealing. Among these models, the best three were random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost.\n\nThe integration of these ML models, along with the ensemble scheme from the best three models, resulted in a cooperative yield prediction framework. This framework provides accurate predictions and can serve as a valuable recommendation tool for farmers. The use of UAV multispectral data and the inclusion of spectral bands in the ML models enhance the precision and reliability of peanut yield prediction, surpassing the accuracy achieved by traditional methods."
