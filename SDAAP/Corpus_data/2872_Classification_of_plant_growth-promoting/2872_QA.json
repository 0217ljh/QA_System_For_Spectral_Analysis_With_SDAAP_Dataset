        "input": "",
        "Output": "The predictive ability of hyperspectral reflectance data and genomic data is compared to traditional methods in predicting inoculation status and plant growth-related traits in maize. The study found that hyperspectral prediction showed greater predictive ability for shoot dry mass and stalk diameter, while genomic prediction was better for plant height. However, when both hyperspectral and genomic data were combined in prediction models, the predictive ability was as high as that of phenomics or genomics alone. This suggests that the use of hyperspectral-based phenotyping, in addition to genomic data, can enhance the accuracy of predictions for these traits in maize."
