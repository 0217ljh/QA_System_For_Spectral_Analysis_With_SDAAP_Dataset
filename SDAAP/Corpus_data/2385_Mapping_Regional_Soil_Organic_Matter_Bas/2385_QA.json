        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the predictive performances of the algorithms on soil organic matter (SOM) prediction was the mean relative improvement (RI). The mean RI was used to compare the performance of different algorithms and datasets. It measures the improvement in prediction accuracy achieved by using a specific algorithm or dataset compared to a baseline. \n\nThe study found that the application of Sentinel-2A data resulted in mean RIs of 7.67% and 5.87% compared to the common-band variable datasets of Sentinel-2A and MODIS images, respectively. This indicates that using the full-band Sentinel-2A dataset improved the predictive performance of the algorithms by 7.67% and 5.87% in the respective scenarios.\n\nThe metric of mean RI provides a quantitative measure of the improvement in prediction accuracy, allowing for a comparison between different algorithms and datasets."

The use of Sentinel-2A data resulted in mean relative improvements (RIs) of 7.67% and 5.87% compared to the common-band variable datasets of Sentinel-2A and MODIS images, respectively. \n\nAmong the machine learning algorithms evaluated, the random forest (RF) algorithm performed the best. It achieved a lower root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.68% and a higher coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.67 in all of the predicted scenarios compared to the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms. \n\nOverall, the combination of the full-band Sentinel-2A dataset and the RF algorithm proved to be the most effective approach for mapping soil organic matter using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The resultant SOM map accurately characterized the spatial distribution of SOM in the Songnen Plain."
