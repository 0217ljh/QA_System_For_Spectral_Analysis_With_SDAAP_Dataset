The past study investigated four coffee varieties in China and applied ten different pattern recognition methods. The classification accuracy for coffee variety identification varied among the methods used, with some classified as highly effective, medium effectiveness, and low effectiveness. Therefore, it can be inferred that mid-infrared transmittance spectroscopy combined with pattern recognition algorithms may offer advantages over traditional methods for identifying different coffee varieties."
