        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of spectral indices-based band selection (SIs) with one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN) improves the classification accuracy and reduces information redundancy in the automatic oil film classification model using hyperspectral remote sensing images in the following ways:\n\n1. Reducing information redundancy: Spectral indices-based band selection (SIs) helps in selecting the most relevant bands from the hyperspectral remote sensing images. This selection process eliminates redundant bands, which reduces the amount of redundant information in the classification model. By removing redundant bands, the model becomes more efficient and less prone to overfitting.\n\n2. Improved classification accuracy: The one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN) are powerful deep learning models that can effectively extract features from the selected bands. These networks are designed to capture spatial dependencies in the data, which is crucial for accurately classifying oil films in hyperspectral remote sensing images. By combining SIs with 1D CNN, the model can leverage the selected bands' spectral characteristics and the CNN's ability to learn complex patterns, resulting in improved classification accuracy."
