The study also analyzes the transfer learning effect of these algorithms in different spatial resolutions and spectral ranges. The classification results of high, medium, and low spatial resolution images are fused using the majority voting method. Additionally, the integration of pixel-based classification and object-based classification is explored using multi-scale segmentation. The study quantitatively analyzes the average accuracies of different spatial resolutions in order to assess the classification ability of spatial resolution to marsh vegetation."
