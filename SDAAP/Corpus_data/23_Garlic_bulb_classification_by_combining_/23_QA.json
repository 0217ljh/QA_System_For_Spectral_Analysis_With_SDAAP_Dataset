        "input": "",
        "Output": "The Raman spectra of garlic bulbs were collected and used in combination with machine learning techniques to achieve origin traceability of five garlic bulb species. The Raman spectra were first pre-processed, and then the wavenumbers and intensities of distinct Raman peaks were extracted as the input data for developing the classification model. The trained model demonstrated an accuracy of 98.97%, a precision of 98.92%, and a sensitivity of 98.86%. The results indicate that the combination of Raman spectroscopy and machine learning, along with the artificial prior feature extraction strategy, effectively prevented over-fitting due to external variables and greatly improved the accuracy of the model. This approach offers a novel classification and origin identification scheme for plant bulbs, specifically for garlic bulbs."
