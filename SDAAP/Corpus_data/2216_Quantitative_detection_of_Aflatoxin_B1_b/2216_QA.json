        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the detection method is R-2 (R-squared). R-2 is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (in this case, the relative content of AFB1) that can be explained by the independent variables (the hyperspectral values). It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.\n\nThe R-2 value obtained for the modified ResNet18 model was 0.8898. This indicates that approximately 88.98% of the variance in the AFB1 content can be explained by the hyperspectral values. \n\nIn terms of how far this metric can go, a higher R-2 value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. However, it is important to note that the interpretation of R-2 depends on the context and the specific application. In this case, an R-2 value of 0.8898 suggests a strong relationship between the hyperspectral values and the AFB1 content, indicating the effectiveness of the detection method."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed regression method based on deep learning can be considered as a superior alternative to traditional methods for the detection of AFB1 in peanuts using quantitative remote sensing. The experimental results showed that the modified ResNet18 model achieved the best effect, with a high R-2 value of 0.8898, low RMSE value of 0.0138, and a high RPD value of 2.8851. These metrics indicate that the deep learning regression network is able to accurately quantify the relative content of AFB1 at the sub-pixel level. Compared to traditional methods, the deep learning approach offers higher predictive ability and robustness, making it a promising solution for AFB1 detection in peanuts using quantitative remote sensing."
