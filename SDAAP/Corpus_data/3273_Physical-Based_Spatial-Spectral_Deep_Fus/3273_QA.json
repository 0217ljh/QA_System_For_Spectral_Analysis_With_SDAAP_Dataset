        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed physical-based spatial-spectral deep fusion network (PSSDFN) can be used to enhance the accuracy of Chl-a estimation in coastal water areas within 1 km from the shoreline in large- and medium-sized lakes/oceans. The research conducted using the PSSDFN in Lake Chaohu as the related study area showed that collaborative retrieval using the fused and MSI data greatly improved the accuracy compared to MSI retrieval alone. This indicates that the PSSDFN can effectively reconcile spatial and spectral information, and extract effective features using residual connectivity and attention mechanisms. Therefore, the PSSDFN can be a valuable tool for monitoring and evaluating Chl-a in coastal water environments."
