        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the inclusion of spectroscopic information can improve the accuracy of predicting cell dry mass and recombinant protein in biopharmaceutical production processes compared to models based solely on routinely measured process variables. The study mentioned in the text found that models based on routinely measured process variables alone had a prediction accuracy of about +/- 4% for cell dry mass. However, when spectroscopic information was added to the models, the prediction accuracy for protein concentration improved to within +/- 12%. This indicates that the additional spectroscopic information provided a more comprehensive understanding of the bioprocesses and allowed for a more accurate estimation of the protein concentration. Therefore, a combined approach using neural networks as the modeling technique and random forest as the variable selection tool was recommended."
