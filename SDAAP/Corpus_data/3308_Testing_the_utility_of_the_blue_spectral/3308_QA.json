The performance of these spectral indices was evaluated using the True Skill Statistic (TSS). The study found that the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and Normalized Burned Index (NBI) performed better than all the other spectral indices considered in the two study sites. The Burned Area Index (BAI) was the third highest performing spectral index."
