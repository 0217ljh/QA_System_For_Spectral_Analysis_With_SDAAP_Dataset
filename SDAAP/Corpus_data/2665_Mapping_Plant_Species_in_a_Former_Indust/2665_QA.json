        "Output": "The Shannon index was chosen to assess biodiversity in the related study. It can range from 0 (homogeneous site) to 3.32 (heterogeneous distribution of species within the site) and can provide insights into the heterogeneity of the sites. However, it may not be sufficient to fully discriminate species and assess biodiversity in a complex impacted context."
