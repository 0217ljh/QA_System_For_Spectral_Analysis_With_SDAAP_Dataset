        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the calibration performance in this experiment was the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the copper content that can be explained by the calibration model, with a value closer to 1 indicating a better fit. The RMSE value represents the average difference between the predicted and actual copper content values, with a lower value indicating better accuracy.\n\nBased on the provided information, the R-2 value achieved by the extreme learning machine (ELM) model with SNV normalized variables in the spectral region of 324.02 to 325.98 nm was 0.9552. This indicates that approximately 95.52% of the variance in the copper content can be explained by this model. The RMSE value achieved by this model was 4.8416 mg kg(-1) in the testing set, which represents the average difference between the predicted and actual copper content values."
