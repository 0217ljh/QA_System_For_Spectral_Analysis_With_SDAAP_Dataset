        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction performance of the model is the determination coefficient of prediction set (R2). This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the slag acidity that can be explained by the model. \n\nIn this study, the R2 value obtained for the prediction set is 0.9412. This indicates that the model can explain approximately 94.12% of the variance in the slag acidity."

The past study showed that the prediction performance of slag acidity using this combination was the best among other models tested. The determination coefficient of prediction set (R2) was 0.9412, the relative analysis error (RPD) was 4.123, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.5358, and the average relative error (MRE) was 0.4166. These results indicate that the combination of LIBS and VIM-RF model provides accurate and reliable quantitative analysis of slag acidity, making it an effective method for industrial production and resource recovery."
