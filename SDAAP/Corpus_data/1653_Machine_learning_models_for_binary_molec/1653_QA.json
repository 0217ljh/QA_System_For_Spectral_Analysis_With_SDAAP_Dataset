        "Output": "Yes,based on the provided text, it can be inferred that the use of machine learning methods for inferring molecular structure from vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) absorption spectra is considered superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy and minimizing statistical uncertainties. The primary objective of the study was to identify suitable methods that enable accurate predictions of molecular structure classifications with minimized statistical uncertainties. The text also mentions that machine learning models were developed using differential absorption spectroscopy measurements in the VUV region, and several modeling methods were employed in the analysis of the absorption spectra. The outcome of the study suggests that optimal determination of molecular structure using machine learning methods depends on the absorption region, and separate machine learning models were developed for each molecular classification. Therefore, the use of machine learning methods in this context is aimed at improving accuracy and reducing statistical uncertainties in inferring molecular structure from VUV absorption spectra."
