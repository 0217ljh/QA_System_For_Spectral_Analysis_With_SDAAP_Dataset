        "Output": "In the related study, the researchers compared the performance of the Soil Quartz Clay Mineral Index (SQCMI) with direct estimation of quartz content using a gradient-boosting algorithm. They evaluated the correlation, root mean square error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) for both methods. \n\nThe results showed that the SQCMI was highly and significantly correlated with the Vis-NIR-SWIR spectral region (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.01, RPD = 2.34). On the other hand, the direct estimation of quartz content using the gradient-boosting algorithm against the Vis-NIR-SWIR region provided poor results (R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 15.63, RPD = 1.32). \n\nThis indicates that the SQCMI method outperformed the direct estimation approach in accurately determining the quartz content in the soil. Additionally, the estimation of the SQCMI value was even more accurate when only the 2000-2450 nm spectral range (atmospheric window) was used (R-2 = 0.9, RMSE = 0.005, RPD = 1.95)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the findings of the related study support the use of the optical region as a superior method for spectrally identifying quartz content in soil compared to traditional LWIR methods. The study demonstrates that indirect relationships between the optical and LWIR regions can be used to assess quartz content spectrally using solely the optical region. The Soil Quartz Clay Mineral Index (SQCMI) developed in the study showed a high and significant correlation with the Vis-NIR-SWIR spectral region, indicating that the optical region can accurately estimate quartz content relative to clay minerals in the soil. In contrast, direct estimation of quartz content using LWIR methods provided poor results. Therefore, the study suggests that reflectance data across the 2000-2450 nm spectral region in the optical region can be used satisfactorily to estimate quartz content in soil using hyperspectral remote sensing means."
