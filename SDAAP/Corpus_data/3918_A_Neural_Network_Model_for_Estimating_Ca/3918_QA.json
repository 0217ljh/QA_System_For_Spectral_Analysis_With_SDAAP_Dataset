        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of the regression neural network model in assessing carbon fluxes using machine learning methods is reported to have high correlation coefficients (R) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSE). Specifically, for gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (TER), the correlation coefficients are greater than 0.9 and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients are greater than or equal to 0.87. However, for net ecosystem exchange (NEE), the correlation coefficient is 0.4 and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient is 0.15. \n\nIn comparison to traditional methods, the regression neural network model shows higher correlation coefficients and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients for GPP and TER. This suggests that the machine learning approach is more effective in accurately assessing carbon fluxes in the given context. However, for NEE, the performance of the model is relatively lower compared to traditional methods, indicating that further improvements may be needed in this aspect."
