        "input": "",
        "Output": "The non-invasive approach using optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and multivariate data analysis has shown to be highly accurate in monitoring plasma parameters such as electron temperature and density. The empirical correlation established through simultaneous OES and other diagnostics has provided reliable results, with a prediction accuracy of 97% for electron density and 90% for electron temperature.\n\nIn terms of interference with the plasma process, the non-invasive approach is advantageous. It allows for in-situ and real-time analysis without disturbing the plasma or interfering with the process. This is particularly useful in plasma processing, where maintaining the stability and integrity of the plasma is crucial for successful outcomes. Traditional methods, on the other hand, may involve invasive techniques that can disrupt the plasma and potentially affect the accuracy of the measurements.\n\nOverall, the non-invasive approach using OES and multivariate data analysis offers high accuracy and minimal interference with the plasma process, making it a valuable tool for monitoring plasma parameters in real-time."
