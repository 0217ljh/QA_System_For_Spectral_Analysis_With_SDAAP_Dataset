        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fuzzy output support vector machine (SVM) contributes to the effectiveness of combining multispectral very high resolution (VHR) and hyperspectral satellite imagery through a decision fusion approach for accurate forest species mapping by conducting fuzzy classifications on each satellite image. This allows for a more flexible and nuanced classification process, taking into account the uncertainty and imprecision in the data. The fuzzy SVM outputs from both the multispectral and hyperspectral images are then combined using a fusion operator, effectively exploiting the complementary information provided by the two sources. This approach avoids the need for computationally demanding and time-consuming data fusion or vector stacking methods. The use of fuzzy SVM and decision fusion enhances the accuracy of the forest species mapping, as demonstrated by an 8% increase in accuracy compared to using only the multispectral imagery and even higher compared to using only the hyperspectral satellite image."
