        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, multispectral remote sensing techniques, including UAV and satellite imagery, can be used to detect and classify beached R. okamurae and other substrate covers in the monitoring pilot of R. okamurae in Tarifa, Spain. The related study used UAV flights and satellite image acquisitions to collect multispectral data. The spectral information obtained from these images was then used to train a supervised classification method, specifically the Super Vector Machine (SVM) method, to classify different substrate covers, including beached R. okamurae. The results showed that the multispectral images allowed for the detection of beached R. okamurae, and the classification accuracy varied depending on the image resolution. The UAV imagery provided precise delimitation of the area occupied by R. okamurae, while satellite data were capable of detecting its presence and generating early warnings. Therefore, the study demonstrates the usefulness of multispectral remote sensing techniques in monitoring the presence and distribution of R. okamurae and other substrate covers in coastal areas like Tarifa, Spain."
