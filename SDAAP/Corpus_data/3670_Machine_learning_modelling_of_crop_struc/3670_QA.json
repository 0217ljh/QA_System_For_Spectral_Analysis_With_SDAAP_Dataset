        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the findings of the related study, the combination of spectral vegetation indices with Sentinel-2 reflectance bands did not consistently yield improved results for estimating maize crop structural parameters compared to using individual spectral bands alone. The study found that combining reflectance bands and vegetation indices as modelling predictors yielded the highest validation accuracy for only one out of the four crop structural parameters (DAI). The reflectance bands only scenario yielded the highest validation accuracies for two crop structural parameters (HT and SD). Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the combination of spectral vegetation indices with Sentinel-2 reflectance bands is a superior method for estimating maize crop structural parameters in the related study."
