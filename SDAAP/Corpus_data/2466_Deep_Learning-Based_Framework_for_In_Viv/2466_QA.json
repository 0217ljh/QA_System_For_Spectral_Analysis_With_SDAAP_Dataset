        "input": "",
        "Output": "A smooth filter was applied to remove noise, extreme bands with high noise were removed, band averaging was performed to reduce redundant information, and spectral signatures were normalized between zero and one to avoid differences in radiation intensities."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The purpose of developing a deep learning-based framework for processing hyperspectral images to assist surgeons in accurately resecting brain tumors is to provide reliable support for tumor resection during brain cancer surgery. The framework aims to generate a thematic map that delineates the parenchymal area of the brain and identifies the location of the tumor. This map can then guide the operating surgeon in performing a successful and precise tumor resection, while preserving as much normal brain tissue as possible for the patient."

        "instruction": "Can the deep learning-based framework using hyperspectral imaging be used to assist surgeons in accurately resecting brain tumors?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the deep learning-based framework using hyperspectral imaging can be used to assist surgeons in accurately resecting brain tumors. The framework is able to generate a thematic map that delineates the parenchymal area of the brain and identifies the location of the tumor. This provides guidance to the operating surgeon for a successful and precise tumor resection. The framework achieves an overall accuracy of 80% for multiclass classification, which is an improvement compared to traditional support vector machine (SVM)-based approaches. Additionally, an aid visualization system is presented, allowing the operating surgeon to adjust the final thematic map to find the optimal classification threshold for the current situation during the surgical procedure."
