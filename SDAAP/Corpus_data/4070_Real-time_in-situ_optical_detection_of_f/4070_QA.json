The related study states that traditional measurement methods have significant drawbacks in terms of accuracy, response time, and the requirement for the sample to be in motion. In contrast, the proposed method utilizes spectral line intensity to quantitatively reflect viscosity, which allows for accurate measurements. Additionally, the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and the RBF neural network improves the efficiency of the measurement process. The results of the study show that the accuracy of the predictions conducted by the RBF neural network reached 98.45%, indicating that the complicated and non-linear relationships between spectra formation and viscosity can be well depicted. Therefore, the proposed method represents a great leap forward in viscosity measurement and fundamentally reforms traditional measurement methods."
