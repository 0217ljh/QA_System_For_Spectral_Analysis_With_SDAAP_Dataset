        "Output": "The metric chosen in the machine learning-based classification approach for objective diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders is accuracy. The accuracy metric measures the percentage of correctly predicted classes out of all the classes. In the related study, the accuracy achieved by the three supervised learning algorithms (naive bayes, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines) was above 81%. This indicates that the machine learning approach has a high level of accuracy in correctly predicting the class of each participant across the four classes of neuropsychiatric disorders (migraine, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and healthy)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-derived biomarkers can be considered superior to traditional methods in the machine learning-based classification approach for objective diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with frontal lobe dysfunction. This is supported by the findings of the study mentioned in the related study, which achieved high classification accuracies and specificities using fNIRS-derived biomarkers and machine learning algorithms. The objective nature of fNIRS-derived features eliminates subjective report bias, making it a reliable and potentially valuable tool for the objective diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders."
