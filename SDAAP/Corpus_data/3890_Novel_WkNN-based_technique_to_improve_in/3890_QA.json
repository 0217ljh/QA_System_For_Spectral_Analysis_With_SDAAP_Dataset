        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the results of the rainfall estimation in the related study is the correlation coefficient (r). The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the estimated rainfall values and the observed rainfall values from the ground radar. \n\nThe correlation coefficient can provide valuable information about the accuracy of the estimation by indicating how well the estimated values align with the observed values. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, while a correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship. A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no linear relationship."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed method using the k nearest weighted neighbours (WkNN) classification algorithm contributes to the estimation of rainfall in northern Algeria by utilizing the dataset from the radiometer-imager SEVIRI on the satellite MSG. It determines the pixel rainfall rate among the 16 predefined intensity levels observed in the Setif meteorological radar.\n\nThe implementation of the classification involves using the spectral characteristics of a new sample (pixel) as input variables for the WkNN classifier. This classifier predicts the class of membership for the new sample based on the weighted distances separating it from the samples in the set of learning.\n\nThe results obtained from this method are then validated by comparing them to the rainfall intensity classes observed and co-located by ground radar. The results show a significant improvement in the instantaneous estimate of precipitation during the day, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.87 and statistical parameters such as RMSE = 2.29 mm/h, Bias = 0.45 mm/h, and MAE = 0.35 mm/h. Similar results are obtained overnight.\n\nOverall, the proposed method using the WkNN classification algorithm provides a more accurate estimation of rainfall in northern Algeria by leveraging spectral characteristics and validating the results with ground radar observations."

The study specifically focuses on the estimation of rainfall in northern Algeria using the dataset from the radiometer-imager SEVIRI boarded on the satellite MSG. \n\nTo determine if the algorithm can be applied to other regions with different spectral characteristics, further research and experimentation would be required. Factors such as the availability of similar datasets, the comparability of spectral characteristics, and the validation of results with ground radar observations would need to be considered."
