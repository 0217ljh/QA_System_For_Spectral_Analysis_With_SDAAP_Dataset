        "Output": "The metric chosen to improve soybean yield prediction in the related study was the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the yield that can be explained by the combination of variables used in the model. The RMSE value represents the average difference between the predicted yield and the actual yield, providing a measure of the accuracy of the estimation.\n\nThe study found that combining the maturity group information (M) with remote sensing data significantly improved the estimation performances of soybean yield. The best estimation accuracy was achieved when three variables (vegetation indices, texture features, and M) were combined. Additionally, using multiple growth stages produced better estimation performance compared to using a single time point.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of R2 and RMSE, along with the combination of variables and growth stages, can go a long way in improving soybean yield prediction."

The related study found that the method of combining maturity group information (M) with remote sensing data resulted in improved accuracy in predicting soybean yield.\n\nThe study investigated three types of maturity groups (Early, Median, and Late) of soybean and collected UAV-based hyperspectral and red-green-blue (RGB) images at three key growth stages. Vegetation indices (VI) and texture features (Te) were extracted and combined with M to predict yield using machine learning algorithms such as partial least square regression (PLSR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forest regression (RFR), and kernel ridge regression (KRR).\n\nThe results showed that the combinations of three variables (VI, Te, and M) provided the best estimation accuracy. Additionally, the flowering stage was identified as the optimal single time point for yield estimation, while using multiple growth stages produced the best estimation performance. The models built by GPR showed the best performances among the different algorithms tested for different growth stages.\n\nOverall, combining maturity group information with UAV-based multi-sensor data using machine learning methods improves soybean yield prediction by providing more"
