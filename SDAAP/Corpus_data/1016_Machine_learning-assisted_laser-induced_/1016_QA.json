        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction models in this study is the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The RMSEP measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values, providing an indication of the accuracy of the prediction model.\n\nAs for how far this metric can go, the text states that the prediction model using only focusing spectra resulted in an RMSEP of 0.1943-0.2175 wt%, while the prediction model using both focusing and defocusing spectra led to an enhanced RMSEP of 0.0210-0.0316 wt%. This suggests that incorporating defocusing data significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction model, reducing the RMSEP by approximately 10 times. However, the text does not provide any further information on the potential upper limit or range of the RMSEP."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The inclusion of defocusing data in the prediction models constructed using machine learning methods significantly enhances the accuracy of online monitoring of molten salt systems in advanced nuclear reactors. The study found that when both focusing and defocusing spectra were used to train the prediction models, the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was approximately 10 times lower compared to using only focusing spectra. This implies that the defocusing data provides valuable information that improves the accuracy of the prediction models. Considering the practical usage of these models in real systems, especially in the complex processes of the nuclear industry, it is important to include both focusing and defocusing data in order to effectively monitor and control molten salt systems."
