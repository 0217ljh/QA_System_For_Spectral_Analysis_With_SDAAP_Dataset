        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze the impact of different reindeer grazing practices on the occurrence and biomass of willows, as well as their ability to form dense thickets, in the study on willow dominated patches. The related study mentions the use of multispectral and RGB imagery obtained from unoccupied aerial vehicles field data, which is a form of spectroscopic analysis. This data, combined with machine-learning models, allowed the researchers to model the occurrence of plant community types, above-ground biomass fractions, and topsoil moisture. Therefore, spectroscopic methods were utilized in this study to analyze the impact of reindeer grazing practices on willows."
