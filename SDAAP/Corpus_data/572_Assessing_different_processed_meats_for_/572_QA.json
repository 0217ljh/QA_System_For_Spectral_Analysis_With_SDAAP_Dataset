        "Output": "The metric chosen in the related study was the correlation coefficient, denoted as \"r,\" and the ratio of performance to deviation, denoted as \"RPD.\" These metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the models in predicting adulterant levels. \n\nIn terms of classification and prediction outputs, the correlation coefficient (r) ranged from 0.78 to 0.86, indicating a moderate to strong positive correlation between the predicted and actual adulterant levels. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) ranged from 1.19 to 1.98, which suggests that the models had a moderate to good level of accuracy in predicting the adulterant levels. \n\nOverall, these metrics indicate that the selected models based on spectroscopic technology had a reasonably good performance in classifying and predicting adulterant levels in minced beef and pork samples."

        "Output": "Machine learning techniques were used in the related study to classify samples and predict the presence and type of adulterants in minced beef and pork. The researchers employed multiple machine learning techniques for classification, adulterant prediction, and wavelength selection. They first evaluated the samples for the presence or absence of adulterants, categorizing them into six classes. Then, they assessed the adulterant type and level, also using six classes. \n\nTo achieve this, the researchers utilized spectroscopic systems in the visible/near-infrared (Vis-NIR) range of 400-1000 nm and the near-infrared (NIR) range of 900-1700 nm. They compared the performance of models using selected wavelengths versus models using the full range of wavelengths. The selected wavelengths models generally yielded better classification and prediction outputs.\n\nIn terms of classification rates, the first stage, which determined the presence or absence of adulterants, achieved rates of 96% for pure/unadulterated samples and 100% for adulterated samples. The second stage, which identified the type and level of adulterants, had classification rates ranging from 69% to 100%.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers developed optimal models for predicting adulterant levels. These models yielded a correlation coefficient"

The related study reported that multiple machine learning techniques were used for classification, adulterant prediction, and wavelength selection. The selected wavelengths models generally resulted in better classification and prediction outputs than using the full range of wavelengths. The first stage classification rates for pure/unadulterated and adulterated samples were 96% and 100% respectively. The second stage had classification rates ranging from 69% to 100%. The optimal models for predicting adulterant levels yielded correlation coefficients (r) of 0.78-0.86 and ratios of performance to deviation (RPD) of 1.19-1.98.
