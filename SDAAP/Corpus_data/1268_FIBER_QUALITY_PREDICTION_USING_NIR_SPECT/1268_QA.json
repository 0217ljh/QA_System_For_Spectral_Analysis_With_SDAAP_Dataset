        "input": "",
        "Output": "The performance of tree-based gradient-boosting machines was found to be better than artificial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting tracheid width in wood. This was observed regardless of the number of features or the dimensionality of the data.\n\nAdditionally, it was noted that the application of principal component analysis (PCA) negatively affected the performance of both the tree-based gradient-boosting machines and the ANNs. The models performed better without PCA, indicating that dimensionality reduction was not necessary for analyzing the near infrared (NIR) spectra data in this study.\n\nIn conclusion, the study suggests that tree-based gradient-boosting machines are more effective than ANNs for predicting tracheid width in wood using a medium-sized NIR spectral dataset. Furthermore, the application of PCA did not improve the performance of the models in this particular case."
