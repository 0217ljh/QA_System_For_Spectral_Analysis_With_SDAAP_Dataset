        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to improve the feasibility and accuracy of estimating maize phenotypic traits is the coefficient of determination (R2). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (phenotypic traits) that can be explained by the independent variables (features extracted from UAV images). \n\nThe R2 values obtained in the study were 0.852, 0.888, and 0.929 for LAI, FW, and DW (leaf area index, fresh weight, and dry weight) respectively. These values indicate that the estimation models using the ensemble learning approach and the combination of UAV-based multisource data achieved a high level of accuracy in estimating the phenotypic traits of breeding maize at the plot scale. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of coefficient of determination (R2) demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of the estimation models in the related study."

The related study found that among the features extracted from UAV RGB images, the highest accuracy was obtained by using the combination of spectrum, structure, and texture features. The ensemble learning models, such as stacking and Bayesian model averaging (BMA), further improved the accuracy and stability of maize phenotypic traits estimation. Therefore, the combination of these features and ensemble learning models, along with multispectral sensors, can accurately estimate phenotyping traits of breeding maize at plot scale."
