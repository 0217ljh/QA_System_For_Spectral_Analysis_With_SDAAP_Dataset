        "Output": "To assess the diagnostic capabilities of Raman spectroscopy with RF in comparison to IgM capture ELISA for dengue fever analysis in infected human sera, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated.\n\nSensitivity is the ability of the test to correctly identify positive cases. In this case, it refers to the ability of Raman spectroscopy with RF to correctly identify dengue-positive samples. The sensitivity was calculated by dividing the number of true positive results (samples correctly identified as dengue-positive) by the total number of dengue-positive samples.\n\nSpecificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify negative cases. In this case, it refers to the ability of Raman spectroscopy with RF to correctly identify dengue-negative samples. The specificity was calculated by dividing the number of true negative results (samples correctly identified as dengue-negative) by the total number of dengue-negative samples.\n\nAccuracy is the overall correctness of the test, taking into account both true positive and true negative results. It was calculated by dividing the sum of true positive and true negative results by the total number of samples."
