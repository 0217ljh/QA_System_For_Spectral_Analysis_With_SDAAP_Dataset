        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification results in this study is the overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient (KC), and average accuracy (AA). The overall accuracy measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. The kappa coefficient takes into account the agreement between the observed and expected classifications, considering the possibility of agreement by chance. The average accuracy calculates the average accuracy for each class.\n\nThese metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of land-use classification."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed MAM-HybridNet framework outperforms other classification algorithms in terms of accuracy for land-use classification in cities with high surface humidity. The results show that with the support of full-band data (SAR + MS + spectral index), the MAM-HybridNet algorithm achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 98.87%, a kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.98, and an average accuracy (AA) of 98.36%. These results are better than the classification results obtained using other algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), 2D convolutional neural networks, 3D convolutional neural networks, and hybridSN classification models. Therefore, the MAM-HybridNet framework is more accurate for land-use classification in cities with high surface humidity compared to other classification algorithms."

        "Output": "The fusion classification based on Sentinel-2B MSI and Sentinel-1A SAR data outperforms traditional methods in improving the accuracy of land-use classification in cities with high surface humidity. According to the study, the fusion classification achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.10%, a kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.93, and an average accuracy (AA) of 92.86%. These results were better than the classification results obtained using Sentinel-2B MSI and Sentinel-1A SAR images separately.\n\nThe study also compared the fusion classification with other traditional classification algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), 2D convolutional neural networks, 3D convolutional neural networks, and hybridSN classification models. The results showed that the fusion classification algorithm with the support of full-band data achieved an OA of 98.87%, a KC of 0.98, and an AA of 98.36%. These results indicate that the fusion classification method using active-passive remote-sensing data is more effective in improving land-use classification accuracy compared to traditional methods."
