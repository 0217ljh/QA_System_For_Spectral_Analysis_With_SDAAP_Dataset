        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the NQR spectroscopy-based authentication method, combined with SVM classification, can be considered superior to traditional methods in detecting adulteration and verifying the authenticity of products. Traditional methods often require extensive sample preparation and may be limited in their ability to detect different types of integrity issues. In contrast, the NQR spectroscopy-based method is quantitative, non-invasive, and non-destructive, making it more efficient and convenient for analysis. It is sensitive to small deviations in the chemical structure of a product, allowing it to detect adulteration and changes in product integrity. Additionally, the manufacturer-specific watermarks generated by this method provide a unique identifier for each manufacturer, enabling accurate classification and authentication of products. The use of machine learning-based SVM classification further enhances the accuracy and reliability of the method. The evaluation of this approach on three products has shown promising results, with a typical classification accuracy of over 95%. Therefore, the NQR spectroscopy-based authentication method, combined with SVM classification, offers significant advantages over traditional methods in detecting adulteration and verifying the authenticity of products."
