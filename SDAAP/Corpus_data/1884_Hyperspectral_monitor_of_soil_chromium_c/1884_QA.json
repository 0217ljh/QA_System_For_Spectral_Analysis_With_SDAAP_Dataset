        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the discriminant models in the detection of soil heavy metal pollution is accuracy. The accuracy values for the DA-SVM, DA-KNN, and DA-DNN models were reported as 95.61%, 95.62%, and 96.25% respectively. The accuracy metric measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total samples. In this case, it indicates the percentage of correctly identified contaminated and non-contaminated soil samples. The accuracy values achieved in the study demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in detecting heavy metal pollution in soil."
