The model based on siETR achieved a high coefficient of determination of prediction (R-p(2) = 0.9444), indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual TP concentrations. This suggests that the model performed well in predicting TP concentration in water."

The siETR model achieved a high coefficient of determination of prediction (R-p(2) = 0.9444) and a low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP = 0.0731), indicating its strong predictive capabilities. The statistical analysis results also demonstrate that the siETR model is superior to other models in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness. Therefore, the siETR model shows promise as a rapid, highly sensitive, and pollution-free approach for determining TP concentration in water."
