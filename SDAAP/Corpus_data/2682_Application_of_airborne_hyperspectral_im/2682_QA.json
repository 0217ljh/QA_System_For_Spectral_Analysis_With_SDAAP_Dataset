        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to construct a CDOM retrieval model was the R2 (R-squared) value. The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the CDOM concentration that can be explained by the model. In the related study, the CDOM estimation model achieved an R2 value of 0.85, indicating that 85% of the variability in the CDOM concentration could be explained by the model.\n\nThe R2 value can range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 represents a perfect fit between the model and the observed data. Therefore, the R2 value can go up to 1, but it is important to note that a high R2 value does not necessarily mean that the model is accurate or reliable. Other metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and percent bias were also used to assess the model's performance and provide additional information about its accuracy and bias."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The input wavelength bands for the CDOM retrieval model were selected based on the evaluation of the best combination of input wavelength bands and the CDOM absorption coefficient at various wavelengths. The study used airborne hyperspectral reflectance data and a machine learning model, specifically random forest, to determine the optimal combination of wavelength bands. The researchers considered seven sampling events for airborne hyperspectral imagery and CDOM absorption coefficient data from 350 nm to 440 nm over two years (2016-2017). By analyzing the performance of the model using different combinations of reflectance bands, they identified that the best combination for CDOM estimation was achieved using three reflectance bands: 475, 497, and 660 nm."
