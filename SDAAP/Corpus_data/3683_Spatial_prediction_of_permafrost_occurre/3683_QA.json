Set 1: This set included surface reflectance from atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2A spectral bands, elevation, and slope parameters.\n\n2. Set 2: This set included mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and potential incoming solar radiation (PISR)."

        "Output": "Yes, the use of spectral reflectance, elevation, and slope parameters as input data in machine learning algorithms can be considered superior to traditional methods for estimating permafrost distribution in the remote and data-scarce Himalayan region. The related study states that the accuracy assessment results are more optimistic towards models developed using these input data sets. Additionally, 5 out of 8 models agree that around 60% of the total area under observation is highly likely to contain permafrost, indicating a reasonable agreement in the spatial extent of permafrost occurrence. This congruence in outputs, despite the use of different machine learning algorithms and separate sets of input data, establishes reliability in the application of machine learning models for the preliminary estimation of permafrost distribution in the Himalayan region."
