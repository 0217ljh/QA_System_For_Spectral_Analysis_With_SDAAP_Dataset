        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models for soybean yield prediction is the coefficient of determination (r^2). This metric measures the proportion of the variability in the yield data that can be explained by the models. \n\nAccording to the study, the random forest (RF) models using Sentinel-2 spectral data can explain up to 45% of the out-of-sample yield variability from 2017 to 2018 (r^2 = 0.45). On the other hand, the RF models using Landsat spectral data can explain up to 43% of the yield variability across the longer period of 2008-2018. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric, r^2, can explain a significant portion of the yield variability in the study, ranging from 43% to 45% depending on the specific model and data used."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, improvements were made to the Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) approach for soybean yield prediction. These improvements included the use of harmonic regressions to estimate the peak vegetation index (VI) and a VI observation 30 days later. Additionally, the sole weather covariate used in the new SCYM model was August rainfall. These modifications resulted in an improved explained variance of 0.27 at the 30 m scale and provided a new, parsimonious model for soybean yield estimation."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is possible to apply the spectral feature processing methods used in the study to other crops for yield prediction using machine learning models. The study compared random forest (RF) implementations using Sentinel-2 and Landsat spectral data for soybean yield prediction. The results showed that these models were able to explain a significant portion of yield variability. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that similar spectral feature processing methods could be applied to other crops to predict their yield using machine learning models."
