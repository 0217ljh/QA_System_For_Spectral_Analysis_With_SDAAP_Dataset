This means that the machine learning algorithm was able to accurately detect the presence of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma in 87% of symptomatic individuals, while maintaining a specificity of 98%. This performance was compared to the current best clinical screening test, which had a sensitivity of 84% at 98% specificity using measurements of cancer antigen 125 and transvaginal ultrasonography."
