This pretreatment involved denoising the background information and normalizing the data to improve the signal-to-background ratio and experimental reliability.\n\nNext, the RF algorithm was applied to select 10 characteristic spectral lines from the pretreated LIBS data. These selected spectral lines were used as input vectors for both the MLP and SVM models.\n\nThe MLP and SVM models were then trained using the selected spectral lines as input and the known origin labels of the ginseng samples. The models learned to classify the ginseng samples based on the patterns in the selected spectral lines.\n\nFinally, the discrimination accuracy rates of the RF-MLP and RF-SVM models were evaluated. The experimental results showed that the discrimination accuracy rate of the RF-MLP model was slightly higher at 99.75% compared to the RF-SVM model at 99.5%. Additionally, it was"
