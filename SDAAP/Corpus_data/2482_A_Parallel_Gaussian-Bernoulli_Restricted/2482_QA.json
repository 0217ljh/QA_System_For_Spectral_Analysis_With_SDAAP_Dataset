        "Output": "The proposed approach using Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GBRBMs) aims to improve classification performance in hyperspectral image classification compared to traditional classifiers by employing several GBRBMs with different hidden layers to extract deep features from the images. These deep features are nonlinear and local invariant, allowing for more accurate and robust classification. Additionally, the GBRBMs can extract these deep features in an unsupervised way, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. Furthermore, the use of GPU can significantly reduce the prediction time, making the classification process more efficient. Overall, the combination of deep feature extraction and improved computational efficiency leads to superior performance compared to traditional classifiers."
