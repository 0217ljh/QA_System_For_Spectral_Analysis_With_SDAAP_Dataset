        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the proposed NSCI method can be considered superior to traditional methods for the rapid and simple detection of Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) in wheat. The traditional methods for FDK detection are described as time-consuming and laborious, while the NSCI method offers a simple and low-cost alternative. The NSCI method analyzes spectra in the wavelength range 350-2500 nm and uses spectral reflectance and its first derivative to classify wheat kernels. The method achieves a high detection accuracy of 0.97, with a specificity of 0.99 and a sensitivity of 0.93. Additionally, the NSCI method has a training time of only 15.07 seconds. Compared to other spectral indexes and machine learning methods, the NSCI method is more balanced in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The threshold used in the NSCI method can also be adjusted to meet different practical needs in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity. Furthermore, the NSCI method has shown promising results when applied to kernel hyperspectral data in another year. Overall, the NSCI method has the potential to provide a rapid and simple detection of FDK in wheat, making it superior to traditional methods."
