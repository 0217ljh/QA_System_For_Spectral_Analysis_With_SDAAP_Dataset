        "Output": "Convolutional neural (CNN) and recurrent neural (RNN) networks were used in combination with confocal laser Raman spectroscopy to identify seal authenticity. The networks were trained using a dataset of 536 spectral samples from 16 different brands of red stamp-pad ink. To increase the dataset size, 53,600 amplification data samples were generated by adding noise. The joint neural network, consisting of both CNN and RNN, was found to have superior classification performance compared to other methods such as partial least squares (PLS) discriminant and common CNN. The network achieved a recognition rate of 100% for different brands and aging of the three types of stamp-pad inks: photosensitive, atomic, and common."

The past study states that the joint neural network has significant classification performance compared to partial least squares (PLS) discriminant and common CNN. Additionally, the recognition rate for different brands and aging reached 100% using this method."
