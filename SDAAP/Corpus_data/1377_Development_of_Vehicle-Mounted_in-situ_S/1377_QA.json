The test results showed that the correlation coefficient (R) between the measured value of soil nutrients content using the detector and the laboratory standard test method were all above 0.90.

        "Output": "In the development of the vehicle-mounted in-situ soil parameters detector, a machine learning model was used specifically for measuring soil total nitrogen. The model was based on an extreme learning machine algorithm and utilized near-infrared (NIR) diffuse reflection technology. \n\nTo improve the real-time measurement accuracy, the model was trained using seven sensitive wavelengths (1 070, 1 130, 1 245, 1 375, 1 450, 1 550, 1 680 nm) that were found to be effective in detecting soil nutrient parameters. These wavelengths were selected based on their ability to provide accurate and reliable measurements of soil total nitrogen.\n\nThe machine learning model was developed to analyze the reflectance values obtained from the detector at these seven sensitive wavelengths. By comparing these values with known reflectance values from a MATRIX-I type Fourier spectrum analyzer, the model was able to calculate the correlation coefficient (R) between the two sets of data.\n\nThe test results showed that the machine learning model achieved a maximum correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9978 and an average correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9278."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the spectral feature processing methods used in the development of the vehicle-mounted in-situ soil parameters detector can be considered superior to traditional methods for rapid and high-accuracy collection of farmland soil nutrients information. The detector used near-infrared (NIR) diffuse reflection and a soil total nitrogen measurement extreme learning machine model consisting of seven sensitive wavelengths to improve the real-time measurement accuracy. The detector also utilized a tungsten halogen light source with better illumination stability, which improved the adaptability of the instrument to working conditions. The test results showed that the detector had higher detection accuracy, with correlation coefficients (R) between the measured values of soil nutrients content using the detector and the laboratory standard test method all above 0.90. Therefore, the spectral feature processing methods used in the development of the detector provide a more efficient and accurate approach for collecting farmland soil nutrients information compared to traditional methods."
