        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study evaluated the influence of variable selection, machine learning, and calibration transfer methods on the detection performance of hyperspectral imaging with chemometric methods for detecting Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) on oilseed rape leaves by building four discriminant models using full spectra. These models included partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), soft independent modeling of class analogies (SIMCA), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Additionally, PLS-DA and SVM models were built using optimal wavelengths selected by different methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) loadings, second derivative spectra, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), and successive projections algorithm (SPA). The study found that the optimal wavelengths selected for each sample set varied depending on the method used, but PCA loadings and second derivative spectra showed similarity across different sample sets. The study also applied direct standardization (DS) to reduce spectral differences among different sample sets. Overall, the study demonstrated that using hyperspectral imaging with chemometrics for plant disease detection can be efficient and can aid in the selection of optimal variable selection, machine learning, and calibration transfer methods for fast and accurate detection of Sclerotinia stem rot on oilseed rape leaves."
