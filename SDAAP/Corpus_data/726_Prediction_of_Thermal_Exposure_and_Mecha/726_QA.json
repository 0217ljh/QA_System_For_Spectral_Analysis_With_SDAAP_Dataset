The researchers used Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data from both mid-IR (MIR) and near-IR (NIR) ranges to measure molecular changes in the cured epoxy resin samples. \n\nFor the film samples, MIR-FTIR spectroscopy was used to detect oxidation, chain-scission, and dehydration in the FTIR spectra, indicating thermal degradation. Data processing techniques were then applied to extract molecular information from the NIR range of the bulk samples. Although only minor changes in the FTIR spectra of the bulk samples could be detected using NIR spectroscopy, the researchers were able to extract relevant information using data processing techniques.\n\nThe extracted molecular information from the NIR range was then used to train an artificial neural network, which served as the degradation model. This model was capable of accurately predicting the time, temperature, and residual strength of the polymer, even though the changes due to thermal exposure were small.\n\nTherefore, by combining FTIR spectroscopy, data processing, and artificial neural networks, the researchers were able to develop a predictive model for the mechanical properties, thermal exposure time, and temperature of the"

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the approach of using FTIR-spectroscopy, data processing, and artificial neural networks can be considered superior to traditional methods in accurately predicting the mechanical properties, thermal exposure time, and temperature of epoxy resin. Traditional methods for detecting thermal degradation in epoxy resins and composites are limited to severe thermal damage and do not provide accurate predictions for short-time thermal exposure or the history of thermally degraded polymers. However, the approach described in the related study utilizes FTIR-spectroscopy to measure molecular changes in the resin, data processing techniques to extract molecular information, and artificial neural networks to train a degradation model. This approach allows for accurate predictions of the mechanical properties, thermal exposure time, and temperature of the epoxy resin, even for minor changes due to thermal exposure. Therefore, it can be considered superior to traditional methods in accurately predicting these parameters."
