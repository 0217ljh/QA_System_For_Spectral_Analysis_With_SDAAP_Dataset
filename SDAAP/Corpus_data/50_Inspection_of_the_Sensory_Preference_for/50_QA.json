        "Output": "The metric chosen to classify the sensory preference for grading kyo-ho table grape accoding to the internal qualities of the fruit was the principal component of transmittance spectra of table grape. The extreme learning machine combined with principal component analysis (PCA-ELM) model was used for classification. The accuracy of this model was reported to be 78.7%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers compared the sensory preference of customers with the principal component of transmittance spectra of the grape using three nonlinear classification methods. They investigated the relationship between the sensory preference and the principal component of transmittance spectra by employing the extreme learning machine combined with principal component analysis (PCA-ELM) model. This model obtained the best performance with a classification accuracy of 78.7%."

        "instruction": "Can the transmission spectra method be used to accurately measure the internal qualities of kyo-ho table grape and predict the sensory preference of consumers, as compared to traditional methods?",
        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the transmission spectra method can be used to accurately measure the internal qualities of kyo-ho table grape and predict the sensory preference of consumers. The transmission spectra had a better capacity to characterize the internal information of grape berries. The partial least square (PLS) model was optimized using the transmission spectra to measure sugar content (SC) and total acidity (TA) with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.598% brix and 0.048 g/L, respectively. Additionally, a nonlinear classification method, the extreme learning machine combined with principal component analysis (PCA-ELM) model, achieved the best performance in predicting the sensory preference of customers with a classification accuracy of 78.7%. Therefore, the transmission spectra method can be considered as an effective alternative to traditional methods for measuring internal qualities and predicting sensory preference in kyo-ho table grapes."
