        "Output": "The proposed COD prediction model based on UV-Vis spectrometry and CNN improves the accuracy of water quality COD detection in several ways:\n\n1. Utilization of all ultraviolet and visible wavelengths: Unlike the traditional method that uses a specific wavelength (254 nm) to measure COD, this model makes full use of the absorbance of all ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. This approach avoids information loss caused by using specific wavelengths and allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the composition of pollutants.\n\n2. Shallow CNN with convolutional layers: The model is constructed based on a shallow CNN architecture, which uses convolutional layers with different step lengths instead of traditional pooling layers. This design reduces computation and enhances the capture of spectral feature peaks. By extracting features from the input data, the CNN improves the model's ability to identify and analyze patterns in the spectral information.\n\n3. Reduced reliance on pre-processing methods: The powerful feature extraction capability of the CNN reduces the reliance on pre-processing methods. This means that the model can directly analyze the raw spectral data without the need for extensive data manipulation or transformation. By eliminating the need for complex pre-processing steps, the model simplifies the analysis process and improves the utilization of spectral information.\n\n4. Better fitting results and accuracy: Experimental results have shown that the"
