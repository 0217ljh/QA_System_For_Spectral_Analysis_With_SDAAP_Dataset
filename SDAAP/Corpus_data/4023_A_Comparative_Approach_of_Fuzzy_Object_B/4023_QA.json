        "Output": "The efficiency of the semiautomated fuzzy object-based image analysis (fuzzy OBIA) was found to be superior to the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms in evaluating crop residue cover (CRC) and tillage intensity. The study compared the performance of these three methods using spectral images from two remotely sensed platforms: the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel-2 satellite.\n\nFor the evaluation of CRC and tillage intensity based on multispectral Sentinel-2 images, the fuzzy OBIA method achieved an overall accuracy of 0.920 and Cohen's kappa of 0.874. These results surpassed the performance of the SVM and ANN algorithms.\n\nSimilarly, when using RGB images from the UAV, the fuzzy OBIA method achieved an overall accuracy of 0.860 and Cohen's kappa of 0.779 for the classification of tillage intensity. Again, these results outperformed the SVM and ANN algorithms.\n\nOverall, the semiautomated fuzzy OBIA method demonstrated higher efficiency and accuracy in evaluating CRC and classifying tillage intensity compared to the machine learning algorithms SVM and ANN. This suggests that fuzzy OBIA has the potential to replace or complement traditional field techniques for assessing tillage practices and estimating CRC."
