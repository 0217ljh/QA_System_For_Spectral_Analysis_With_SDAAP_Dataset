        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction capability of the machine learning models is the r squared value. The r squared value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (phenotypic variance in this case) that can be explained by the independent variables (multispectral data). \n\nAccording to the related study, the trained models were able to explain a considerable degree of phenotypic variance with good accuracy. The r squared values obtained for the prediction of grain yield, protein content, vitreousness, and test weight were 0.84, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.61, respectively. \n\nTherefore, the machine learning models were able to explain a significant portion of the phenotypic variance, indicating a strong predictive capability for these quality traits."

        "Output": "The use of high-resolution spectral data acquired by a multispectral camera mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is more efficient and accurate compared to traditional methods in predicting grain yield and important quality traits in breeding micro-plots. Traditional methods for evaluating quality traits post-harvest are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and require expensive equipment. In contrast, the use of UAV-mounted multispectral cameras allows for the collection of high-resolution spectral data quickly and easily.\n\nBy analyzing the multispectral image data with machine learning (ML) models, breeders can predict grain yield and quality traits before harvest, optimizing resource allocation. The related study used an 11-band multispectral camera on a UAV to acquire data for 34 cultivars and 16 environments. The ML models developed using this data showed good prediction capability.\n\nWhen tested, the trained models explained a considerable degree of phenotypic variance with good accuracy. The r squared values for grain yield, protein content, vitreousness, and test weight were 0.84, 0.69, 0.64, and 0.61, respectively. The normalized root mean squared errors were 0.17, 0.07, 0.14, and 0.03 for the"
