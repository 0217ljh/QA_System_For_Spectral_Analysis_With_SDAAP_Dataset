        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the trained models in this study is the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the observed SSC data that can be explained by the predicted SSC values from the models. \n\nIn this study, the R-2 values were found to be greater than 0.9 for Landsat 4-5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 sensors, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and observed SSC values."
