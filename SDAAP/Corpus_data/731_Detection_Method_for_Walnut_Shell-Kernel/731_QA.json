        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, it can be inferred that the proposed method using Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is superior to traditional methods for detecting the accuracy of walnut shell-kernel separation. The classification accuracy of the support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models using this method was reported to be 97.78% and 97.11% respectively. This suggests that the NIR spectroscopy-based method is highly accurate in distinguishing between walnut shell, kernel, and chimera materials, making it a reliable approach for detecting the accuracy of walnut shell-kernel separation."
