        "input": "",
        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has not been widely explored for predicting the forage quality of many warm-season legumes. However, the research conducted in the related study suggests that NIRS, when combined with machine learning techniques such as partial least square (PLS), support vector machine (SVM), and Gaussian processes (GP), can be effective in predicting forage quality parameters.\n\nThe related study found that PLS consistently performed best at calibrating all forage quality parameters in both species-based and global models. SVM provided the most accurate predictions for guar and soybean crops, as well as global models. Both SVM and PLS performed better for tepary bean and pigeon pea forages.\n\nThe global modeling approach, which developed a single model for all five crops, yielded sufficient accuracy in predicting crude protein (CP) of the different legumes. However, the accuracy of predictions of in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) for the different legumes varied.\n\nOverall, the results suggest that NIRS, combined with machine learning techniques, can be a promising method for predicting forage quality parameters of warm-season legumes. However, further attention and research are needed to explore its potential in different NIRS-based applications."
