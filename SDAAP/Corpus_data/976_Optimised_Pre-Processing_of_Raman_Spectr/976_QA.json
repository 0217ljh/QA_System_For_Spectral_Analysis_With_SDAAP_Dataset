        "Output": "No. Based on the information provided in the related study, it is not explicitly stated whether the optimized pre-processing of human serum Raman spectra using high-performance computing (HPC) can be applied to other spectroscopic methods for colorectal cancer detection. The related study focuses specifically on the use of HPC to optimize pre-processing for Raman spectroscopy. However, it does mention providing tips/recommendations for pre-processing optimization without the use of HPC, which suggests that some of the findings and recommendations may be applicable to other spectroscopic methods. Further research or clarification would be needed to determine the extent to which the optimized pre-processing methods can be applied to other spectroscopic techniques for colorectal cancer detection."
