        "Output": "The text does not explicitly mention the specific metric chosen to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the models. However, it does state that the predictive accuracy was \"good and significantly correlated\" with the laboratory-measured freshly cut lettuce leaves, with an R-2 value greater than or equal to 0.94. The R-2 value, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a commonly used metric to assess the goodness of fit of a regression model. It measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. In this case, the R-2 value of 0.94 indicates a strong correlation between the predicted and actual nutrient contents of the aquaponically grown lettuce."

        "Output": "Yes, the developed machine learning models using spectroscopic methods can be considered superior to traditional methods for estimating the nutrient contents of aquaponically grown lettuce. The study mentions that good and significantly correlated predictive accuracy was obtained with R-2 values greater than or equal to 0.94 when comparing the machine learning models with laboratory-measured freshly cut lettuce leaves. This indicates that the machine learning models using spectroscopic methods are highly accurate in estimating the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents of aquaponically grown lettuce. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a pathway toward automatic nutrient estimation, making aquaponics more intelligent and adopting precision agriculture technology."
