        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen for estimating ecosystem respiration (RE)  at the field scale is the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (RE) that can be explained by the independent variables (canopy spectral data, agronomic indicators, agrometeorological and soil data). The RMSE value represents the average difference between the predicted RE values and the actual observed values.\n\nThe study found that the developed remote sensing model (LT1-NIRV) had an R2 value ranging from 0.60 to 0.64 and an RMSE value ranging from 285.98 to 316.19 mg m-2 h-1. This indicates that the model can explain approximately 60-64% of the variance in RE and has an average prediction error of 285.98-316.19 mg m-2 h-1.\n\nFor the machine learning (ML) models, the XGBoost model performed the best with an R2 value of 0.88 and an RMSE value of 172.70 mg m-2 h-1."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The LT1-NIRV remote sensing model, which is a semiempirical model based on Lloyd and Taylor, was developed to estimate ecosystem respiration (RE) at the field scale. The study found that this model had a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.60 to 0.64 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranging from 285.98 to 316.19 mg m-2 h-1. These results indicate that the LT1-NIRV model provides estimates of RE with a small margin of error. \n\nIn comparison to traditional methods, such as the laborious chamber method, the LT1-NIRV remote sensing model offers a more efficient and non-invasive approach to estimate RE. Traditional methods require manual measurements in the plot region, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. On the other hand, the LT1-NIRV model utilizes multispectral data acquired by a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a multispectral camera. This allows for the collection of canopy spectral data of wheat during each RE test experiment, providing a more comprehensive and timely assessment of RE."
