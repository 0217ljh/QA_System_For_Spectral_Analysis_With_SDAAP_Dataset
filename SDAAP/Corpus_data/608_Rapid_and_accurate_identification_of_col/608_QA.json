        "input": "",
        "Output": "The CNN model proposed in this work has been found to have superior feature extraction ability compared to traditional machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and support vector machine. Additionally, the trained CNN model demonstrates much better classification performance for spectral data of new individuals. This suggests that the CNN model combined with Raman spectroscopy can be an effective auxiliary tool for the early diagnosis of colon cancer."
