This setup was tested in an operational environment and was designed to be non-invasive, allowing it to be applied during dialysis sessions. They trained a support vector machine and an artificial neural network using a dataset of spectra to predict hematocrit and oxygen saturation. The results of different machine learning algorithms were compared, and it was concluded that the support vector machine was the best technique for predicting hematocrit and oxygen saturation."
