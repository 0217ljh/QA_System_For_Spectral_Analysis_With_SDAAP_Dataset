        "Output": "Texture variables, including second-order and first-order textural features, were used in the classification process to aid in the detection of built-up and topographic features. Additionally, tasseled cap spectral indices of greenness, brightness, and wetness were derived from the Landsat data and included in the analysis."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the classification accuracy of land use/land cover in desert landscapes is the kappa coefficient (\u9b4f). The kappa coefficient measures the agreement between the predicted classifications and the actual classifications, taking into account the agreement that could occur by chance. \n\nThe related study states that the kappa coefficient attained values over 0.83. This indicates a high level of agreement between the predicted classifications and the actual classifications. The kappa coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a higher level of agreement. Therefore, a kappa coefficient of over 0.83 suggests a strong level of accuracy in the classification of land use/land cover in desert landscapes using the evaluated machine-learning ensemble classifiers."

        "Output": "The machine-learning ensemble classifiers, random forests and boosted artificial neural networks, perform well in the classification of land use/land cover in desert landscapes using remotely sensed data. The study found that both classifiers produced accurate land-cover classifications, with and without integrating spectral data with ancillary data. The overall accuracy of the classifications exceeded 85%, and the kappa coefficient attained values over 0.83. \n\nThe integration of ancillary data improved the performance of the boosted artificial neural networks by approximately 5% and the random forests by 9%. While random forests showed overall higher accuracy, boosted artificial neural networks demonstrated better generalization ability and lower overfitting tendencies. \n\nThese results suggest that applying ensemble methods to integrated spectral and ancillary data of similar desert landscapes can achieve high classification accuracies."

The related study evaluated the performance of two machine-learning ensemble classifiers (random forests and boosted artificial neural networks) in classifying land-use/land-cover categories in a desert landscape. The evaluation was based on the accuracy of classification of remotely sensed data, with and without integration of ancillary data. The results showed that both ensemble methods produced accurate land-cover classifications, with and without integrating spectral data with ancillary data. "
