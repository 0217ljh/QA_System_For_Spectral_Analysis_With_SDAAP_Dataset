        "Output": "The hybrid CNC retrieval model for satellite imaging spectroscopy data is shown to provide reliable estimates of canopy nitrogen content (CNC) from satellite images for agricultural monitoring applications. The model combines physically-based models with machine learning regression algorithms and active learning techniques to improve the accuracy of CNC retrieval.\n\nCompared to traditional methods, the hybrid model offers several advantages. Firstly, it utilizes satellite imaging spectroscopy data, which provides contiguous visible-to-shortwave infrared spectral data. This allows for a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of vegetation traits, including CNC. Traditional methods may not have access to such high-resolution spectral data.\n\nSecondly, the hybrid model incorporates dimensionality reduction techniques to deal with collinearity in the data. This helps to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of CNC estimates. Traditional methods may not have this capability, leading to less precise results.\n\nThirdly, the model incorporates an active learning technique in combination with Gaussian process regression (GPR) to fine-tune the training dataset using in-field collected data. This iterative process helps to improve the model's performance and adaptability to different environments. Traditional methods may not have this adaptive learning capability.\n\nLastly, the hybrid model includes non-vegetated spectra to account for spectral heterogeneity in the image. This allows the model to accurately estimate CNC"
