Different periods: The LS-SVM method was used to estimate winter wheat LAI at different time periods.\n\n3. Different nitrogenous fertilizer conditions: The LS-SVM method was used to estimate winter wheat LAI under different nitrogenous fertilizer conditions.\n\n4. Different water conditions: The LS-SVM method was used to estimate winter wheat LAI under different water conditions."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the findings of the study, the LS-SVM method can be considered superior to the traditional NDVI model in estimating winter wheat LAI using hyperspectral data. The LS-SVM method yielded higher determination coefficient and lower RMSE values compared to the NDVI model in each experiment. Additionally, the LS-SVM model showed good stability under different conditions such as different plant type cultivars, different nitrogenous fertilizer, and different water conditions. Therefore, the LS-SVM method has high accuracy for learning and considerable universality for estimating LAI of winter wheat using hyperspectral data."
