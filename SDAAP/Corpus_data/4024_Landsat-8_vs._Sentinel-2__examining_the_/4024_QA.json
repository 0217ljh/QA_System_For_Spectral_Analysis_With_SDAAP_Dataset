Classification of all Sentinel-2 bands, including those common to Landsat-8, resulted in an overall accuracy that was 5% and 4% better than Landsat-8.\n\n2. The combination of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 red-edge bands improved the overall accuracy by 4% compared to Landsat-8 alone.\n\n3. Classification of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands alone produced better results compared to Landsat-8.\n\n4. The other Sentinel-2 bands, when classified individually, produced comparable results to Landsat-8.\n\nThese results demonstrate the added value of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands and suggest the benefits of using multi-sensoral approaches for LULC mapping in West Africa."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study demonstrated the added value of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands in improving land use and land cover (LULC) mapping in rural Burkina Faso compared to Landsat-8 alone by conducting a classification analysis using three machine-learning algorithms. The results showed that the classification of all Sentinel-2 bands, including the red-edge bands, as well as the classification of Sentinel-2 bands common to Landsat-8, produced overall accuracy that was 5% and 4% better than Landsat-8 alone, respectively. Additionally, the combination of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 red-edge bands resulted in a 4% accuracy improvement over Landsat-8 alone. Furthermore, the classification of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands alone produced better and comparable results to Landsat-8 and the other Sentinel-2 bands, respectively. These findings highlight the enhanced capabilities of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands in improving LULC mapping and support the use of multi-sensoral approaches in West Africa."
