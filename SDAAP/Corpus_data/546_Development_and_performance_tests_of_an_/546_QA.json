        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the TN concentration detector was the coefficient of determination (R-2). The R-2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the TN concentration that can be explained by the ELM estimation model. In this case, the R-2 value for the laboratory calibration experiments was 0.90, indicating that 90% of the variance in the TN concentration could be explained by the model. The validation R-2 value was 0.82, indicating that the model could explain 82% of the variance in the TN concentration in new samples. Therefore, the R-2 metric was used to assess the accuracy and precision of the detector's TN concentration measurements."

        "Output": "The developed TN concentration detector based on near-infrared spectroscopy exhibits stable performance, high precision, and high accuracy compared to traditional methods.\n\nIn terms of stability, the detector showed stable performance in both laboratory and field tests. This indicates that the detector is reliable and consistent in providing TN concentration readings.\n\nRegarding precision, the laboratory calibration and validation experiments demonstrated that the detector had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.90 for the TN concentration estimation model. This indicates a strong correlation between the detector's readings and the actual TN concentration values. Additionally, the validation R-2 of 0.82 further supports the precision of the detector.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the correlation coefficients between standard laboratory measurements and the detector were 0.82 in field operation and 0.91 in the laboratory. These high correlation coefficients indicate that the detector's readings closely align with the measurements obtained through traditional methods. Therefore, the detector can accurately quantify TN concentration in real-time.\n\nOverall, the developed TN concentration detector based on near-infrared spectroscopy outperforms traditional methods in terms of stability, precision, and accuracy."
