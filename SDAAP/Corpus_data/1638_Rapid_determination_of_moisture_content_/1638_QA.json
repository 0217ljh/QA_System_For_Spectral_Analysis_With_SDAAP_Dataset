        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction model was the R-2 value, also known as the coefficient of determination. The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (moisture content) that can be explained by the independent variables (spectral data). \n\nThe accuracy of the prediction model was quite high, with an R-2 value of 0.9604 for the validation dataset and 0.9660 for the test dataset. This indicates that approximately 96% of the variance in the moisture content can be explained by the spectral data. Additionally, the root mean square error for the moisture prediction was 3.80, which suggests that the model's predictions were relatively close to the actual moisture content values. Overall, the model demonstrated excellent accuracy in predicting the moisture content of multi-source solid waste."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combined model developed in the related study was found to be highly efficient in predicting the moisture content of multi-source solid waste compared to traditional methods. The R-2 values of the validation and test datasets reached 0.9604 and 0.9660, respectively, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual moisture content. Additionally, the root mean square error for the moisture prediction was 3.80, which suggests a relatively small margin of error in the predictions. These results demonstrate that the combined model can rapidly and accurately measure the moisture content of solid waste, surpassing the limitations of traditional methods that are time-consuming, cumbersome, and destructive to samples."
