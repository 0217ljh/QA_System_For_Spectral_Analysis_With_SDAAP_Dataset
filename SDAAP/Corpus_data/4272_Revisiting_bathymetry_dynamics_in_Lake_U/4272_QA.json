        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the developed intelligent model is the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The R-2 value ranges from 0.8 to 0.9, indicating a strong correlation between water depth and surface reflectance. The RMSE values range from 7.8 to 17.9 cm, which quantifies the average difference between the predicted water depth and the actual water depth. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the relationship between water depth and surface reflectance, indicating the accuracy of the model in estimating water depth based on satellite imagery and in-situ data."
