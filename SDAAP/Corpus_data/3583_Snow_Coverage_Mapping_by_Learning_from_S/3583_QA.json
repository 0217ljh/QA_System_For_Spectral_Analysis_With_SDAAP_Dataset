        "Output": "The U-Net-based deep-learning classifier with the four informative spectral bands outperforms the existing rule-based Sen2Cor product for snow mapping in terms of accuracy and suitability. The experimental results show that both conventional machine-learning and advanced deep-learning methods significantly outperform the Sen2Cor product. Additionally, the U-Net model generally outperforms the random forest model since it incorporates both spectral and spatial information through convolution operations. Therefore, the U-Net-based deep-learning classifier with the four informative spectral bands is considered suitable for snow coverage mapping."
