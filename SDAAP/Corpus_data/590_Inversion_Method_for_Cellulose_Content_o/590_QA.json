        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction model for cellulose content in rice stems is the coefficient of determination (RP). The coefficient of determination measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (cellulose content) that can be explained by the independent variables (characteristic wavelengths). \n\nThe coefficient of determination (RP) of the test set is reported to be 0.880. This means that approximately 88% of the variance in the cellulose content can be explained by the selected characteristic wavelengths. "

        "Output": "Yes, the SaDEGWO optimized epsilon SVR model, constructed using the SiPLS-IRIV method and spectral pretreatment with the SNV-CWT method, can be used as a superior alternative to traditional methods for predicting cellulose content in rice stems using a near-infrared spectral inversion model. The model has been shown to have the highest accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (RP) of 0.880 and a root-mean-square error (RMSEP) of 15.22 mg.g(-1). This indicates that the model has good predictive ability and can provide a reliable prediction of cellulose content in rice stems."
