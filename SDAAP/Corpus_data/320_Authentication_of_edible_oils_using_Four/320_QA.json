        "input": "",
        "Output": "FTIR spectroscopy can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for discriminating between different types of edible oils and detecting adulterants. The past study analyzed ninety-seven edible oil samples from twenty plant-based varieties using FTIR spectroscopy and four main types of pattern recognition methods. The results showed that edible oils from different oil groups could be reliably discriminated using FTIR spectroscopy. Additionally, adulteration of edible oils by other oils that were not in the same group could be detected at low concentration levels. This suggests that FTIR spectroscopy has the capability to accurately discriminate between different types of edible oils and detect adulterants, making it a superior method compared to traditional methods."
