        "input": "",
        "Output": "The proposed modification of the weighted k-nearest neighbour method contributes to the classification of dental tissue into healthy and unhealthy classes using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy by providing class boundaries and the probability of class membership during the verification stage. \n\nIn this methodology, the difference between the healthy and unhealthy teeth reflectance spectra in the infrared and visible ranges is used for signal processing. Selected features associated with observed spectra are then used for machine learning classification. \n\nDuring the learning stage, the method utilizes the experience of an expert in stomatology to train the classification model. The weighted k-nearest neighbour method assigns weights to the nearest neighbours based on their proximity to the test sample. This modification helps in determining the class boundaries more accurately and estimating the probability of class membership for each dental tissue measurement.\n\nBy incorporating this modification, the accuracy of the classification process reached 95.4%. This suggests that the proposed modification of the weighted k-nearest neighbour method improves the effectiveness of classifying dental tissue into healthy and unhealthy classes using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy."
