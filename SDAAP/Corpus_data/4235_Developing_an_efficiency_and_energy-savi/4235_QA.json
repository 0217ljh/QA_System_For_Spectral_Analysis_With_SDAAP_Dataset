        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the N nutrition index optimized algorithm (NNIOA) was the R-squared value. The R-squared value is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (in this case, plant dry matter and plant N accumulation) that can be explained by the independent variables (multi-variate information). \n\nIn terms of regulating the deficient, optimal, and excessive N status, the NNIOA was able to efficiently adjust the N fertilizers. It achieved up-adjustment of N fertilizers by 54.17% for deficient N status, fine-adjustment by 0.67% for optimal N status, and downward-adjustment by 18.18% for excessive N status. This indicates that the NNIOA was able to effectively regulate and optimize the N status based on the multi-source data."

The machine learning methods used were random forest (RF), which performed the best for plant dry matter and plant N accumulation estimation with R-2 values of 0.78 and 0.83, respectively. These machine learning methods were employed to analyze and interpret the data collected from UAV multi-spectral images, plant sampling, weather, and field management. By utilizing these methods, the researchers were able to develop an efficient and energy-saving N management strategy for guiding in-season N application in winter wheat production."
