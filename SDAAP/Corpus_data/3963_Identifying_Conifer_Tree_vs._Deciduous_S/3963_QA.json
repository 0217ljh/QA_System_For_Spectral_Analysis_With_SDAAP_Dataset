        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the lidar-derived structural metrics can accurately predict areas of deciduous shrub establishment and classify deciduous and conifer trees in boreal peatlands. The related study found that the use of lidar-derived metrics had a 92% accuracy in identifying areas of deciduous shrub establishment and a 71% accuracy in classifying deciduous and conifer trees. This suggests that spectroscopic methods, such as lidar, are superior to traditional methods for assessing post-disturbance vegetation regeneration in terms of accuracy and precision."
