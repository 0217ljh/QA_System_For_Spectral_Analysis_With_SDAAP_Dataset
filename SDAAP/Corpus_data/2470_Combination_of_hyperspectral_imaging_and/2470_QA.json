        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were utilized to analyze the spectral patterns of MSW samples and classify the inorganic and organic components. The researchers used a combination of hyperspectral imaging and machine learning techniques to achieve this. \n\nFirst, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to abstract crucial information from the spectral patterns of the MSW samples. PCA is a statistical technique that reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most important information. It helps to identify the key spectral features that differentiate between different components in the MSW samples.\n\nNext, artificial neural network (ANN) models were employed for classification and regression tasks. ANN is a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes or \"neurons\" that process and transmit information. The ANN models were trained using the spectral data obtained from the MSW samples, along with the known composition of the samples.\n\nThe trained ANN models were then used to classify the inorganic and organic components of the MSW samples based on their spectral patterns. The models were able to accurately identify the inorganic components with a high F1 scoring accuracy of nearly 100%. "
