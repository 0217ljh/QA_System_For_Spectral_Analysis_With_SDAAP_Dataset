        "input": "",
        "Output": "The fusion learning model improved the classification accuracy of rock spectral features compared to traditional methods by combining the results of multiple machine learning models. In the study, three machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used individually to classify the rock spectra. \n\nHowever, each individual model had its limitations. Random Forest was prone to overfitting when dealing with large amounts of noisy data. K-Nearest Neighbor required considering every sample, which could be computationally expensive when dealing with large datasets. Support Vector Machine aimed to improve classification accuracy but did not consider the results of the other models.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, a fusion learning model was proposed. The fusion learning model used a hard voting method to combine the classification results of RF, KNN, and SVM. By selecting the classification result with the most votes, the fusion learning model reduced the occurrence of overfitting and improved the overall accuracy of the classification.\n\nThe experimental results showed that the fusion learning model achieved a classification accuracy of 99.17%, which was higher than the individual models. This demonstrated that the fusion learning model was feasible, accurate, and efficient in automatically classifying rock spectral features."
