        "input": "",
        "Output": "Based on the related study, it is not possible to directly compare the accuracy and reliability of Raman spectroscopy with traditional methods for classifying edible oils based on their degree of unsaturation. The related study primarily focuses on the challenges faced in classifying edible oils using Raman spectroscopy due to uncontrolled variability from different sources and seasons. It mentions that the variability within one class of edible oils can be comparable to the differences between different varieties of edible oils, making it difficult to construct a reliable classification model."
