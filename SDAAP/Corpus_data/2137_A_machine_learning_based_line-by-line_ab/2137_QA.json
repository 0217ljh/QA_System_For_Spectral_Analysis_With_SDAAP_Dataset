        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the text, it is not explicitly stated whether the developed machine learning-based method for predicting CO2 absorption coefficients can be applied to other greenhouse gases in space-based remote sensing applications. The text specifically mentions the development of a prediction model for CO2 in the 1.6 \u6e2dm spectral band and its application to simulate measured spectra from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO)-2 mission. However, it does not mention the application of the method to other greenhouse gases. Therefore, it is unclear whether the method can be directly applied to other greenhouse gases or if further research and development would be required."
