        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the predictive models In the research on the rapid nondestructive detection of classification and adulteration of Mengding Mountain green tea is accuracy for the classification task and R2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean square error) for the quantitative analysis task.\n\nFor the classification task, the accuracy metric measures the percentage of correctly classified samples. In the related study, the best model for the classification of Mengshan green tea achieved an accuracy of 100%, indicating that it correctly classified all the samples.\n\nFor the quantitative analysis task, the R2 metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables. A higher R2 value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. In the related study, the best model for the quantitative analysis of the doping of Laochuan tea tree Ganlu achieved an R2 of 0.959, indicating that 95.9% of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables.\n\nThe RMSE metric measures the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower RMSE value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. In the related study, the best model for the quantitative analysis of the doping of Laochuan tea tree Ganlu achieved an RMSE of 0.065."
