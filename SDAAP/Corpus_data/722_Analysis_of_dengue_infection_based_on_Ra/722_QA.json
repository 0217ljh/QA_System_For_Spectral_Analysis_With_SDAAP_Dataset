        "Output": "In the related study, SVM models were used to classify dengue suspected human blood sera based on features obtained from Raman spectra. Three different kernel functions, namely Gaussian radial basis function (RBF), polynomial function, and linear function, were employed to build the SVM models. The SVM models were trained using the Raman spectra data from 84 clinically dengue suspected patients. The spectral differences between dengue positive and normal sera were exploited by the SVM models to classify the blood sera. The performance of the SVM models was evaluated using the 10-fold cross validation method. The best performance was achieved with the polynomial kernel of order 1, which resulted in a diagnostic accuracy of about 85%, precision of 90%, sensitivity of 73%, and specificity of 93%."
