Nine different machine learning algorithms, including linear methods, non-linear methods, and rule-based methods, were selected to represent a range of characteristics and abilities to handle different types of data. \n\nFifteen spectral parameters were initially introduced as input features to the models, and the study found that a maximum of four features were selected as the best combinations to classify lunar soils based on their types, particle size, maturity, and the type of pyroxene. The Support Vector Machine with radial basis function (svmRadial) and the penalized logistic regression model (gitnnet) performed well for all target variables with high accuracies.\n\nThe study also identified specific important features for classifying soil type, grain size, maturity, and type of pyroxene from reflectance spectra. These features included band depths and integrated band depths at specific wavelengths, band position of a specific wavelength, and four band ratios. \n\nOverall, the study demonstrated that proper preprocessing and feature engineering techniques are crucial for achieving high performance in predictive models for determining the physical"
