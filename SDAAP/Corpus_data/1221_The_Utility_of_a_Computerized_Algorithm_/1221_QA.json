        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study found that the combination of predictive models trained on neuropsychological measures, blood fatty acid profiles, and deoxygenated-hemoglobin features achieved a maximum diagnostic accuracy of 81%. The most discriminant neuropsychological features were measures of vigilance, focused and sustained attention, and cognitive flexibility. The most discriminating blood fatty acids were linoleic acid and the total amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The study also found that deoxygenated-hemoglobin data from fNIRS had a significant advantage over oxygenated-hemoglobin data in terms of predictive accuracy. These findings suggest that the machine-learning method using multidomain data can accurately identify children with ADHD and could support the clinical practice of diagnosing ADHD."

        "Output": "The researchers assessed the performance of their classifier in recognizing children with ADHD using a nested 10-fold cross validation. The original dataset was split into 10 subsets of equal size, which were used repeatedly for training and testing. Each subset was used once for performance validation."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the multi-domain profile of measures, including blood fatty acid profiles, neuropsychological measures, and functional measures from near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), can be used to accurately recognize school-aged children with ADHD. According to the study mentioned in the text, a supervised machine-learning method was developed to discriminate between children with ADHD and children with typical development using this profile of measures. The method achieved a maximum diagnostic accuracy of 81% by combining predictive models trained on neuropsychological measures, blood fatty acid profiles, and deoxygenated-hemoglobin features from fNIRS data. These findings suggest that the multi-domain profile of measures has the potential to accurately identify children with ADHD."
