        "Output": "The performance of the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) method in estimating rice leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) using passive and active spectral measurements is generally satisfactory compared to the other linear and nonlinear methods. The related study assessed the influence of six popular methods, including partial least-square regression, least squares boosting, bagging, random forest, back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector regression, on rice LNC retrieval. \n\nThe results of the study compared the R-2, root mean square error, and relative error in rice LNC estimation using these different methods. Among the methods tested, BPNN consistently provided satisfactory performance in estimating rice LNC using the three kinds of passive and active reflectance spectra. \n\nTherefore, the BPNN method is considered to be a reliable and effective approach for accurately estimating rice LNC using both passive and active spectral measurements."
