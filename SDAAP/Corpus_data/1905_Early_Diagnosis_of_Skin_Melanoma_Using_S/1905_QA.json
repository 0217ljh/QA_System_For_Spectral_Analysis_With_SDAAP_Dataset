        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the methods employed in the early diagnosis of skin melanoma was sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity measures the ability of the methods to correctly identify positive cases of melanoma, while specificity measures the ability to correctly identify negative cases. \n\nThe text states that the sensitivity and specificity of the methods employed were found to be higher than 90%. This indicates that the methods have a high accuracy in correctly identifying both positive and negative cases of skin melanoma. However, the text does not provide specific information on how far this metric can go beyond 90%."

        "Output": "The proposed complex approach for early diagnosis of skin melanoma using sequential examinations of skin lesions using several imaging systems has been found to have a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional diagnostic methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the methods employed in the approach were found to be higher than 90%. This suggests that the proposed approach is more accurate in detecting and diagnosing skin melanoma compared to traditional methods."
