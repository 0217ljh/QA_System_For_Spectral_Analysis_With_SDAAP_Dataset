        "input": "",
        "Output": "In their related study, the researchers used deep learning models, specifically support vector machine (SVM), self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine (SAE-ELM), and convolutional neural network (CNN), to process the near-infrared spectral data (4000-5600 cm(-1)) of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum samples from different origins. They trained these models using the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data and then tested their performance on a separate set of samples. The results showed that SVM achieved an average recognition accuracy of 90% on the test set, SAE-ELM achieved an average recognition accuracy of 98.3%, and CNN correctly discriminated 100% of T. hemsleyanum samples from different origins. The researchers highlighted that CNN, in particular, provided a convenient and efficient approach as it avoided redundant data preprocessing and allowed for the saved trained model to be used for rapid detection in subsequent calls."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers determined the effectiveness of the deep learning-based method for discriminating the geographical origins of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum by comparing it to traditional biochemical approaches. They used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and deep learning models, specifically support vector machine (SVM), self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine (SAE-ELM), and convolutional neural network (CNN), to process the near-infrared spectral data. The results showed that the average recognition accuracy of SVM on the test set samples was 90%, the average recognition accuracy of SAE-ELM was 98.3%, and CNN correctly discriminated 100% of T. hemsleyanum from different origins. This comparison demonstrates that the deep learning-based method outperformed the conventional biochemical approaches in accurately discriminating the geographical origins of T. hemsleyanum."
