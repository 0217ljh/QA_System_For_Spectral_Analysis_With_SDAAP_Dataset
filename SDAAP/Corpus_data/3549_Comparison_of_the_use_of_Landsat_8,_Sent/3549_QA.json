        "input": "",
        "Output": "The related study evaluated the effect of spatial resolution on soil pH mapping using satellite images in the black soil region of northeastern China by comparing the performance of different satellite images. Specifically, a high spatial resolution Gaofen (GF)-2 high-definition image and multispectral images acquired by the Landsat 8 operational land imager and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument were used. The spectral variables, including the original bands of the three satellite images and various spectral indices derived from the original bands, were employed. A machine learning model (quantile regression forest) was then used to determine the relationships between the spectral variables and the measured soil pH. Prediction models were established to estimate the soil pH and characterize its spatial pattern. The accuracy of the prediction models based on each satellite image was compared, and it was found that the soil pH prediction model based on the GF-2 image had slightly higher prediction accuracy compared to the models constructed using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images."
