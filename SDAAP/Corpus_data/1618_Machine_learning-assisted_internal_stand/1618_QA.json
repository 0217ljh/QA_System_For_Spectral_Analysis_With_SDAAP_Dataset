        "Output": "In the non-invasive and label-free detection of colon cancer using serum surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) combined with machine learning, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and principal component and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) algorithms were utilized.\n\nThese algorithms were used to establish a diagnosis model for classifying SERS spectra data. The serum SERS spectra of 50 colon cancer patients and 50 healthy volunteers were obtained using silver nanoparticle (Ag NP) colloid and mercaptopropionic acid-modified Ag NPs (Ag NPs-MPA) as the SERS substrates.\n\nThe decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and principal component and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) algorithms were applied to analyze the SERS spectra data and classify them into cancer and normal groups. The results showed that the random forest (RF) model provided a high diagnostic accuracy compared to PCA-LDA.\n\nFurthermore, the SERS spectra data were calibrated with internal standard (IS) molecules. After calibration, the decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and PCA-LDA algorithms achieved high diagnostic accuracy of over 90% and 100% specificity in differentiating between the cancer and normal groups.\n\nOverall, the combination"
