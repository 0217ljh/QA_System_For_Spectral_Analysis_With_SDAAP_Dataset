The results showed that using the convolutional autoencoder (CAE), the accuracy for classifying two levels of driver cognitive load was 73.25% and for classifying four levels of driver cognitive load was 47.21% with a 30-second window. On the other hand, the proposed Echo State Network (ESN) autoencoder achieved higher accuracy, with 80.61% for classifying two levels of driver cognitive load and 52.45% for classifying four levels of driver cognitive load."

        "Output": "In the development of the machine learning framework for classifying driver cognitive load using fNIRS, both the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and Echo State Network (ESN) autoencoder were used to extract features from fNIRS data.\n\nThe CAE was applied to classify different levels of driver cognitive load. It was used to analyze the fNIRS data and extract relevant features. The accuracy achieved using the CAE for classifying two levels of driver cognitive load with a 30-second window was 73.25%, while for classifying four levels, the accuracy was 47.21%.\n\nOn the other hand, the ESN autoencoder was also employed for feature extraction from fNIRS data. It achieved state-of-the-art classification results for group-level models without window selection. The accuracy obtained using the ESN autoencoder for classifying two levels of driver cognitive load was 80.61%, and for classifying four levels, the accuracy was 52.45%.\n\nOverall, both the CAE and ESN autoencoder were utilized to extract features from fNIRS data and classify different levels of driver cognitive load. The results suggest that the proposed ESN autoencoder is particularly effective in extracting temporal information from fNIRS data and can be beneficial for"
