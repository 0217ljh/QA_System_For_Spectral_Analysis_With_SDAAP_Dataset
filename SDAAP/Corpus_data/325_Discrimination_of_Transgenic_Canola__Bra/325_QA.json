        "Output": "The metric used to detect and monitor the presence of genetically modified (GM) crops and crop products was classification accuracy.A combination of different preprocessing methods (four methods) and various modeling approaches (eight methods) was used for effective discrimination. Among these combinations, the Savitzky-Golay and Support Vector Machine combination was found to be the optimal model with the highest accuracy rate of 100%. Additionally, the use of a Convolutional Neural Network with Normalization resulted in an accuracy rate of 98.9%."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The handheld Vis-NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometric analyses method is described as reliable, quick, and low-cost for detecting and monitoring the presence of genetically modified (GM) crops and crop products in the Brassicaceae family. The past study found that this method was able to effectively discriminate between GM and non-GM Brassica napus, B. rapa, and F1 hybrids with a high accuracy rate of 100% when using a combination of Savitzky-Golay preprocessing and Support Vector Machine modeling. Additionally, the use of a Convolutional Neural Network with Normalization resulted in an accuracy rate of 98.9%. The past study also showed that the handheld Vis-NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometric analyses method could be combined with biochemical composition analysis for even more efficient discrimination. Overall, this method offers a reliable, quick, and low-cost approach for detecting and monitoring the presence of GM crops and crop products in the Brassicaceae family."
