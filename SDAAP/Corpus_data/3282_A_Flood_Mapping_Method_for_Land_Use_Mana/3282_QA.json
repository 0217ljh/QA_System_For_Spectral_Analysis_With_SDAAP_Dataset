        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning method based on unsupervised classification, known as EM cluster, contributed to the flood mapping methodology by providing a means to classify and identify flood-affected areas in small-sized water bodies. This method uses statistical algorithms to group pixels with similar spectral characteristics into clusters, without the need for prior training or labeled data. By applying the EM cluster classification, the flood mapping methodology was able to identify and delineate water-covered areas in the satellite images, even when the water surfaces were similar in size to the spatial resolution of the imagery. The combination of the EM cluster classification with other techniques, such as the AWE spectral indices and various thresholding methods, resulted in improved accuracy and effectiveness in mapping floods in small-sized water bodies using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combined methodology using AWE spectral indices and various methods contributed to flood mapping in small-sized water bodies using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery by improving the accuracy and effectiveness of the mapping process. By utilizing a super-resolution algorithm, the image resolution was enhanced, allowing for better detection and mapping of water surfaces in small-sized water bodies. The set of seven spectral indices, including AWE indices, helped to highlight water-covered areas, aiding in the identification of flooded regions. \n\nAdditionally, the methodology employed two flood mapping methods: a machine learning method based on unsupervised classification (EM cluster) and 14 thresholding methods for automatic determination. These methods, when combined with the AWE spectral indices, provided more accurate and reliable flood mapping results. \n\nThe evaluation of the methodology in the Carrion River, Palencia, Spain, demonstrated that the approach combining AWE spectral indices with methods such as Huang and Wang, Li and Tam, Otsu, moment preservation, and EM cluster classification yielded the best results in flood mapping. The quantitative accuracy index showed global accuracy and Kappa coefficient values higher than 0.88 and 0.75, respectively, indicating the effectiveness of the combined methodology in accurately mapping floods in small-sized water bodies using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery."
