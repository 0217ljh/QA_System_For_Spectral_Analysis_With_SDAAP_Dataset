The recognition rates of the calibration set and prediction set were 100.00% and 95.00%, respectively. \n\nThis indicates that the model was highly effective in accurately identifying whether a sample was chilled or frozen-thawed salmon."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the CARS-ELM model combined with the MSC preprocessing spectrum can be considered a superior method compared to traditional methods for detecting the quality of salmon and differentiating between chilled and frozen-thawed salmon. The results of the study showed that this model had the best recognition effect on chilled and frozen-thawed salmon, with recognition rates of 100.00% for the calibration set and 95.00% for the prediction set. This indicates that the model is highly accurate in identifying the quality of salmon. Additionally, the CARS-ELM model based on the preprocessing spectrum of MSC also had the best effect on identifying the times of frozen and thawed salmon, with recognition rates of 97.50% for the calibration set and 91.67% for the prediction set. This suggests that the model is effective in differentiating between salmon with different frozen-thawed times. Overall, the CARS-ELM model combined with the MSC preprocessing spectrum offers a fast and non-destructive method for detecting the quality of salmon and can be considered superior to traditional methods."
