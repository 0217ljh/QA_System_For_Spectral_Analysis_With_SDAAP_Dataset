The approach is based on neural networks trained using collocated satellite data and accurate ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) aerosol data. By predicting the approximation error in the conventional retrieval, the approach can correct the existing operational satellite aerosol data products without requiring reprocessing. This approach has been demonstrated to produce high-resolution aerosol data with better accuracy than the operational Sentinel-3 Level-2 Synergy aerosol product and slightly better accuracy than the conventional fully learned machine learning approach. It also shows better generalization capabilities compared to the fully learned approach. Therefore, this post-process correction approach has the potential to be applied to other satellite aerosol data products to improve their accuracy and spatial resolution."
