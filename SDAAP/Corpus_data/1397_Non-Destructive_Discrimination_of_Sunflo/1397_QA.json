        "Output": "Yes, the proposed non-destructive and rapid method based on fusion spectra can effectively classify the mildew grade of sunflower seeds. The method combines near-infrared diffuse reflectance and near-infrared diffuse transmission spectra, providing more comprehensive information for better discrimination accuracy. The method utilizes a one-dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model, which outperformed other conventional machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The CNN model achieved a high prediction accuracy of 97.60% for the training set and 94.04% for the test set. Therefore, this method can be applied in the quality control of sunflower seeds to mitigate the risk to human health posed by contaminated seeds."
