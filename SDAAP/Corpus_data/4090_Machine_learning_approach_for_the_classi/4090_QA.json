        "Output": "No. Based on the given related study, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the high classification accuracy achieved by the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier using digital images of corn seeds can be attributed to the use of spectral feature processing methods. The related study states that the hybrid feature dataset used for classification includes histogram, texture, and spectral features. However, it does not provide any specific information on the contribution of spectral features to the classification accuracy. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine if the high accuracy can be solely attributed to the use of spectral feature processing methods."
