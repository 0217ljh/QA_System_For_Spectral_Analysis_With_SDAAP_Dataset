        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the related research, the impact of five different atmospheric correction methods on land cover classification accuracy using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was examined. The atmospheric correction methods evaluated were surface reflectance (SREF), standardized surface reflectance (STDSREF), Sentinel-2 atmospheric correction (S2AC), image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR), dark object subtraction (DOS), and top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance without any atmospheric correction.\n\nThe study utilized four different machine learning classification techniques: extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and catboost (CB). The classification was performed on five different land cover classes: bare land, low vegetation, high vegetation, water, and built-up area.\n\nThe results showed that SVM classification consistently provided the best overall accuracy for all twelve dates and for all atmospheric correction methods. This was true for both cases: when using Sentinel-2 bands and radiometric indices, as well as when using only spectral bands.\n\nWhen considering the atmospheric correction methods, the best correction for classification with SVM using radiometric indices was found to be S2AC, with a median accuracy value of 96.54%."
