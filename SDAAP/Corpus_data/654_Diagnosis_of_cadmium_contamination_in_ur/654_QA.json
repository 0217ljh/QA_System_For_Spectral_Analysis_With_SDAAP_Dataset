        "Output": "Based on the information provided in the related work, it is not explicitly stated whether the framework developed in the related work can be applied to diagnose soil cadmium contamination in other areas with different soil characteristics and contamination levels. The related study specifically focuses on soil samples collected from urban and suburban areas located in Wuhan City, China. Therefore, it is unclear whether the framework would be applicable to other areas with different soil characteristics and contamination levels. Further research and validation would be necessary to determine the generalizability of the framework to different areas."
