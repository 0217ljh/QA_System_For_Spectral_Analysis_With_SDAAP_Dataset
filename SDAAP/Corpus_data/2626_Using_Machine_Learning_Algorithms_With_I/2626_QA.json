The study aimed to test how well the random forest (RF) and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) algorithms could retrieve the WQI using hyperspectral data. The study found that both algorithms performed well in WQI estimations, with the 1D-CNN model performing significantly better than the RF model, especially on high WQI samples. The study also identified essential wavelengths (mainly located between 580-590 nm and near 722, 751, 821, and 830 nm) that were used as input data to achieve better retrieval results. Therefore, the chosen metric of WQI, along with the RF and 1D-CNN algorithms, was able to effectively assess and retrieve comprehensive water quality characteristics from the hyperspectral data."

This means that the noise of the original hyperspectral reflectance data had a limited impact on the algorithms."

        "Output": "The study compared the performance of the random forest (RF) and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) algorithms in retrieving the water quality index (WQI) using hyperspectral data from urban rivers. The results showed that both algorithms performed well in WQI estimations. However, the 1D-CNN model performed significantly better than the RF model, especially on high WQI samples. Additionally, the study found that both models were insensitive to smoothing of the hyperspectral data, indicating that the noise of the original hyperspectral reflectance data had limited impact on the algorithms. Furthermore, when the essential wavelength data (mainly located between 580-590 nm and near 722, 751, 821, and 830 nm) were used as input data, better retrieval results were achieved. The 1D-CNN model performed the best with an R-2 of 0.87, RMSE of 0.574, and RPIQ of 3.082 when the top tenth percentile of the essential wavelength data was used. Overall, the study demonstrated the potential of the 1D-CNN algorithm for hyperspectral data analysis in retrieving comprehensive water quality."
