        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the satellite aerosol data products in this study is the number of AOD samples within the MODIS Dark Target expected error envelope. The study found that when the post-process correction was applied, the number of AOD samples within the error envelope increased from 63% to 85%. This indicates that the post-process correction approach significantly improves the accuracy of the satellite aerosol data products."

        "Output": "The model-enforced post-process correction approach utilizes auxiliary data sources to enhance the quality of existing operational satellite aerosol data products by incorporating additional information into the correction model. This includes utilizing meteorological information and additional observations, such as spectral bands that were unused by the original retrieval algorithm. By incorporating these auxiliary data sources, the correction model can learn to correct for biases and uncertainties in the original retrieval algorithms, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced associated uncertainties in the satellite aerosol data products."
