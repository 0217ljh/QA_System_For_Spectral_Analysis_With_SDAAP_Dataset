        "input": "",
        "Output": "The researchers investigated the feasibility of using image colour information to predict the moisture content of dried Hami jujube by obtaining images under different colour space models. They then extracted the colour model component mean and chromaticity frequency sequences of various colour spaces such as R, G, B, H, S, V, L*, a*, and b* through image analysis. After optimizing these colour model components and chromaticity frequency sequences, they established and compared different models. The best prediction effect was achieved by the GA-ELM (genetic algorithm-extreme learning machine) model, which was established using the CARS (competitive adaptive reweighted sampling) method to optimize 12 chromaticity features of the S chromaticity frequency sequence. The model had an R-c value of 0.917, R-F value of 0.934, and residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 2.507. Therefore, the researchers concluded that colour image information can accurately predict the moisture content of dried Hami jujube."
