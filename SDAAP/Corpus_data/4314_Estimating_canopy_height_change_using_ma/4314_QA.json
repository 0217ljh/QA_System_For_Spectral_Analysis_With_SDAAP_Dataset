        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the accuracy of CHM (canopy height model) estimation was the correlation coefficient (R) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the estimated CHM and the reference CHM derived from ALS data. The RMSE quantifies the average difference between the estimated CHM and the reference CHM, providing a measure of the overall accuracy of the estimation.\n\nThe related study states that the correlation coefficient (R) for the estimation of CHM using the Gradient Boosting Regression method was 0.64."

        "Output": "Yes, the integration of stereo-based CHM with vegetation indices from Landsat 7 using machine learning methods can be considered a superior approach compared to traditional methods for estimating CHM and CHC. The results of the study showed that this integration improved the estimation of 4-year CHC by explaining more than 70% of CHM variability. Additionally, among the six widely used machine learning methods tested, the Gradient Boosting Regression method provided the most reliable estimates of CHM, indicating the effectiveness of this approach. Therefore, the combination of remote-sensing structural and spectral information through machine learning methods offers a more accurate and reliable estimation of CHM and CHC compared to traditional methods."
