        "input": "",
        "Output": "Spectroscopic methods, specifically UV-absorbance in the range of 250-400 nm, can be considered superior to traditional methods for comparing the water soluble extractive (WSE) values of wild and cultivated Astragali radix (AR) in the past study. The past study states that the UV-absorbance of the WSE of wild and cultivated AR was different, indicating that this spectroscopic method can effectively differentiate between the two types of AR."
