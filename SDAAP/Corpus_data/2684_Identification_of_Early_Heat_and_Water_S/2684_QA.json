        "Output": "The metric chosen to detect early heat and water stress in strawberry plants was accuracy. The accuracy of the indicators was measured using machine-learning models. The accuracy assessment determined how well the indicators could detect early heat and water stress in strawberry plants. The related study states that the random-forest classifier, when using all eight indices, achieved an accuracy of 94%. Additionally, the gradient-boosting classifier, when using a combination of four specific indices, achieved an accuracy of 91%. Therefore, the metric of accuracy was used to evaluate the performance of the indicators in detecting heat and water stress in strawberry plants."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the investigation, machine-learning models were utilized to assess the performance of the chlorophyll-fluorescence indices in detecting early heat and water stress in strawberry plants. The hyperspectral images captured the fluorescence reflectance in the range of 500 nm-900 nm. From these images, the region of interest (leaves) was identified, and eight chlorophyll-fluorescence indices were extracted from this region.\n\nThese eight indices were then deeply analyzed to identify the best indicators for detecting heat and water stress in strawberry plants. The machine-learning models, specifically the random-forest classifier and the gradient-boosting classifier, were developed using these indices. \n\nThe accuracy of the indicators was assessed using the machine-learning models. The proposed workflow suggests that by including all eight indices, the random-forest classifier performs well, with an accuracy of 94%. Additionally, the combination of the red-edge vegetation stress index (RVSI), chlorophyll B (Chl-b), pigment-specific simple ratio for chlorophyll B (PSSRb), and the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIREDEDGE) resulted in a gradient-boosting classifier with an accuracy of 91%."

The study found that by using these indices, machine-learning models such as the random-forest classifier and gradient-boosting classifier were able to accurately assess the performance of the indicators. The random-forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 94%, while the gradient-boosting classifier achieved an accuracy of 91%. This suggests that the combination of these indices can effectively detect early heat and water stress in strawberry plants. Additionally, the proposed workflow is advantageous as it can work well with a limited number of training samples."
