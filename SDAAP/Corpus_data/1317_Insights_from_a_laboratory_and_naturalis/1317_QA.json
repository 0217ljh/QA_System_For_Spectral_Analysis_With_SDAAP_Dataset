        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, spectroscopic methods can be used to assess cortical blood oxygenation during the stress paradigms in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. In the study mentioned in the text, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure cortical blood oxygenation during the stress paradigms. This method allows researchers to non-invasively measure changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels in the brain, providing information about brain activity and oxygenation."
