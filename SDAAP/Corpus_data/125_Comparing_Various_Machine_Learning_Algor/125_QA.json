        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the prediction models in this study is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). RMSE measures the average magnitude of the residuals or prediction errors, indicating how close the predicted values are to the actual values. \n\nRMSE alone can provide a good assessment of accuracy as it gives an overall measure of the model's performance. However, it is important to consider other metrics as well to have a comprehensive evaluation. In this study, other metrics such as Residual Standard Error (RSE), Coefficient of Determination (R2), and Adjusted Coefficient of Determination (adjusted R2) were also used to assess the models' performance. These additional metrics provide further insights into the model's ability to explain the variance in the data and adjust for the number of predictors in the model."
