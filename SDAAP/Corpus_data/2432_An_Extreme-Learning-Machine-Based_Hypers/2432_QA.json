        "Output": "In the study proposing a non-contact detection method of insulator pollution degree based on hyperspectral technique, the extreme learning machine (ELM) was used to classify the pollution degree of test samples. A multiclassification model of ELM was built using the hyperspectral curves obtained from the region of interest (ROI) of corrected images. The ELM model was trained using the hyperspectral data from samples with different pollution degrees, and it was able to accurately and rapidly classify the pollution degree of test samples. The classification accuracy of the ELM model for NaCl, CaSO4, and mixed NaCl-CaSO4 pollution degrees reached 95%, 97.5%, and 97.5% respectively."

        "Output": "Yes, the hyperspectral technique can be considered as a superior alternative to traditional methods for the non-contact detection of insulator pollution degree in the related study. The results of the study show that the hyperspectral technique, when combined with a multiclassification model of extreme learning machine (ELM), can accurately and rapidly classify the pollution degree of insulator umbrellas with different types of pollution. The classification accuracy achieved by the ELM model based on hyperspectral curves data is high, reaching 95% for NaCl, 97.5% for CaSO4, and 97.5% for mixed NaCl-CaSO4. This demonstrates the considerable potential of hyperspectral technique for non-contact detection of insulator pollution degree."
