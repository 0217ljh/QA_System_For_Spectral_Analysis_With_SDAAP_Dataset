        "Output": "The deep-learning-based OBIC framework introduced in the related paper achieves a high overall accuracy of 97% when classifying an UAV image into five categories. This indicates that the framework is highly accurate in land-use/land-cover applications. \n\nFurthermore, the experiment conducted in the paper shows that the deep-learning-based framework outperforms traditional methods such as linear support vector machine (linear SVM) and radial basis function kernel support vector machine (RBF SVM) algorithms when there is a lack of sufficient training samples. The framework increases the overall accuracy by approximately 6% compared to these traditional methods. \n\nTherefore, the deep-learning-based OBIC framework not only achieves high accuracy but also performs better than traditional methods in scenarios where training samples are limited."
