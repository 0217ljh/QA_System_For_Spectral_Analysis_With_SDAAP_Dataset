        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning (ML) models in the research was the coefficient of determination (R2). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variability in the predicted values that can be explained by the ML model. In this study, the trained support vector regression model (SVR) achieved an R2 value of 0.88, outperforming the conventional source tracking method of end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) which had an R2 value of 0.83. \n\nThe R2 value can range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit of the model to the data. In this case, an R2 value of 0.88 suggests that the SVR model can explain 88% of the variability in the proportions of different dissolved organic matter (DOM) sources in the mixture samples. \n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of R2 provides a quantitative measure of the ML model's performance in accurately predicting the proportions of different DOM sources. It indicates how well the model captures the relationship between the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) data and the mixing ratios of the bulk samples."

        "Output": "Yes, the ML models based on fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy can outperform traditional methods in quantifying the proportions of different dissolved organic matter (DOM) sources in mixture samples under natural transformation conditions. The study mentioned in the text found that ML models based on all the EEM data performed better than those based on defined fluorescence indices. Specifically, the trained support vector regression model (SVR) outperformed the conventional source tracking method of end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) with a higher R2 value. The SVR model explained a significant amount of the variability in the proportions of soil and compost sources in the DOM mixture, with low mean squared errors. This suggests that ML techniques with EEM data have the potential to accurately trace the source of DOM and can be used to develop models capable of tracking multiple DOM sources, even in the absence of all possible end-members."
