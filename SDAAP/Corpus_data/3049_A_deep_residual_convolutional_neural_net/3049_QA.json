        "Output": "The advantages of using the mineral-CNN-LSTM and mineral-ResNet frameworks compared to other CNN-based architectures and machine learning classifiers in the classification of minerals in hyperspectral remote sensing data are as follows:\n\n1. Improved Accuracy: The mineral-CNN-LSTM and mineral-ResNet frameworks achieved high overall accuracy rates of 91.71% and 92.16% respectively in identifying minerals such as Alunite, Calcite, Halloysite, Kaolinite, Montmorillonite, Muscovite, and Chalcedony. This indicates that these frameworks are effective in accurately classifying minerals in hyperspectral remote sensing data.\n\n2. Enhanced Performance: The proposed frameworks outperformed widely used CNN-based architectures such as VGG19, VGG16, ResNet-50, and AlexNet, as well as various machine learning classifiers. They offer better performance in terms of shorter testing and training time, indicating their efficiency in processing hyperspectral remote sensing data.\n\n3. Raw Data Input: The mineral-CNN-LSTM and mineral-ResNet frameworks use raw data as input without the need for feature selection or data augmentation preprocessing steps. This simplifies the data preparation process and reduces the risk of losing important information during feature selection.\n\n4. Deep Learning Techniques"
