        "Output": "In the study, several factors were identified that favor and limit the retrieval of soil moisture content (SMC) using the hybrid method and the data-driven method in different grassland sites. \n\nFor the hybrid method, which targeted the soil brightness factor of the PROSAIL model using a variational heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes regression (VHGPR) algorithm, the study found that the complex canopy structure of grassland was the main factor that limited the retrieval of SMC. This means that the presence of a thick thatch layer in the grassland sites, such as in Fendt and Grosses Bruch, jeopardized the application of the hybrid model.\n\nOn the other hand, the data-driven method employing VHGPR for SMC retrieval showed high accuracy in certain grassland sites. In Fendt, where the grassland was managed by mowing, the data-driven approach had high accuracy (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 8.66). In Marquardt, where the grassland was managed by irrigation, the data-driven approach also showed good accuracy (R-2 = 0.4, RMSE = 10.52)."

        "Output": "The results of the hybrid approach and the data-driven approach in different grassland sites provide valuable insights into the potential of spectroscopic methods for retrieving soil moisture content (SMC) using unmanned aerial systems (UAS).\n\nThe hybrid approach, which combines the soil brightness factor of the PROSAIL model with a variational heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes regression (VHGPR) algorithm, showed promising results in one of the grassland sites (Marquardt). It achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.5 Vol_% and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.2. This suggests that the hybrid approach has the potential to accurately retrieve SMC in certain grassland areas. However, it was found that the complex canopy structure of grassland, particularly the presence of a thatch layer, posed challenges for the application of the hybrid model in the other grassland sites (Fendt, Grosses Bruch).\n\nOn the other hand, the data-driven approach, which employed VHGPR for the retrieval of SMC based on UAS-borne VIS-NIR hyperspectral data, showed high accuracy in two of the grassland sites (Fendt, Marquardt)."
