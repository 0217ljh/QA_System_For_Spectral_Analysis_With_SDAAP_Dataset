        "Output": "Yes, the machine learning methods implemented in the related study using rotational absorption spectra in the THz region can be applied to other frequency ranges, compounds, and conditions for gas sensing applications. The study suggests that the THz spectra in the frequency range of 220-330 GHz provide a sufficient spectral fingerprint for the machine learning classifiers to learn and predict speciation. Therefore, it is possible to extrapolate these methods to different frequency ranges and compounds, as well as different conditions, for automated gas sensing."
