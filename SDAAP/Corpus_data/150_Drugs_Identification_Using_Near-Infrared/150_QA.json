        "input": "",
        "Output": "The spectral feature processing methods used to analyze the drug attribute identification and classify drugs quickly and accurately are Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost. RF is used to screen the effective characteristic wavelength of the spectrometer's spectral data and eliminate irrelevant wavelengths in the drug spectral data. This helps to identify the characteristic wavelengths that can best characterize the sample properties. CatBoost, which is an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) weak classifier, is then used to analyze the feature wavelengths identified by RF for drug attribute identification. By integrating CatBoost as a weak classifier, the model's identification accuracy is improved."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the RF-CATBoost identification model proposed using spectral analysis technology can be considered superior to traditional methods in achieving pollution-free drugs. The model has higher classification accuracy, faster speed, and stronger robustness compared to other methods such as Back Propagation with CatBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), BP, ELM, Summation Wavelet Extreme Learning Machine (SWELM), and Boosting. The experimental results show that with the increase of training sets, the highest classification accuracy reaches 100% and the prediction standard deviation tends to be 0. This indicates that the RF-CATBoost model can accurately and quickly classify and identify drugs, making it suitable for achieving effective supervision of drug quality."
