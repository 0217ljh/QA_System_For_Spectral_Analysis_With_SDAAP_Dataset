        "Output": "The decision tree-based nonparametric classifiers (Random Forest and regression tree modelling) were compared with the parametric sub-pixel classification approach in mapping savannah woody cover using Earth observation data by evaluating their performance in extracting the required ecosystem attribute from imagery. The study used detailed field quantification of % woody cover in 1 ha plots for the training stage of the decision tree-based classifiers. The SPOT 6 NAOMI imagery, which excluded grass from the spectral signature of non-senescent vegetation, was used. The resolution of the multispectral bands was enhanced to 1.5 m using high pass filter pan-sharpening to improve the capability to extract woody cover. Multiresolution image segmentation was employed as a preliminary step in extracting the woody cover for the decision tree-based classifiers. The classifiers were trained using a portion of the field sampling sites and the remaining sites were used for accuracy assessment. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated based on their overall accuracy in mapping the discontinuous savannah woody cover. The results showed that Random Forest produced the highest overall accuracy (95.7%), followed by regression tree modelling (90.6%), and sub-pixel classification (73.3%)."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, based on the results mentioned in the related study, the Random Forest classifier and regression tree modelling methods using Earth observation data can be considered superior to traditional classification approaches in mapping savannah woody cover. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy of 95.7%, followed by regression tree modelling with an accuracy of 90.6%. In comparison, the sub-pixel classification method had a lower accuracy of 73.3%. The nonparametric classifiers (Random Forest and regression tree modelling) were able to accurately model the landscape distribution, including the discontinuous formations and occasional continuous formations of woody cover in the savannah. Therefore, these methods are more appropriate for mapping the discontinuous savannah woody cover compared to traditional classification approaches."
