        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the reliability of the model is the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and residual prediction deviation (RPD). These metrics are commonly used in regression analysis to evaluate the performance of a model.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the provided results indicate that the selected wavelengths achieved high levels of accuracy for the prediction of heavy metals. The R-2 values for chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) were 0.96, 0.91, and 0.90 respectively, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values. The RMSE values were also relatively low, indicating small errors in the predictions. The RPD values, which assess the ratio of the standard deviation of the reference values to the RMSE, were 5.0 for Cr, 3.4 for Pb, and 3.3 for Hg. These values suggest that the model's predictions are reliable and accurate for screening heavy metals in organic fertilizers."

        "Output": "The use of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VisNIR), Boruta algorithm, and deep learning in establishing rapid screening methods for heavy metals in organic fertilizers has shown to be more reliable and accurate compared to traditional methods. \n\nThe VisNIR technique, coupled with Boruta and deep learning, allows for quick identification of heavy metals in organic fertilizers. This approach extracts appropriate wavelengths using the Boruta algorithm and computes a deep belief network (DBN) to determine the amounts of various heavy metals such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg). \n\nThe results obtained from the selected wavelengths using this approach were excellent, with high values for coefficient of determination (R-2), indicating a strong correlation between predicted and actual values. The root mean squared error (RMSE) and residual prediction deviation (RPD) were also used to calculate the reliability of the model, and the values obtained were favorable.\n\nComparing this approach with traditional methods such as support vector machine for regression (SVR), k nearest neighbor (KNN), and partial least squares (PLS), the VisNIR technique coupled with Boruta and DBN showed superior performance. The overall results indicated that this approach could provide reliable and accurate"
