        "input": "",
        "Output": "The combination of fluorescence hyperspectral technology and the proposed 1D CNN-RF model outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and non-destructiveness for identifying pesticide residues on black tea. The study found that the accuracy of the test set using the 1D CNN-RF model was 99.05%, which suggests a high level of accuracy in identifying pesticide residues. Additionally, the use of fluorescence hyperspectral technology allows for non-destructive identification, meaning that the tea samples do not need to be physically altered or damaged during the testing process. This combination of advanced technology and machine learning models offers a more efficient and reliable approach to identifying pesticide residues on black tea compared to traditional methods."
