        "Output": "The results of comparing the three machine learning algorithms (classification and regression tree, random forest, and support vector machine) in the classification of tree mortality caused by the red turpentine beetle (RTB) at both single-tree and forest stand scales using different satellite imagery are as follows:\n\n- At the single-tree scale, the highest classification accuracy was achieved using the pixel-based method and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with 1 m resolution Gaofen-2 (GF2) imagery (overall accuracy = 77.7%).\n\n- At the forest stand scale, the classification of three degrees of damage percentage within the Sentinel-2 (S2) pixel (0%, <15%, and 15% < x < 50%) was not successful. However, effective binary classification (<15% and 15% < x < 50%) was achieved using 10 m resolution S2 images (overall accuracy for <15%: 74.9%; overall accuracy for 15% < x < 50%: 81.0%).\n\nTherefore, the SVM algorithm with 1 m resolution GF2 imagery was the most accurate in classifying tree mortality at the single-tree scale, while 10 m resolution S2 images were effective in classifying tree mortality"
