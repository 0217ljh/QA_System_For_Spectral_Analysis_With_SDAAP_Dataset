        "Output": "The results of comparing the deep neural network (DNN) models with the support vector machine (SVM) and mixture-tuned matched filtering (MTMF) methods in terms of mineral identification and mapping in SASI hyperspectral images showed that the mapping results of the 1D and 2D CNN model were more accurate than those of the other methods. The test accuracies of the FCNN, 1D CNN, and 1D and 2D CNN were 91.24%, 93.67%, and 94.77%, respectively. The introduction of spatial information in the 1D and 2D CNN model improved the mineral identification ability, especially for minerals with similar spectral characteristics. This indicates that CNNs have good application prospects in geological mapping of hyperspectral remote sensing images."

        "Output": "Yes, based on the information provided in the related study, the 1D and 2D CNN models showed more accurate mapping results compared to the traditional methods of SVM and MTMF for mineral identification in hyperspectral remote sensing images. The related study states that the 1D and 2D CNN model had a more accurate discrimination effect, especially for minerals with similar spectral characteristics. This indicates that the introduction of spatial information through the CNN models improved the mineral identification ability in hyperspectral remote sensing images. Therefore, the 1D and 2D CNN models can be considered superior to traditional methods for mineral identification in this context."
