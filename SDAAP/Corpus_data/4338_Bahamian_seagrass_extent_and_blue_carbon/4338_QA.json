        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the scalable Earth Observation framework developed and applied in the related study can be used to assess the national extent, blue carbon stock, and sequestration rate of seagrass ecosystems in other countries as well. The framework utilizes modern Earth Observation advances and the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, making it a scalable technological solution. By adapting the framework to incorporate nation-specific in-situ observations, it can support spatially-explicit seagrass and ocean ecosystem accounting in other countries, enabling effective policy-making, blue carbon crediting, and relevant financial investments."
