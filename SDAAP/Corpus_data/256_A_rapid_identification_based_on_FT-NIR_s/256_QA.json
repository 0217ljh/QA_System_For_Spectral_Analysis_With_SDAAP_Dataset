These models were trained using the data obtained from Fourier-transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) analysis of A. tsao-ko samples dried at different temperatures. The models were then used to build discriminant models to classify and identify the drying temperature of A. tsao-ko samples. The accuracy of the GS-SVM, GA-SVM, and ResNet models was reported to be more than 99% in the test set, indicating their effectiveness in identifying the drying temperature of A. tsao-ko. Additionally, the ResNet model based on synchronous two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) images achieved the most satisfactory discrimination results."
