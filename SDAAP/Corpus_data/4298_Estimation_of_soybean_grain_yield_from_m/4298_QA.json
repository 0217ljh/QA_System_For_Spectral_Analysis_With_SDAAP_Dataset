        "Output": "The spectral feature processing methods used for soybean yield estimation included the computation of twenty Vegetative Indices (VIs) using the \"spectralIndices\" function from the RStoolbox package within R software. Additionally, pixel values of spectral bands, canopy height, and textural features were extracted from plot polygons generated using on-the-screen digitizing from UAV-RGB imagery."

        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in predicting soybean yield was the coefficient of determination (R2). The study found that all five ML models performed moderately well in predicting grain yield for the soybean trials investigated, with the Cubist and Random Forest (RF) models standing out. These models achieved an R2 value of 0.89, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual soybean yields."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The machine learning regression models (Cubist, XGBoost, GBM, SVM, and RF) were integrated with the UAV-based spectral bands, canopy height, vegetation indices (VI), and texture features to predict crop grain yield. The spectral bands, canopy height, VI, and texture features were generated using a Sequoia (R) camera aboard a senseFly eBee X UAV during the 2020 growing season in Nigeria. These features were then used as input variables for the ML models. The ML models were trained using the input variables and the corresponding crop grain yield data from five variety trials. The models were designed to learn the relationship between the input variables and the crop grain yield, allowing them to make predictions on the yield for new data. The performance of the ML models in predicting grain yield was evaluated, with the Cubist and RF models standing out with an R2 value of 0.89."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes, the use of machine learning models and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the study can be considered as a superior approach compared to traditional methods for rapid high throughput phenotypic workflow in soybean yield estimation. The study found that the ML models, including Cubist, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM), Support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), performed moderately well in predicting grain yield for all the soybean trials investigated, with the Cubist and RF models standing out with an R2 value of 0.89. Additionally, the integration of UAV-based spectral bands, canopy height, vegetation indices (VI), and texture features generated by gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) provided a promising alternative to the conventional use of VI in crop yield estimation. This approach allows for more efficient and consistent assessment of crop breeding trials at high spatial scales, which is not commonly applied in African crop breeding programs. Therefore, the use of machine learning models and UAVs can enhance the rapid high throughput phenotypic workflow in soybean yield estimation compared to traditional methods."
