        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the models for remote sensing inversion of POC concentration is the coefficient of determination (R2). The R2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the POC concentration that can be explained by the model. In the related study, the CNN-LSTM model achieved an R2 value of 0.88, indicating that 88% of the variance in POC concentration can be explained by the model.\n\nAs for how far this metric can go, it is important to note that the R2 value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. In the related study, the obtained R2 value of 0.88 suggests a relatively high level of accuracy in predicting POC concentration using the CNN-LSTM model. "

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The CNN-LSTM model outperforms other models, such as the Backpropagation Neural Network (BP), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in terms of prediction precision for estimating particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration in Class II water using satellite remote sensing. The CNN-LSTM model achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.88, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.66, and a residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 3.03. These values are 6.02%, 22.13%, and 28.4% better than the CNN model, respectively. This indicates that the CNN-LSTM model effectively combines spatial and temporal information, captures time-series features quickly, and strengthens the learning ability of multi-scale features. As a result, it improves the estimation precision of remote sensing models and provides good support for carbon source monitoring and assessment in lakes."
