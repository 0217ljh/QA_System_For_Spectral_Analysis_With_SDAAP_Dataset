        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. The combination of multiplicative scatter correction and the KELM method with an inexpensive and portable NIR spectrometer can be used to accurately and efficiently determine the chemical composition of pulp wood. This combination was found to effectively eliminate spectral noise and irrelevant information, and the KELM method displayed the best prediction performance compared to other modeling approaches. Therefore, this approach can be used to improve production efficiency in the pulp and paper industry by providing real-time measurement of holocellulose and lignin contents in pulp wood."
