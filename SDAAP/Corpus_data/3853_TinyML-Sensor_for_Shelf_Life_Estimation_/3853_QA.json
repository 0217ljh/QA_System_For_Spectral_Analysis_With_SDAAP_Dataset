        "Output": "In the study, fast and cost-effective non-destructive techniques based on machine learning (ML) were applied to predict and estimate the shelf life of stored fresh date fruits under different conditions. TinyML-compatible regression models were employed to predict the stages of fruit development during the storage period. These regression models were used in conjunction with low-cost Visible-Near-Infrared (VisNIR) spectral sensors (AS7265x-multi-spectral) to capture the internal physicochemical attributes of the fresh fruit."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "Yes. Based on the information provided in the related study, spectroscopic methods, specifically the use of low-cost Visible-Near-Infrared (VisNIR) spectral sensors, were employed to capture the internal physicochemical attributes of the fresh date fruits. These spectroscopic methods were used in conjunction with regression models for shelf life estimation.\n\nThe related study does not explicitly compare spectroscopic methods to traditional methods for predicting and estimating the shelf life of stored fresh date fruits. However, it does highlight the use of non-destructive techniques based on machine learning (ML) and the employment of regression models to predict the stages of fruit development during storage.\n\nWhile traditional methods for shelf life estimation may exist, the related study suggests that the application of spectroscopic methods, specifically using low-cost VisNIR spectral sensors, in combination with ML techniques, offers a fast and cost-effective approach for predicting and estimating the shelf life of stored fresh date fruits under different conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, spectroscopic methods can be considered as a potentially superior alternative to traditional methods for predicting and estimating the shelf life of stored fresh date fruits."
