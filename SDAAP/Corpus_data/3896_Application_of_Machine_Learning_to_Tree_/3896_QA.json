This metric measures the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. Additionally, the kappa coefficient is also used as a measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance.\n\nThe overall accuracy is a commonly used metric in classification tasks as it provides a general assessment of the model's performance.

        "Output": "Yes, the integration of active and passive remote sensing data, along with the addition of vertical data, can be considered superior to traditional forest survey methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency for tree species classification in the Arxan Duraer Forestry Zone. The study used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral remote sensing imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data to identify tree species. By combining spectral, textural, and topographic features, the researchers were able to distinguish between birch, larch, and nonforest areas with a high level of accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, the study investigated the impact of adding a canopy height model (CHM) extracted from the point cloud data on the classification results. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the classification improved by 7% after adding the CHM. This suggests that incorporating vertical data can enhance the accuracy of tree species classification.\n\nAdditionally, the study utilized Google Earth Engine to extract features required for classification from Sentinel-2 multispectral and radar topographic data. By applying the random forest (RF) methodology, the researchers achieved an overall accuracy of 0.98 and a kappa coefficient of 0.97 for classifying six tree species and nonforest areas."
