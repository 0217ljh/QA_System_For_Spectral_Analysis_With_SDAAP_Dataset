        "Output": "The metric chosen to assess the accuracy of classification in the related study is the STEP (shape (S), theme (T), edge (E), and position (P)) object-based similarity matrix method. This method evaluates the similarity between the classified rainfall cloud objects and the reference precipitation satellite images from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission.\n\nThe STEP method can provide a comprehensive assessment of the thematic and geometric accuracies of the classification algorithms. It takes into account various aspects such as the shape, theme, edge, and position of the classified objects. This allows for a more detailed evaluation of the performance of the algorithms in accurately identifying and locating precipitation clouds."
