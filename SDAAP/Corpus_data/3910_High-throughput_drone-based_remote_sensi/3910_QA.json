        "input": "",
        "Output": "The metric chosen to track the variation of photosynthetic activity in conifers is the Chl/carotenoid index (CCI). This metric is able to track the variation of photosynthetic activity for 30 white spruce seedlings measured over 1 year. Additionally, a machine-learning approach using CCI derived from drone-based multispectral imagery was used to model phenology of photosynthesis for the entire pedigree population of 6000 seedlings. Therefore, this metric can be used to track photosynthetic activity at a large scale and high speed."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The study demonstrates the effectiveness of drone-based carotenoid-sensitive spectral indices in tracking phenology in conifers and monitoring photosynthetic activity by using the Chl/carotenoid index (CCI). The researchers found that CCI tracked the variation of photosynthetic activity better than other vegetation indices for 30 white spruce seedlings measured over 1 year. They also conducted physiological ground measurements, including photosynthetic pigments and maximum quantum yield of Chl fluorescence, which indicated that CCI accurately reflected the changes in photosynthetic activity. Additionally, a machine-learning approach was used to model phenology of photosynthesis for the entire pedigree population of 6000 seedlings using CCI derived from drone-based multispectral imagery. This high-throughput drone-based phenotyping approach allowed for the study of climate change impacts and environmental variation on the physiological status of thousands of field-grown conifers at an unprecedented speed and scale."
