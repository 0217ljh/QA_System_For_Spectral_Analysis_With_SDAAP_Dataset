The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (soil attributes) that can be explained by the independent variable (MIR spectra). The RMSE value represents the average difference between the predicted and actual values of the soil attributes.\n\nThe research findings indicate that the SG-ML method using the chosen metrics achieved excellent predictive performance for soil organic carbon (OC), with an R-2 value of 0.88% and an RMSE value of 0.10%. For available potassium (K), the SG-ML method achieved a good performance with an R-2 value of 0.85 and an RMSE value of 4.53 mg 100 g(-1). However, for available phosphorus (P), the SG-ML method performed relatively poorer with an R-2 value of 0.84 and an RMSE value of 3.87 mg 100 g(-1).\n\nIn comparison, the deep learning (DL) method using the same metrics achieved good performance for OC (R-2 = 0.65, and RMSE = 0.17%)."
