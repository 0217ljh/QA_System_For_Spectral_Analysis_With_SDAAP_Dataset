        "Output": "Yes, the developed ML-assisted Raman probe using spectral analysis can be considered a superior method compared to traditional detection methods for the rapid on-site detection of complex chemical mixtures in food safety investigations. This is because the ML-assisted Raman probe offers several advantages over traditional methods, including high selectivity and sensitivity, simple operation at a relatively low cost, and the ability to accurately predict complex VOC mixtures even at high dilution folds. Additionally, the probe is portable, allows for non-contact operation, and provides precise classification of foodborne pathogen VOCs. These advantages make the ML-assisted Raman probe a more efficient and accurate tool for detecting and identifying foodborne pathogens in real-time, thereby enhancing food safety investigations."
