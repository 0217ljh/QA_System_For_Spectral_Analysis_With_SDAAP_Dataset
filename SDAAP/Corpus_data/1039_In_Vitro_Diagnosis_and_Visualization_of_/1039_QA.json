        "input": "",
        "Output": "In the study, machine learning models were utilized to evaluate the levels of neuron injury and intervention performance based on Raman spectral data. A random forest model was developed using the Raman spectra of neuronal and neuroglial cells. This model achieved satisfactory accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in classifying neuron viability and evaluating the intervention performance of ferulic acid. The model identified peaks around 1002 cm-1 as key fingerprints for classification. Additionally, the spectral phenylalanine-to-tryptophan ratio was used as a biomarker to visualize neuronal injury and intervention performance with a resolution of 1 \u6e2dm. Overall, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning coupled with Raman spectroscopy in pharmacological research for classifying neuronal viability and evaluating the effects of interventions."
