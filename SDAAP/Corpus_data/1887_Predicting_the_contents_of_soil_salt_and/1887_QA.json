        "Output": "Yes, based on the findings of this study, the FOD algorithm and the optimal combination of spectral indices can be used to accurately estimate the contents of salt and major soluble ions in the topsoil at Hetao Irrigation District in Inner Mongolia, China. The study found that the correlation between the contents of soil salt and soluble ions and FOD spectra increased as the derivative order increased. The optimal FOD spectra for different ions were determined, and newly proposed three-band indices showed a better correlation with ion content. The study also compared different variable selection algorithms and found that the IRIV-ELM models outperformed MCUVE-ELM and BOSS-ELM models in estimating the contents of soil salt and soluble ions. Overall, the models reached and even exceeded the quantitative prediction level, indicating that the FOD algorithm and optimal combination of spectral indices can accurately estimate the contents of salt and major soluble ions in the topsoil at Hetao Irrigation District."
