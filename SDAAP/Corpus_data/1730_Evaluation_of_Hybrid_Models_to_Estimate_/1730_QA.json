These metrics were used to evaluate the retrieval accuracy of crop traits, specifically chlorophyll and nitrogen content, at both leaf and canopy levels. \n\nThe results showed that the hybrid approach (HYB) was able to provide reliable estimations at the canopy level, with an R-2 value of 0.79 for chlorophyll content (CCC) and 0.84 for nitrogen content (CNC). The RMSE values were 0.38 g m(-2) for CCC and 1.10 g m(-2) for CNC.\n\nThe hybrid approach combined with active learning heuristics (HAL) further improved the retrieval accuracy. The best metrics achieved with HAL were an R-2 value of 0.88 and an RMSE of 0.21 g m(-2) for CCC at the canopy level, and an R-2 value of 0.93 and an RMSE of 0.71 g m(-2) for CNC at the canopy level. \n\nAt the leaf level, the hybrid approach alone failed to provide reliable estimations.

        "Output": "Yes, the hybrid approach and its variant with sampling dimensionality reduction through active learning heuristics can be considered superior to traditional methods for the retrieval of crop traits such as chlorophyll and nitrogen content in the context of the future CHIME mission. The results of the study showed that the hybrid approach (HYB) was able to provide reliable estimations at the canopy level, with good metrics for chlorophyll content (CCC) and nitrogen content (CNC). The variant of the hybrid approach, featuring sampling dimensionality reduction through active learning heuristics (HAL), further improved retrieval accuracy at both canopy and leaf levels. The HAL approach provided even better metrics for CCC and CNC at the canopy level, and also showed promising results for chlorophyll content (LCC) and nitrogen content (LNC) at the leaf level. These findings support the feasibility of an operational retrieval of crop traits using the hybrid approach in the future CHIME mission. However, further research is needed to investigate the approach across different years, sites, and crop types to enhance its transferability to other contexts."
