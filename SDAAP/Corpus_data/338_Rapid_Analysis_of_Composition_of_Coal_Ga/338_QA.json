        "Output": "The metric chosen to evaluate the performance of the SR-TELM model in coal gangue analysis is the R-2 (R-squared) value. The R-2 value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in a regression model. \n\nThe R-2 value can range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates that the model perfectly predicts the dependent variable, and a value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable.\n\nIn the case of the SR-TELM model, the R-2 values achieved for the prediction tasks of moisture, ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon content were 0.947, 0.972, 0.967, and 0.981, respectively. These high R-2 values indicate that the SR-TELM model is able to effectively predict these properties of coal gangue.\n\nTherefore, the chosen metric of R-2 demonstrates the performance and accuracy of the SR-TELM model in coal gangue analysis, showing how well it can explain the variance in the predicted properties of coal gangue."

        "input": "",
        "Output": "The advantage of using the SR-TELM deep learning model for coal gangue analysis compared to traditional chemical analysis techniques and machine learning techniques is that it offers a low-cost, highly effective, and highly reliable method. Traditional chemical analysis techniques are slow and expensive, while machine learning techniques such as random forests (RFs), extreme learning machines (ELMs), and two-hidden-layer extreme learning machines (TELMs) heavily rely on preprocessing of the spectral data. In contrast, the SR-TELM model utilizes thermal infrared spectroscopy and deep learning, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a spatial attention mechanism and residual connections, to extract spectral features and implement content prediction with TELM as a regressor. This approach effectively overcomes the dependence on preprocessing and provides quick analysis results with high accuracy. The experimental findings demonstrate that the SR-TELM model achieves excellent performance in predicting various coal gangue composition parameters, such as moisture, ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon content, with high R-2 values and low RMSE values, all within a test time of just 0.03 seconds."
