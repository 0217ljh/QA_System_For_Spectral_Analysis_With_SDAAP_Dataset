        "Output": "The combination of PCA features of VIs (vegetation indices) with original DN (digital numbers) values contributes to the accuracy and agreement in all models for large area detection of citrus HLB using low altitude remote sensing by providing a more comprehensive and informative set of features.\n\nPCA (principal components analysis) is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of the important information. By applying PCA to the VIs, the algorithm identifies the most significant components that explain the variance in the data. These components capture the essential characteristics of the VIs and help in distinguishing between healthy and HLB-infected citrus trees.\n\nBy combining the PCA features of VIs with the original DN values, the models can utilize both spectral information and spatial information. The DN values represent the raw pixel intensities, which provide information about the reflectance properties of the citrus orchard. This combination allows the models to capture both the spectral and spatial patterns associated with HLB infection.\n\nThe inclusion of PCA features of VIs and original DN values improves the accuracy and agreement in all models because it provides a more comprehensive representation of the data. The models can leverage the combined information to better differentiate between healthy and HLB-infected samples, leading to more accurate classification results.\n\nOverall, the combination"
