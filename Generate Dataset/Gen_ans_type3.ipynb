      "2565 The study demonstrates the potential of using hyperspectral data and techniques, such as feature extraction methods like PCA and MNF, in combination with machine learning algorithms to accurately classify urban tree diversity. The results show that hyperspectral data acquired in summer can accurately discriminate about 80% of urban tree diversity, including 14 different species. The study also highlights the importance of spatial and spectral resolutions in classifying urban tree diversity, with the potential for a hyperspectral spaceborne sensor like HYPXIM to greatly improve classification through phenological differentiation. Additionally, innovative methods such as object-based information and deep learning techniques have proven to be relevant for detecting vegetation types and addressing the large dimensionality of hyperspectral images for classification or dimensional reduction.\n",
      "2349 The text does not directly address the use of multi-temporal satellite images for mangrove classification in Iran with remote sensing spectrum. The information provided focuses on the introduction of noise into LAI landscapes, model selection using hyperspectral data, the impact of spatial structures on prediction accuracy, and the use of Gaussian Markov random fields for capturing spatial dependency.\n",
      "2349 The study used a Radiative Transfer Model (PROSAIL) to simulate hyperspectral data for the detection of PC concentration in Chaohu Lake. This model was able to accurately predict the Leaf Area Index (LAI) as the response variable using simulated hyperspectral data. By applying a similar approach to other freshwater lakes, where the parameters required by the PROSAIL model are defined based on the specific characteristics of the lake, such as plant traits and surface reflectance, it is possible to improve the accuracy of water quality parameter retrieval in those lakes. Additionally, introducing random and spatially dependent noise into the plant trait LAI and hyperspectral data can help simulate variations captured by the sensor during field campaigns, enhancing the reproducibility and reliability of the spectral detection method in different freshwater lake environments.\n",
      "3451 The text does not directly address super-resolution technology in relation to improving the reliability of data support for accurate inversion of water quality parameters using remote sensing spectrum. However, it does mention the importance of high spectral resolutions in remote sensing data to reflect the spectral signature of chl-a accurately. Additionally, it discusses the use of OLCI, a new-generation water-color sensor with high spatial and spectral resolution, for studying chl-a in coastal regions. This suggests that advanced sensor technologies like OLCI can contribute to improving the reliability of data support for accurate inversion of water quality parameters using remote sensing spectrum.\n",
      "4354 The spectral data and weather conditions influenced the estimation of cover and growth patterns of exotic annuals and native perennial grass species in the study by allowing for the development of species-specific maps of grass abundance using HLS data. The study utilized a multi-task learning framework that leveraged artificial intelligence/machine learning for the simultaneous estimation of multispectral data and subsequent estimation of grass species abundance. The spectral data from HLS images were used to develop cloud/shadow free weekly spectral layers, and species-specific exotic annual and perennial grass percent cover datasets were created for historical and rapid estimation. The anomaly of annual averages of cheatgrass and EAG abundances showed moderate to high correlations with the anomaly of total hydrologic year precipitation in most ecoregions, indicating a relationship between grass abundance and precipitation levels. The study also demonstrated the effectiveness of a data fusion approach using HLS data and machine-learning techniques to develop near-seamless, weekly NDVI, expanding the spatiotemporal extent and increasing the spatial extent to cover most of the western United States.\n",
      "4341 The information provided in the faiss files does not directly address the question regarding the correlation between FPAR, LAI, and NDVI with sugarcane yield prediction using remote sensing spectrum. The papers focus on chronic pain management and the use of peripheral nerve blocks for chronic pain syndromes. Therefore, the relevant information for the question being asked is not present in the provided text.\n",
      "2130 The text discusses the use of hyperspectral technology and machine learning techniques to estimate soil total nitrogen content. It mentions the importance of accurately quantifying soil total nitrogen for precision fertilization and environmental reasons. Various estimation techniques, such as partial least squares regression (PLSR), have been studied for hyperspectral measurement related to total nitrogen content. Additionally, the text discusses the use of spectral transformations and soil color acquisition methods to improve the accuracy of total nitrogen estimations. Overall, the text provides information on the methods and technologies used to estimate soil total nitrogen content, but does not specifically address how environmental covariates like geomorphometric parameters and vegetation indices influence the spatial variability of total nitrogen content with remote sensing spectrum.\n",
      "4033 Spectral detection methods, such as those used in remote sensing, can be applied in the research of chronic pain and neuroplasticity to enhance understanding and treatment approaches. In the study of estimating brown Leaf Area Index (LAI(B)) using remote sensing spectrum, these methods can help in identifying specific spectral reflectance patterns associated with different levels of LAI(B) in Eucalyptus plantations. By analyzing the spectral data obtained from remote sensing, researchers can potentially correlate these patterns with physiological changes in the trees, similar to how spectral vegetation indices are used to estimate LAI in forests. This approach could provide valuable insights into the relationship between spectral characteristics and plant health, which could be applied to studying chronic pain and neuroplasticity in a similar manner.\n",
      "4167 The model can be improved by incorporating feature ranking methods such as SA GPR, SA SVR, ARD, and VIP methods, along with regression models like GPR, SVR, and PLSR. These methods can help in determining the most suitable model for Chl-a content estimation from remotely sensed data. Additionally, optimizing the initialization of parameters in the kernel function, prioritizing robustness in initializing these parameters from the data, and using the VIP method for feature ranking along with kernel machines for regression can be a good combination of methods to improve the model for better generalization to new ABI data obtained on future dates for Chl-a retrieval from remote sensing spectrum.\n"

      "1 The prediction of Chinese black tea ranking can be improved by incorporating different machine learning algorithms with Fourier transform near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy through the utilization of cognitive spectroscopy combined with evolutionary algorithms. This involves applying various spectral pretreating methods, such as standard normal variate transformation, multiplicative scatter correction, and min/max normalization, to eliminate noise and baseline drift. Additionally, employing evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization can help develop preferred characteristic variable modeling algorithms for enhanced learning efficiency. Finally, utilizing machine learning approaches like extreme learning machine, K-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine can aid in building cognitive models based on optimized characteristic wavelengths for qualitative analysis of Chinese black tea quality ranks.\n",
      "6 The Bayesian-based decomposition method in DRS allows for the approximation of absorption and scattering coefficients in bone and cartilage tissue by using a Markov model to reconstruct probability density spectra of μs and μa. This method provides a more accurate analysis by considering the statistical variance of data and error propagation within the model, leading to a deeper insight into the molecular composition and microstructure of the tissues.\n",
      "7 The ELM model was found to perform much faster than KNN, LS-SVM, and BP-ANN in the study of food classification using spectroscopy on all dimensionalities.\n",
      "750 The F1 score can be utilized in the classification of plastics based on Raman spectral analysis by evaluating the balance between precision and recall in the classification process. It provides a single metric that takes into account both false positives and false negatives, making it a useful measure of classification performance in this context. By optimizing the F1 score, the classification model can effectively differentiate between different types of plastics based on their Raman spectra with high accuracy.\n",
      "12 Based on the information provided in the related papers, extreme learning machines can be applied in the classification of diabetes and the measurement of blood glucose concentration noninvasively using Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy by employing a combination of near infrared spectroscopy and pattern recognition methods.

They used the Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS) method to remove abnormal samples and applied three spectral preprocessing methods and five characteristic wavelength selection algorithms for data processing. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were built and four machine learning algorithms (back propagation neural network, radial basis function neural network, extreme learning machine, and regression support vector machine) were used to establish F-v/F-m prediction models.

Methods: The researchers analyzed 1000 samples from grassland soils obtained from five different farm pairs corresponding to Adaptive Multi-Paddock (AMP) grazing and Conventional Grazing (CG). They tested the effect of calibration sample size ranging from 100 to 1000 samples and used three predictive models: partial least squares (PLS), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. The samples covered a 0-50 cm soil depth profile along a latitudinal gradient in the Southeast USA. ###\\n\\nP3. Conclusions: The sample size had only a moderate influence on the accuracy of SOC and N predictions using MIR spectroscopy. The predictive accuracy of all three models (PLS, RF, and SVM) was less affected by variation in sample size when more than 400 samples were used. The non-linear models (SVM and RF) performed similarly to the classical PLS model. The models performed better for deeper soil samples and were influenced by the particulate organic matter (POM) content in topsoil samples.

Methods: The researchers compared several multi-temporal feature sets, consisting of combinations of spectral bands, vegetation indices, principal component and tasselled cap transformations, as input to four machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbour, Random Forests, and Classification Trees). They used a challenging case study of visually and structurally homogenous scrub vegetation in Western Australia, with a classification scheme consisting of 24 target classes.

Conclusions: The results showed that a multi-temporal feature set combining autumn and spring images captured the phenological differences between the classes and produced the best results. The Support Vector Machines and Nearest Neighbour classifiers returned statistically superior results compared to Random Forests and Classification Trees. The SWIR spectral bands captured during spring, the greenness indices captured during spring, and the tasselled cap transformations derived from the autumn image were found to be the most informative.

Methods: The research focused on Echinocystis lobata, an annual vine species considered highly invasive in Europe. Hyperspectral data and on-ground reference data were collected in different phenological phases of the plant's development. The classification accuracy of the annual vine IAPS was assessed using F1 scores. The impact of synchronization between hyperspectral and on-ground data collection was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of classifications obtained synchronously and those obtained with mismatched temporal data. The potential improvement in classification accuracy through multitemporal image fusion was also examined. ###\\n\\nP3. Conclusions: The phenological phase in which the data is acquired was found to have a significant influence on the quality of the classification result for the annual vine IAPS. The period of flowering (summer) with the greatest coverage of the area with shoots was optimal for classification, resulting in an F1 classification accuracy of 0.87 +/- 0.04. The accuracy of classifications was lower for spring (F1 = 0.64 +/- 0.04) and autumn (F1 = 0.75 +/- 0.05). The lack of synchronization between hyperspectral and on-ground data collection led to a decrease in classification accuracy of up to 0.08. Multitemporal image fusion did not significantly improve the classification accuracy compared to classifications trained on images from a single phenological stage. The main conclusion is that mapping an annual vine IAPS using remote sensing and machine learning is possible and highly effective when the remote sensing and on-ground data are obtained in strict synchronization and the appropriate phenological phase.

The estimated Total Suspended Solids and absorption by Colored Dissolved Organic Matter at 440 nm from the three missions (OLI, MSI, and OLCI) were consistent within the uncertainty of the model, while the chlorophyll-a maps from MSI and OLCI achieved greater accuracy than those from OLI.

Methods: The study used multiple statistical and machine-learning methods to analyze the datasets. The effect of filter-based feature selection methods on predictive performance was compared.

Conclusions: The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm outperformed other algorithms such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions by at least three percentage points in terms of predictive performance. Certain combinations of feature sets showed small increases in predictive performance, while no substantial differences were observed between individual feature sets. Filter methods were found to achieve better predictive performances than using no feature selection in some combinations of learners and feature sets. Ensemble filters did not have a substantial impact on performance. The most important features were located around the red edge, and additional features in the near-infrared region (800-1000 nm) were also essential for achieving the overall best performances. Filter methods were found to be helpful in high-dimensional situations and improve the interpretation of feature effects in fitted models.

The best wavelengths and VIs for disease severity detection were selected based on the analysis. ###\\n\\nP3. Conclusions: The MLP method achieved the best classification rates, but with only 62.3% accuracy at low disease severity. However, the accuracy increased as the disease severity increased. The best wavelengths for differentiating between disease severity stages were identified, and the most significant VIs for disease detection were determined. The study suggests that spectral VIs and machine learning can enhance disease detection and monitoring for precision agriculture applications. ###\",\n",

Methods: The study used multiple statistical and machine-learning methods to analyze the datasets. The effect of filter-based feature selection methods on predictive performance was compared. Expert-based and data-driven feature sets derived from reflectance data were investigated. Defoliation of trees was modeled as a function of reflectance. Variable importance was assessed using permutation-based feature importance. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used and compared to other algorithms such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions. Ensemble filters were also evaluated. ###\\n\\nP3. Conclusions: The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm outperformed other algorithms such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions by at least three percentage points in terms of predictive performance. Certain combinations of feature sets showed small increases in predictive performance, while no substantial differences were observed between individual feature sets. Filter methods were found to achieve better predictive performances than using no feature selection in some combinations of learners and feature sets. Ensemble filters did not have a substantial impact on performance. The most important features were located around the red edge, and additional features in the near-infrared region (800-1000 nm) were also essential for achieving the overall best performances. Filter methods were found to be helpful in high-dimensional situations and improve the interpretation of feature effects in fitted models. However, more training data and replication in similar benchmarking studies are needed to generalize the results. ###\",\n",

Purpose: The purpose of the study was to improve the accuracy of estimating soil total nitrogen (TN) content using hyperspectral remote sensing by developing a synthetic color learning machine (SCLM) method. ###\\n\\nP2. Methods: Soil samples were collected from three locations in Hebei Province, China. The soil spectra were measured using an ASD FieldSpec 3 spectrometer in a dark room, and the TN content was determined using the Kjeldahl method. Based on synthetic soil color values acquired via reflectance spectra, 1254 TN models were established. The optimal model was obtained when the synthetic soil color was 0.1R + 0.5G + 0.4B and the fuzzy coefficient parameter was 7. The performance of the SCLM method was compared to the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model. ###\\n\\nP3. Conclusions: The SCLM method produced better performance outcomes (R (2)c/R(2)v = 0.881/0.803, RMSEc/RMSEv = 0.096 g/kg/0.135 g/kg, MREc/MREv = 6.162%/8.994%) than the PLSR model, indicating that it can potentially improve the estimation accuracy of TN by rapid and effective decoloring. The study suggests that further investigation into estimating TN using unmanned aviation vehicle hyperspectral images is warranted. ###\",\n",

Selected variables for LAI estimation included forest canopy cover, laser penetration index, canopy relief ratio, green normalized difference vegetation index, and normalized difference vegetation index. The accuracy of three machine learning algorithms (artificial neural networks, random forest, and support vector regression) was compared. ###\\n\\nP3. Conclusions: The support vector regression (SVR) method showed the best performance in terms of overall model accuracy and root mean square error (RMSE). The results indicate that remote sensing data applied through machine learning algorithms provide an effective method to estimate LAI in eucalypt plantations. The proposed methodology is directly applicable for operational forest planning at the landscape level. ###\",\n",
